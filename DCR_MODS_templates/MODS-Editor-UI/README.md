# DCR MODS Editor templates

Located here are blank MODS records pre-populated with fields used by specific projects, which have not been added as a repository-wide template option in the Edit Description menu.

To edit the description of an object using one of these pre-populated templates, select Edit Description from the gear menu. From there, select the Blank template.
