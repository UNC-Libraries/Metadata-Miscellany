          <dc:title>SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR AND COMORBIDITIES IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015) estimate that the prevalence of autism is currently 1 in 68 children. Although research over the last 30 years has been extensive and scientific advances have been extraordinary, much is still unknown about the
      phenomenology of ASD. Many children with ASD have extremely complex medical and psychological profiles, with numerous co-occurring conditions, such as sleep, seizure, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal disorders, many of which are just beginning to be understood.
      Among co-occurring conditions, self-injurious behavior (SIB) occurs in up to 50% of individuals with autism and has potentially severe consequences (Richards, Oliver, Nelson &amp; Moss, 2012). We currently have limited understanding of the etiology of SIB, and as one of the most serious and difficult-to-treat conditions in individuals with developmental disabilities (Russell, 2006), SIB affects the individual and his or her family in multiple contexts. A more in-depth understanding of factors most commonly associated with self-injury would be useful for the development of effective treatment strategies.
      The purpose of the current study was to examine these relationships in greater depth and address the gaps in the literature regarding the phenomenology of SIB. Client records were analyzed for 145 children with autism in a comprehensive center serving children with
      complex disabilities. Research questions addressed were: 1) What is the nature of distribution of SIB and health disorders in children diagnosed with autism at a residential treatment facility providing care for those with autism and other disabilities in New York State? 2) What are the significant relationships of SIB with other restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB) and adaptive skills? 3) What demographic characteristics, psychological and behavioral characteristics, and health disorders significantly predict SIB-Frequency and SIBSeverity?
      The predictor variables included age, gender, the Adaptive Behavior Composite, sensory processing, aggression, stereotypies, irritability, adaptive skills (communication, daily living skills, socialization), and medical conditions (gastrointestinal disorders, seizure disorders, vitamin D deficiencies). Findings indicated that various factors correlate with SIB, including aggression, stereotypies, irritability, the Adaptive Behavior Composite, communication, daily living skills, and socialization. Age, irritability, and the Adaptive Behavior Composite were found to significantly predict SIB.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Domestic architecture as rhetorical device: The gynaeconitis in Greek and Roman thought</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In this thesis, I explore the gap between persistent literary reference to the gynaeconitis, or &#x201C;women&#x2019;s quarters,&#x201D; and its elusive presence in the archaeological record, seeking to understand why it survived as a conceptual space in Roman literature several centuries after it supposedly existed as a physical space in fifth and fourth-century Greek homes. I begin my study by considering the origins of the gynaeconitis as a literary motif and contemplating what classical Greek texts reveal about this space. Reflecting on this information in light of the remains of Greek homes, I then look to Roman primary source material to consider why the gynaeconitis took up a strong presence in Roman thought. I argue that Roman writers, although far-removed from fifth and fourth-century Greek homes, found the gynaeconitis most useful as a mutable and efficient symbol of male control and a conceptual locus of identity formation.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: Over 900 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have been created  since 2010, and projections estimate that ACOs will manage the care for about one third of Americans by 2025; however, the impact of the MSSP on quality of care and patient outcomes is unclear. 
      Objective: This study compared outcomes before and after MSSP implementation for patients who were either (1) discharged from hospitals that chose to participate (N=273) versus not participate(N=1490) in MSSP or (2) assigned by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to a MSSP ACO versus not. I hypothesized that MSSP ACO participation would be associated with reduced inpatient utilization and improved outcomes of care. 
      Methods: Using a difference-in-difference (DD) design, I evaluated outcomes associated with MSSP in a national inpatient stroke registry, Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke, linked with Medicare claims for 2010-2015. Utilization outcomes of discharge to home, number of hospital admissions, and Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) were modeled using negative binomial models with a log link and offset. Outcomes of all-cause rehospitalization, recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality were modeled using Cox proportional hazards models. Outcomes of CMO or hospice enrollment within 2 weeks, hospice use within one year of hospitalization, hospice enrollment within 7 days of death, and live discharge from hospice were modeled using logistic regression. Except for discharge destination, all outcomes were followed for up to one year following discharge, with appropriate adjustment for death. 
      Key Findings: I found no evidence that hospital participation in the MSSP decreased inpatient utilization among stroke patients in the year following discharge; however, beneficiary ACO-alignment was associated with increases in subsequent admissions. Among patients most likely to benefit from palliative care, MSSP increased hospice enrollment and inpatient comfort measures, without increasing rates of live discharge. 
      Conclusion: Except for increased use of palliative care among stroke patients, current quality metrics and incentives in MSSP contracts may not be sufficient to generate changes in post-stroke care.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Early Athlete Sport Specialization and the Impact on Play and Burnout Mentalities in Division I College Athletes</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In recent years, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has stated an increased focus on health and wellness. It is important to understand an athlete&#x2019;s mental outlook in an effort to impede the likelihood of burnout as a result of negative sport experience. This study&#x2019;s focus is to assess the student-athlete's perspective as they approach their sport by examining the age of sport specialization and other independent variables.  Doing so can aid coaches in instituting more targeted measures (i.e. team bonding events, alteration of coaching style, etc.) in order for students to get the most out of their athletic experience. Additionally, understanding mitigating factors such as when an athlete started sport, gender, individual v. team sport and revenue v. Olympic sport factors could influence future parenting decisions and encourage sport-governing bodies to provide recommendations for better mental health accommodations.  The creation of the Play Mentalities Instrument (PMI-20) used in conjunction with the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire filled an important gap in research examining collegiate athletes mentalities toward their sport considering no study has combined the two measures to gain perspective on the mindset of Division I athletes.  As a result, an inverse relationship was uncovered between play and burnout.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEADERS&#x2019; COMPETENCIES OF EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND TEACHERS&#x2019; PERCEPTIONS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The purpose of this study was twofold.  It first sought to establish a comprehensive framework that clearly outlined the competencies a district level professional development leader should have to design, deliver, and evaluate professional development for educators.  Next, the domain competencies were aligned to specific professional development survey items found in the North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey.  The purpose of aligning the survey questions to the framework&#x2019;s domain competencies was to investigate the relationship of professional development leaders&#x2019; competencies to teachers&#x2019; perceptions of professional development using a causal-comparative design.  The following research questions guided the study:
      1.  Which theories and practices frame the essential knowledge and competencies for professional development leaders to effectively design, deliver, and evaluate professional development?  
      2.  How, if at all, do the competency levels of professional development leaders impact teachers&#x2019; perceptions of professional development in each domain? 
      This causal-comparative study used the results from the 2014 North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey (NCTWCS) and a self-assessment survey of professional development leaders&#x2019; competencies.  Those data were used to determine if the competency levels of professional development leaders impact teachers&#x2019; perceptions of professional development in their district.  A regression analysis was conducted using professional development leader competency as a predictor of teachers&#x2019; perceptions in each of the three domains.  The researcher then conducted a multiple regression model to explore if the differences in how leaders perceived their competency and teachers&#x2019; perceptions of professional development in each domain were predicted by district wealth.  The regression models revealed that a district&#x2019;s wealth was not a predictor of the differences found within each domain.  The results were not statistically significant with both regression models, indicating that teachers&#x2019; perceptions of professional development were not impacted by the district&#x2019;s wealth nor the competency level of the professional development leader.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Is a Woman&#x2019;s Voice &#x2018;Awra?: Gendered Muslim Voices in Twentieth-Century Egypt</dc:title>

          <dc:description>&#x201C;Is a woman&#x2019;s voice &#x2018;awra?&#x201D; is a question that abounds on online fatwa forums and expresses the contemporary concern surrounding the appropriateness of Muslim women&#x2019;s voices relative to their bodies. This paper presents an initial foray into the historical roots of this question by examining women&#x2019;s voices in twentieth-century Egypt with particular attention to the impact of audio technologies. I argue that women&#x2019;s voices became a site of cultural contestation during the early and mid twentieth century, which combined with the anxieties surrounding religion in the 1970s and 1980s with rise of the &#x201C;New Islam&#x201D; to produce this contemporary question. I draw attention to the political stakes of Muslim women&#x2019;s voices in twentieth-century Egypt, specifically, and point to the broader relevance of women&#x2019;s voices across diverse contexts. Far from conclusive, this paper offers an argument that in turn poses many more questions for further historical and ethnographic investigation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Science of the Breath in Persianate India</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation examines a series of Persian manuscripts containing Indian divination practices centered on knowledge of the breath. In Sanskrit, these breathing practices are known shiva-svarodaya (the texts are presented as a dialogue between Shiva and Parvati). Svara refers to &#x201C;voiced breath,&#x201D; thus the term roughly translates as &#x201C;attainment of voiced breath.&#x201D; In the 13th CE, these practices are translated from Sanskrit into Persian in a text titled the Kamarupanchashika (&#x201C;the 50 verses of Kamaru&#x201D;). This dissertation analyzes the different abridgments of the Kamarupanchashika that circulate from the 14th CE onwards throughout India and Iran. The authors of these texts use the phrase `ilm-i dam, &#x201C;the science of the breath,&#x201D; to describe this knowledge. 
      This project examines the process through which these practices came to be integrated within Islamicate knowledge production in India and Iran, as well as how they factor in Euro-American analyses of Islam and Sufism during and after the European colonial period. Chapter One is an introduction to the project and to several of the key foundation texts that serve as necessary background knowledge upon which the remaining chapters build. Chapter Two locates this project within the Islamicate engagement with India (Arabic and Persian: al-Hind) by surveying key authors writing in Arabic and Persian about this region from the 9th-16th centuries CE, ending with an examination of Abu&#x2019;l Fazl ibn Mubark, court historian to the Mughal emperor Akbar, and the way that `ilm-i dam appears in the A&#x2019;in-i Akbari (&#x201C;The Institutes of Akbar&#x201D;). Chapter Three places `ilm-i dam in the broader context of other Indian practices such as yoga and Ayurveda, asking the question of how all of these ways of knowing understand the body and its relationship to the world around it. Chapters Four and Five analyze the way that `ilm-i dam has been received by scholars in Iran and Europe, respectively, comparing how these two interpretive communities categorize `ilm-i dam differently. While the former groups it with practical tools that are distinct from Sufism, the latter associates it with Sufism and Hinduism. Analyzing the motivations and outcomes of these categorizations is key for this project.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This thesis examines how the United States (US) and European Union (EU) have developed foreign aid programs to further their security goals. The securitization of foreign aid has evolved as security threats have changed over time, and the evolution of US and EU aid policies has raised the question of how security objectives are incorporated into development policies.  This thesis demonstrates that the EU has securitized foreign aid by briefly exploring the case of securitized aid in the US, tracing institutional changes within the EU, and explaining specific EU instruments and partnerships that securitize aid.  As the international area continues to intensify and become more complex, the EU must strengthen its current tools or create more vehicles to carry out security and foreign aid priorities.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The relatively large genomes of eukaryotic cells must be organized and compacted within the nucleus while maintaining DNA accessibility for essential processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair. This organization is accomplished in large part through the interaction of DNA with histone proteins to form a structure known as chromatin. Chromatin organization is regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) or the differential incorporation of variant or canonical histones into chromatin. These processes are regulated differently throughout the genome, leading to functionally distinct chromatin environments. Regions where DNA is &#x201C;open&#x201D; or more accessible are collectively referred to as euchromatin, whereas &#x201C;closed&#x201D; or inaccessible regions are classified as heterochromatin. Proper heterochromatin formation is essential for regulating numerous cellular processes including, cell division, nuclear organization, gene expression, and DNA replication. A defining feature of heterochromatin is methylation of lysine nine on histone H3 (H3K9me), a histone PTM that recruits Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1). Although H3K9 methyltransferases and HP1 are necessary for proper heterochromatin structure, the specific contribution of H3K9 to heterochromatin function and animal development is unknown. Using our recently developed platform to engineer histone genes in Drosophila, I generated H3K9R mutant flies, separating the functions of H3K9 and non-histone substrates of H3K9 methyltransferases. I observed that H3K9 plays an essential role in regulating the structure of pericentromeric heterochromatin and the repression of transposons, but not protein-coding gene expression. Furthermore, I generated a K9R mutation in the variant histone H3.3, revealing functional redundancies between variant H3.3K9 and canonical H3K9, though to differing extents in heterochromatin and euchromatin. Finally, I have used the H3K9R mutant as a tool to uncover general principles of genome regulation. Several previous studies have identified correlations between histone PTMs, transcription, and DNA replication; however, no causative relationship between these processes has been identified. The H3K9R mutant specifically disrupts pericentromeric heterochromatin providing a unique opportunity to determine the direct consequences of altered chromatin structure on replication. We demonstrated that changes in chromatin accessibility and most likely transcription are required but not sufficient for altered replication, influencing the framework through which we view genome regulation.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: School nurses intervene with students, families, and school staff to maintain or improve the health and academic success of students. To display school nurse impact on student health and success, their work must be identified and measured. Although some data on school nursing services exist, datasets are disparate, not standardized. Examining the impact of school nurses on student health and education outcomes is necessary to illustrate the need for students to have access to a school nurse each day.
      Purpose: This is a three-manuscript dissertation. Chapter 2 presents an integrative review of the literature that explores school nurse interventions, activities, and student health and education outcomes. Chapter 3 presents the results that describe trends in data for North Carolina public schools of school nurse health services and programs, utilized by grade level. Chapter 4 examines the impact of school nurse-to-student ratios, and health services and programs on student outcomes.
      Methods: Chapter 2 is an integrative review that uses the Framework for 21st Century School Nursing Practice to explore school nurse interventions and activities, and student outcome measures. Chapter 3 presents results of longitudinal repeated measures study that used generalized linear modeling and Poisson regression to test the effect of time and grade on trends of school nurse health services and programs in North Carolina public schools, stratified by grade level. Chapter 4 used generalized linear modeling with a gamma distribution to estimate the association between school nurse-to-student ratios and health services and programs on the outcomes of students with asthma and diabetes. 
      Results: Over time, more students were identified with various health conditions, and had more orders for health care procedures to be conducted in the school setting. Also, lower school nurse-to-student ratios were associated with some improved student health and education outcomes in students with asthma and diabetes. 
      Conclusions: School nurses do have an impact on student outcomes. There is an identified need to find determine the impact of school nurse interventions on school nurse sensitive indicator.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>U.S. HOUSEHOLD PURCHASES OF NO- AND LOW-SUGAR PRODUCTS FROM KEY FOOD GROUP SOURCES OF ADDED SUGAR, 2002-2014</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Despite recent declines in added sugar intake, population sugar consumption remains above recommended levels. More than two thirds of added sugars consumed in the U.S. comes from stores, and more than 75% of added sugars consumed comes from the top eight food and beverage group sources. As such, widespread public and private efforts to promote purchases of no- and low- sugar alternatives to these foods and beverages are seen as promising strategies to reduce population sugar consumption. 
      However, trends in household no- and low-sugar products purchases in these eight key food groups have not been assessed over this time period. Further, there are concerns that ongoing efforts to promote no- and low- sugar products will not equitably reach minority and low-income populations, and may unintentionally increase consumption of low-calorie sweeteners. We currently do not know whether there are racial/ethnic and income differences in purchases of these products. We additionally do not know what proportion of no- and low-sugar product purchases contain low-calorie sweeteners. 
      One reason for the scarcity of research on no- and low-sugar purchases is that there is no comprehensive, consistent definition of low-sugar used in the U.S.. The FDA does not currently define low-sugar. Previous research has alternatively used definitions that focus on calories per labelled servings, which are not consistent across brands and products, or on low-calorie sweetener consumption, which does not capture all low-sugar products. 
      This research addressed these gaps using the 2002-2014 Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel. Homescan captures year-long household purchases of packaged foods by providing households with a barcode scanner. Scanned barcodes are then linked to product specific nutrient information, including total sugar content, package volume or weight, and ingredients lists. This product specific information facilitates our classification of no- and low-sugar products in eight key food and beverage groups.  We then used Homescan&#x2019;s nationally representative sample of household purchases to examine trends in no- and low-sugar product purchases from 2002 through 2014 in these eight food groups. We also examined cross-sectional differences in no- and low-sugar product purchases by household race/ethnicity and income for each year from 2002 through 2014. Finally, we examined trends in the proportion of no- and low-sugar purchases that contain different types of sweeteners.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study focuses on works depicting same-sex desire among women written after the publication of Amora (1989), considered to be the first lesbian novel in Mexico, in order to examine developments since its publication. By analyzing works by authors such as Artemisa T&#xE9;llez, Cristina Rivera Garza, Valeria Luiselli, M&#xF3;nica Lav&#xED;n, and Criseida Santos Guevara, among others, I unpack how these works challenge the heteronormative, patriarchal society of contemporary Mexico. In the four chapters of this dissertation, I explore topics often overlooked when discussing lesbianism in Mexico&#x2019;s literary and cultural productions, such as female masculinity, race, class, and social engagement. My theoretical framework draws from a variety of theorists and critics based in Mexico and the U.S., including Jack Halberstam, Walter Mignolo, Gloria Anzald&#xFA;a, Marta Lamas, and Francesca Gargallo. This transnational scholarly perspective facilitates a productive discussion that helps to understand the ways in which late 20th and early 21st-century experiences and ideas circulate beyond the boundaries of the nation state.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In epidemiological studies and disease prevention trials, interest often lies in the relationship between certain disease endpoint and some exposure of interest. When the event is rare and/or some of the covariate information are quite expensive to collect for the entire cohort, case-cohort designs are widely used to reduce the financial cost of the study while achieving the same study goals. The case-cohort sampling scheme entails the random sampling of individuals, called the sub-cohort, along with all the cases. In the situation when the event rate is not low but resources are limited, the generalized case-cohort design is more appropriate, where only a fraction of cases are sampled along with the sub-cohort. In this dissertation, we consider two aspects of case-cohort studies. One is for statistical methods for the analysis of recurrent events and the other concerns power/sample size calculation for interaction test.
      Many methods for the analysis of data from case-cohort studies have been proposed in the literature. However, most of these methods are for either a single event or multitude of events of different types on the same subject. There has not been much work on the recurrent events data under case-cohort sampling scheme. Valid statistical methods that take into account the correlation between the events from the same individual needs to be developed. In this dissertation, the first two topics are related to recurrent events. We consider modeling the recurrent events using the rate model under the original and generalized case-cohort designs. The first topic considers the multiplicative rates model and the second topic considers additive rates models. For both types of the rate models, we propose weighted estimating equation approach for the parameter estimates for both sampling designs. We showed that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We conducted simulation studies to examine the performance of our proposed estimators in finite samples and they performed well. For the multiplicative rates model, we illustrated the proposed method to assess the relationship between prior measles infection and acute lower-respiratory-infections (ALRI) in a double-blinded randomized clinical trial, conducted in Brazil. We illustrated our proposed method for additive rates model to study the effect of FEV1 on the recurrence of pulmonary exacerbation in patients with cystic fibrosis.
      In the third topic, we address another aspect of the case-cohort design. All the previous work in the literature concern sample size and power calculation in case-cohort data for a dichotomized main effect. However, in certain situations, one might be interested in the
      association of a covariate and time to event response in different biomarker groups, which may be expensive to measure. We extend the existing idea for the single binary main effect to the interaction between the variable and the dichotomized biomarker in the presence of a rare event. We propose different power formulas based on the simplification of a generalized log-rank test for the case-cohort design. A cost efficiency formula comparing the case-cohort design to a simple random sample is derived. We examine the performance of the bounds based on the same test. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the efficiency for the case-cohort design. We illustrate the use of the formula based on information from the pooled databases of Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation concerns several statistical problems arising in Naval Engineering which relate to statistical uncertainty and characterizing rare events, and naturally involve a stochastic component to be accounted for through statistical methods. Chapter 1 has been adapted from Glotzer and Pipiras [43] and provides an overview of the problems to be discussed in later chapters. In Chapter 2, statistical inference of a probability of exceeding a large critical value is studied in the peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. The focus is on assessing the performanceofvariousconfidenceintervalsfortheexceedanceprobability,andseveralapproaches to uncertainty reduction are considered. This chapter has been published as Glotzer et al. [44]. Chapter 3 concerns the study of a single-degree-of-freedom random oscillator with a piecewise linear restoring force (experiencing softening after a certain point value of the response, called a &#x201C;knuckle&#x201D; point), with the goal of understanding the structure of the distribution tail of its response or (local) maximum. The random oscillator considered here serves as a prototypical model for ship roll motion in beam seas. A theoretical analysis is carried out first by focusing on the maximum and response after crossing the knuckle point, where explicit calculations can be performed assuming standard distributions for the derivative at the crossing; and second by considering the white noise random external excitation, where the stationary distribution of the response is readily available from the literature. Both approaches reveal the structure of the distribution tails where a Gaussian core is followed by a heavier tail, possibly having a power-law form, ultimately resulting in a tail having a finite upper bound. The extent of the light tail region is shown to be the
      iii
      result of conditioning on the system not reaching the unstable equilibrium (associated with &#x201C;capsizing&#x201D;). In Chapter 4, the distributions of certain response rates of the above random oscillator are investigated analytically and numerically. These include the minimum response rate leading to capsizing, referred to as the critical response rate, and the split-time metric, which measures the closeness of an observed response rate to the critical response rate and is used to assess the probability of capsizing. Three nonlinear restoring forces are considered: piecewise linear (experiencing linearly softening stiffness above a knuckle point), doubly piecewise linear (experiencing piecewise linearly softening stiffness above a knuckle point), and the cubic restoring force of the Duffing oscillator. Numerical simulation of the critical response rate and split-time metric is proposed from a derived distribution in the first two cases; in the latter case, the density of the critical response rate is approximated assuming white noise excitation. The distribution of the split-time metric is found to have a &#x201C;light&#x201D; tail, motivating the use of an exponential distribution or a Weibull distribution tail rather than the generalized Pareto distribution for exceedances above threshold in the POT approach. Finally, Chapter 5 considers inference for the mean and variance of a stationary continuous-time stochastic process, for which the so-called long-run variances of the process and its square play a central role. The well-known problem of estimating the non-zero long-run variances is revisited here in the context of random oscillatory processes such as random (non-)linear oscillators and related models. The less studied case of the zero long-run variance is also considered. The approaches are extended to the situation where multiple independent records of the stochastic process are available, by introducing an estimator of the long-run variance which improves on other natural candidate estimators. A simulation study is provided to assess the performance of the proposed methods in estimating the long-run variances and constructing confidence intervals.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Avignon Manuscript and the Transmission of Rufinus' Translation of Origen's Peri Archon</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Origen&#x2019;s Peri Archon was one of the most comprehensive and influential works of early Christian theology&#x2014;but despite its extraordinary influence, it was condemned as heretical in the fifth century. Although the Greek original does not survive apart from a handful of quotations, it had (fortunately for us) been translated into Latin by the fourth-century theologian Rufinus of Aquileia. His Latin version, De principiis, survives, but only in a small number of faulty, lacunose manuscripts. The most authoritative edition of De principiis, Paul Koetschau&#x2019;s 1913 edition, is profoundly inadequate. Koetschau had correctly determined that one family of manuscripts, the alpha branch, preserved the most accurate text, but he used only one manuscript from this branch (one from Reichenau). Four more manuscripts from the superior alpha branch have since been identified, but three have been neither collated nor cited in any edition of the work. Their existence alone would necessitate a thorough study of these manuscripts; but additionally, my research indicates that Koetschau&#x2019;s edition does not cite the Reichenau manuscript systematically, nor does he identify the sources for a number of his variant readings. There is no edition of Rufinus&#x2019; text, then, that accurately incorporates evidence from all the available manuscripts from the superior alpha branch&#x2014;not just the Reichenau manuscript, but also those from Avignon, Berlin, Weissenburg, and Fulda.
      This dissertation is the first study of all of the alpha manuscripts, and it lays the groundwork for a more complete and more accurate edition of De principiis. Scholars of theology, patristics, and ecclesial history will benefit from an improved edition of Rufinus&#x2019; work, through which they will have a better understanding of one of the most important dogmatic works of early Christianity, Origen&#x2019;s Peri Arch&#x14D;n.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Are Schools Prepared for Suicide Contagion Effects? An Analysis of School Psychologists&#x2019; Perceived Competency in Suicide Postvention Response</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Suicide is a leading cause of death of school-aged youth, with adolescent and young adult populations considered to be most at risk for suicide clusters and contagion effects (CDC, 2015; Insel &amp; Gould, 2008). Suicide clusters have been documented in school districts across the U.S., though the degree to which schools are prepared to provide postvention services in the wake of a suicide is presently unclear (Canady, 2016; Robinson et al., 2013; Stack, 2003). Due to the lack of evidenced-based postvention programs, school-based clinicians rely upon their clinical judgement to effectively and responsibly provide postvention services to a school community following a suicide.  School psychologists are considered integral members of the crisis response teams that are charged with conducting this sensitive response effort, though the current literature is largely absent of works that address their beliefs about their knowledge, confidence, and preparedness to provide postvention services (Debski et al., 2007; Schmidt, 2016). 
      For the present study, the Postvention Competency Survey was developed and administered to 111 school psychologists to ascertain their perceived knowledge and self-efficacy in suicide postvention and suicide contagion effects. In addition, school psychologists reported on their school districts&#x2019; approach to preparing for postvention response through training opportunities, the presence of postvention protocols, and the establishment of crisis teams. Regression analyses were also conducted to identify factors predictive of postvention competency. 
      Descriptive results indicated that all school districts had established crisis teams, yet only half of the respondents endorsed that their district had a protocol to guide the response efforts. Nearly 70% of the sample indicated formal training in postvention, though over 50% reported that their district had not offered such training in the past four years. The majority of respondents endorsed less than moderate knowledge, preparedness, and confidence in suicide postvention, and even lower degrees of competency in suicide contagion effects. Regression analyses supported formal training as a significant predictor of both perceived knowledge and self-efficacy, while the presence of a postvention protocol was not significant for either outcome. Overall, results suggest that schools may benefit from improving their approach to preparing for student suicides, and particularly suicide contagion effects. Recommendations to enhance school psychologists&#x2019; postvention competence are offered, and directions for future research to expand upon this preliminary work are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins to form functional protein products are a key level of cellular signaling regulation. Because of this, there has been an immense effort in the proteomics community to improve quantitative enrichment, acquisition, and bioinformatics strategies for the analysis of PTMs to probe metabolic pathways. The identification of dynamic protein phosphorylation events, a vital PTM, is especially important for understanding kinase/ phosphatase-regulated signaling pathways, and is the focus of this dissertation. The aim of this dissertation is to develop and apply phosphoproteomic strategies in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to characterize the role of protein phosphorylation on cellular regulation in a diverse array of signaling networks.
      Techniques for algal cell culturing, protein extraction, quantitative enrichment, acquisition and bioinformatics processing developed and adapted for Chlamydomonas are discussed (Chapter 2). Using these techniques, a quantitative workflow for a dual enrichment strategy to target intact protein kinases via capture on immobilized multiplexed inhibitor beads with subsequent proteolytic digestion of unbound proteins and peptide-based phosphorylation enrichment was developed (Chapter 3). This workflow obtained quantitative coverage on 115 protein kinases and 2,304 phosphopeptides. Application of the quantitative phosphoproteomic pipeline was employed to study the effect of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase inhibition on the Chlamydomonas phosphoproteome in wild-type (Chapter 4) and extension into a rapamycin hypersensitive mutant line (Chapter 5). From the wild-type study, three TOR inhibitors with varying mechanisms of inhibition were used to obtain quantitative coverage on 2,547 unique phosphosites with 258 phosphosites differentially changing following inhibition. This approach identified Chlamydomonas homologs of TOR signaling-related proteins such as RPS6 and LARP1 that had decreased phosphorylation upon TORC1 inhibition. Additionally, this led to follow-up experiments guided by our phosphoproteomic findings showing that carotenoid levels are affected by TORC1 inhibition, the first evidence that carotenoid production is under TOR control. From the rapamycin hypersensitive mutant study, the workflow obtained quantitative coverage on 2,699 phosphosites with 316 sites changing following rapamycin treatment. This study showed similarities with the sites modulated in the wild-type study described in Chapter 4 while also providing another distinct group of phosphosites not previously interrogated.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Royal Sanctity and the Writing of History on the Peripheries of Latin Christendom, c. 1000 - 1200</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the edges of Latin Christendom were expanding outwards as new peoples along its northern and eastern peripheries converted to the Christian faith, including the Danes, Norwegians, and Hungarians. Closely related to this process of Christianization was the centralization of traditionally disunited peoples into unitary polities under the rule of new royal dynasties. These early kings used their novel political authority to patronize religious men and houses, found episcopal institutions, and enforce Christian observance amongst their peoples, and in turn they wielded the spiritual legitimacy offered by their new faith to bolster their dynastic ambitions. Founder-kings such as Kn&#xFA;tr IV of Denmark, &#xD3;l&#xE1;fr II Haraldsson of Norway, Stephen I of Hungary, and Ladislaus I of Hungary were central to the emergence of their Christian kingdoms: and in death, they came to be venerated as their peoples&#x2019; first Christian saints.
      This dissertation explores the centrality of royal sanctity to the historical traditions of medieval Norway, Denmark, and Hungary. It asks what role was attributed to holy kings in the foundation of the northern and eastern kingdoms by native historians who, for the first time, were textually codifying their peoples&#x2019; pasts in chronicles, sagas, and saints&#x2019; lives. Royal sanctity was both a powerful and fraught category in that it united two types of authority, secular and spiritual, which had had a fraught interrelationship within the tradition of western Christian thought. Throughout the early Middle Ages, kings who had achieved posthumous sanctification had traditionally done so by renouncing their royal office in order to perfect themselves spiritually. This dissertation argues that the eleventh and twelfth century represents a distinct historical moment during which the concept of royal sanctity provided a particularly useful vocabulary for conceptualizing the emergence of new Christian polities on the edges of Latin Christendom. It did so because of, rather than in spite of, the internal tension between the identities of the king and the saint. Its duality allowed historians on the Christian peripheries to speak to both the religious and political transformation of their societies, and to explore in subtle ways the interrelations between kingship and salvation.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Flavor-Dependent Effects of E-cigarette Liquids and their Chemical Constituents on Lung Epithelial Toxicity and Cell Ca2+ Signaling</dc:title>

          <dc:description>E-cigarettes (e-cigs) are a cigarette alternative that do not contain tobacco or tar, and whose e-liquids are available in over 7,000 flavors.  While marketed as a safer smoking alternative, the basic health effects of vaping commercially available e-liquids and their constituent components (i.e., propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, flavors) are not well understood.  However, inhalation of diacetyl (butter flavor) has been shown to cause bronchiolitis obliterans (&#x2018;Popcorn Lung&#x2019;).  In this dissertation, we sought to better understand the biological effects of flavored e-liquids and their chemical constituents on airway cells.
      We first screened 13 flavored e-liquids, PG/VG, and nicotine for toxicity in a pulmonary epithelial cell line.  We demonstrated that the responses were both dose- and flavor-dependent by exposing cells to either the unheated or heated (aerosolized) e-liquids.  4 of 13 flavored e-liquids had more pronounced toxicity effects than the PG/VG base or other flavors, and did not share a flavoring chemical between them that might be universally toxic.  We then demonstrated that the toxic effects that we were measuring were either due to (1) direct cytotoxicity or (2) inhibiting cell proliferation.  We further explored the ability of flavored e-liquids to inhibit cell proliferation by characterizing their effects on intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which can affect cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Specifically, we demonstrated that a Banana Pudding-flavored e-liquid could stimulate phospholipase C-dependent inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate generation leading to ER Ca2+ depletion and elevations in cytosolic Ca2+.  Moreover, we screened 100 additional e-liquids and found 42 of 100 elicited cytosolic Ca2+ responses, suggesting many flavors can alter Ca2+ homeostasis.  Analysis of their chemical constituents correlated the presence of common flavorings (e.g., ethyl vanillin, vanillin, and ethyl maltol) with the cytosolic Ca2+ responses.  Additional testing confirmed that those flavors caused dose-dependent Ca2+ signaling.  Altered Ca2+ homeostasis can have profound effects on airway physiology and has been implicated in disease (i.e., cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammation).  Therefore, these products should be further assessed for their flavor-dependent effects on airway physiology (e.g., Ca2+ homeostasis) and potential consequences of long-term inhalation toxicity from chronic vaping.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Despite the importance that many people today place on intimacy, there has been surprisingly little philosophical work done on the topic. This essay attempts to partially fill this lacuna by offering an account of some characteristic features of intimate interactions and providing the beginning steps towards a more nuanced view of intimacy. In short, the claim I will defend is that intimate interactions between people generally involve an instance of disclosure about something personal (by at least one person involved in the interaction) that is picked up by an empathetic individual, resulting in a specific kind of understanding of what&#x2019;s being shared, and that is marked with a shared recognition that this kind of understanding has occurred. I&#x2019;ll develop this point by looking at a few of the existing accounts of intimacy and a specific example from film.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Growing evidence suggests that vagus nerve activity is an important aspect of social functioning.  For instance, vagus nerve activity is linked to positive emotions, low-arousal states, social approach motivations, and emotion recognition, expression, and regulation.  By modifying a relatively new manipulation technique &#x2013; transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) &#x2013; we experimentally test the relationship between vagus nerve activity and social functioning, hypothesizing that participants receiving tVNS, compared to sham stimulation, will self-report more positive affect and less arousal, have greater accuracy in emotion recognition, perceive others as more trustworthy and less threatening, and have higher implicit and explicit motivations for social affiliation.  One hundred and twenty-six undergraduate students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment.  Results support the hypothesis that tVNS, compared to sham stimulation, improves emotion recognition accuracy. Limitations of the current study as well as the basic and clinical implications of this methodology and initial finding are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Acquired resistance to anti-cancer therapy presents a critical challenge to effective clinical management of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  Drug-resistant CML cells devise diverse molecular adaptations to evade therapy.  Examples of such adaptations include: target (Bcr-Abl) mutations that eliminate drug binding, target amplification, up-regulation of drug exporter proteins, and activation of alternative kinase(s).  The CML cell (Myl-R) model described in this dissertation is a classic example of how CML cells can activate alternative kinase(s) to promote cell survival.  Herein, I discuss two molecular adaptations regulated by Lyn in Myl-R cells.  
           In the first project, I showed that increased Lyn expression and activity in Myl-R cells up-regulated the expression and stability of BIRC6, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family known to bind and inactivate active caspases.  BIRC6&#x2019;s role in promoting imatinib resistance was confirmed by the 15-fold increase in imatinib sensitivity upon BIRC6 shRNA knockdown.  Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Lyn reduced BIRC6 expression and stability.  Further, BIRC6 stability was increased via Lyn-dependent phosphorylation of serine residues in a region that overlapped with caspase cleavage motifs.  Pharmacological inhibition of Lyn resulted in caspase-mediated degradation of BIRC6.  
           In the second project, I am investigating Lyn&#x2019;s role in regulating creatine uptake by Myl-R cells.  Our lab previously showed that total intracellular creatine pool was 5-fold higher in Myl-R than Myl cells.  Our unpublished data show that the increased intracellular creatine comes from uptake from the cell culture media and not de novo synthesis.  I, therefore, investigated the role of creatine in Myl-R cells by incubating the cells in normal growth media into which competitive inhibitors of creatine uptake were added. Our data show that reduction in total intracellular creatine pool lowered cell viability.  Others previously showed that the Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity was critical for creatine uptake.  Our data show that Lyn inhibition or shRNA knockdown reduced Na+/K+-ATPase activity and total intracellular creatine pool, suggesting a tripartite signaling cascade that supports Myl-R cell survival.  
           Taken together, these studies enrich our understanding of the diverse therapy-survival mechanisms utilized by CML cells, and provide insights into novel targets for effective cure of CML.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LOWER EXTREMITY MOVEMENT QUALITY, VISUAL PERFORMANCE, AND HEAD IMPACT BIOMECHANICS IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine if movement quality, and visual performance were associated with head impact biomechanics in high school football players. We also examined potential relationships between our performance metrics, the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) and Senaptec Sensory Station tablet tests. Throughout football season, we monitored head impacts using the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS). Peak linear and rotational accelerations of head impacts were modeled using random intercept general mixed models. We used logistic regressions to examine relationships between visual performance metrics and LESS performance group. Good movers did not experience lower head impact magnitudes than poor movers. Few associations were found between visual performance and head impact magnitudes. We conclude that the LESS and the Senaptec Sensory Station tablet tests may not be the ideal tools for understanding magnitude of head impacts in high school football players, and are not significantly related to each other.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Constrained Choices: Latina Immigrants Negotiating Work, Family, and Legality in the New South</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Undocumented people are often described as living and working &#x201C;in the shadows.&#x201D; This framing identifies the illegality of migrants as an individual characteristic. Yet federal, state, and local policies are structural features that shape the meaning and consequences of being unauthorized in the United States. Latinas have increasingly joined migration streams and now constitute 46 percent of unauthorized people in the United States. 
      In this dissertation, I identify the constraints and opportunities for Latina immigrant workers in North Carolina, a new destination state. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 48 women, as well as a focus group with women from five North Carolina counties, I analyze women&#x2019;s experiences with work, family, and migration across the life course. Women&#x2019;s accounts revealed that workers&#x2019; identities were frequently formed through early labor force participation in their countries of origin. Once in the United States, women&#x2019;s labor force participation was increasingly constrained by employment restrictions targeting the undocumented at the same time that they faced the pull of family demands as they married and had children. 
      In response to these constraints, women turned to work in so-called &#x201C;nonstandard&#x201D; employment relationships such as subcontracted work and self-employment. In some cases, these arrangements represent a survival strategy associated with exploitation and poor job quality. In other cases, nonstandard employment suggests a &#x201C;strategy of resistance&#x201D; in which women create mobility pathways associated with improved job quality and the achievement of work-family balance. Findings contribute to understanding the macro- and micro-level forces shaping intersectional inequality for U.S. immigrant populations and hold policy implications at state and federal levels.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Public Health Nurse Intervention for Depression Screening during Sexually Transmitted Disease Risk Assessments</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (2016) recommends screening adolescents and adults for depression. Depression screening is important during sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk assessments due to the association between depression and STD risk behavior. STD Enhanced Role Registered Nurses (ERRNs) are ideally positioned to incorporate depression screening into STD risk assessments.
      Purposes:
      1.  Expand the STD ERRNs' education to include an understanding of the association of depression with STD risk factors, be able to identify those at high risk for depression, and give them an evidence-based tool to screen for depression, thus enhancing the STD ERRNs' comfort and self-efficacy to screen for depression to facilitate evidence-based practice change in the clinical setting 
      2.  Provide the STD ERRNs with a temporary policy addendum and depression screening guidelines to support them as they perform depression screens in the STD clinic
      Methods: A Needs Assessment Survey was given to STD ERRNs to determine knowledge and practice gaps. A pilot educational course was provided to one local health department (LHD). A temporary policy addendum was created and granted to eliminate the policy barrier. The course, pretest, and posttest were sent to all remaining STD ERRNs. Two follow-up surveys were sent to determine depression screening goal attainment, barriers, and supportive factors. 
      Results: The Needs Assessment Survey found a low percentage of STD ERRNs screened for depression due to time and policy barriers. Pilot LHD feedback included changes to the screening tool and development of an implementation timeline. The course showed an improvement in comfort levels with administering depression screens and reported improved knowledge of depression and risk for STDs. The follow-up surveys showed that the majority of STD ERRNs were able to meet or exceed their depression screening goals, although some STD ERRNs experienced a time barrier related to the referral process.
      Limitations: Limitations included the reliability/validity of the pretest and posttest test questions, self-report nature of the survey questions, and small sample size (Phase 1 n = 63; Phase 2 n = 35; Phase 3 1st follow-up n = 14, Phase 3 2nd follow-up n = 17).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>THE PROPORTION OF CORE SPECIES IN A COMMUNITY VARIES WITH SPATIAL SCALE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Ecologists define a community as the set of species successfully reproducing and using resources in a shared space. In lieu of a species list, the subset of temporally persistent core species may more appropriately fulfill this definition. Analyses carried out in communities that support low proportions of core species may violate assumptions about the definition of a community, and so poorly align with ecological predictions. We used bird time series data to calculate the proportion of core species across a gradient of scales, to investigate potential generalities in this pattern, and to use these generalities to address discrepancies on drivers of community assembly. We found that the proportion of core species in an assemblage increased in a positive curve with scale and decreased with high environmental heterogeneity (e.g. elevation, vegetation coverage). Communities with high heterogeneity and low proportions of core species were likely dispersal-driven, not resource-limited.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>We often presume that &#x201C;anatomy&#x201D; is, simply, the scientific practice of deconstructing and dissecting the body. &#x201C;&#x2018;This Seemingly So Solid Body&#x2019;: Philosophical Anatomy and Victorian Fiction,&#x201D; returns us to a period in the nineteenth-century when stable ideas of what it meant to anatomize and who could be an anatomist were undergoing serious challenge by a group of investigators interested in a now forgotten epistemology: philosophical anatomy. In the most straightforward sense of the term, philosophical anatomy describes the attempt to find universal forms and ideal structures common to all organisms through the practices of comparative anatomy. Philosophical anatomists saw the work of anatomy as one not specific to scientific communities, but common across many disciplines. I argue that philosophical anatomy reconstitutes anatomizing as more than a reductive, materialist science. Anatomizing, in this context, exceeds the simple dissection and reduction of human and animal bodies and becomes, instead, a creative reimagining of how such bodies relate to each other and even to non-human forces and energies. Studying the ways in which Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, and George Eliot engage philosophical anatomy in their literary works, I reveal how philosophical anatomy profoundly shapes our present representational and interpretive practices.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>How is the internet changing the way citizens engage with politics? Beyond voting for representatives, several parties in Europe have been inviting supporters to go online and vote on issues such as leadership and policy stances. Known as technopopulism, this trend is particularly central to two emergent populist movements: Italy&#x2019;s Movimento Cinque Stelle and Spain&#x2019;s Podemos. Similar to how online &#x2018;fake news&#x2019; has been changing the way the public understands current events, online-based direct democracy has already begun changing the way the public engages with political processes such as lawmaking and selecting candidates. While the rhetoric of technopopulist parties frequently highlights their usage of direct democracy as proof that they truly speak for the masses, this thesis argues that these online tools in their current iterations are problematic for reasons such as only engaging a minuscule fraction of the public and potentially obscuring undemocratic practices by party leadership.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Aim: The aim of this project was to help nurses at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Durham, North Carolina recognize and reduce horizontal violence in the workplace using an evidence-based educational session with a cognitive rehearsal technique.
      Background: Mounting evidence compiled over the last two decades has established the existence of horizontal violence in the nursing profession. Further, horizontal violence continues to be an ongoing challenge despite substantial evidence that it can negatively affect a nurse&#x2019;s quality of life and compromise patient safety. 
      Methods: VAMC staff nurses attended two educational sessions (one hour in total) of training about ways to combat horizontal violence and to learn cognitive rehearsal techniques. The first session presented the theoretical concept of horizontal violence, discussed how horizontal violence affects nurses, and included discussion of nurses&#x2019; responses to three open-ended questions. In the second educational session, participants learned about and practiced appropriate responses to the most common forms of horizontal violence through cognitive rehearsal, an interactive role-playing experience. At the end of the session, each participant was given cue cards that each stated a common form of horizontal violence and its appropriate response. A  
      follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the session to determine participants&#x2019; satisfaction with and perspectives about the educational intervention.                                            Results: Participants reported that participation in the educational session (1) increased their awareness of horizontal violence and (2) enabled them to identify at least three strategies to combat horizontal violence. Further, participants recommended that nursing colleagues would greatly benefit from the training. 
      Conclusion: This educational session targeted the negative effects of horizontal violence and used an evidenced-based cognitive rehearsal technique to increase awareness of interventions to offset negative behaviors associated with horizontal violence. Raising awareness and labeling this problem are the first steps in reducing the occurrence of horizontal violence among nurses. These initial steps establish horizontal violence as a legitimate problem and hopefully will set in motion an action plan for change at the VAMC.

          <dc:description>Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. It is important to establish
      effective treatments and prevention efforts. Progression toward these goals has been stagnant
      because it difficult to recruit representative samples of suicidal individuals in studies. By
      describing the results of recruitment efforts in a clinical trial examining the role of ovarian
      hormones in female suicidality, this study aimed to clarify the barriers to recruitment of women
      with suicidality in research. We hypothesized that barriers to recruitment would be low
      socioeconomic status, negative attitudes toward research, more severe clinical presentation, and
      minority race. We conducted t-tests and chi square analyses to compare differences in our
      expected barriers between eligible women who did enroll and eligible women who did not enroll.
      Only racial minority status was associated with lower enrollment among eligible women. Future
      research should aim to refine recruitment strategies so that samples accurately reflect an
      increasingly diverse US population.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Oral health and disease are now best understood as dysbiotic shifts in the oral microbiome, yet little is known about specific microbial-ecological events that precede the development of disease. Orthodontic treatment is an elective dental procedure known to be a risk-increasing intervention for dental caries and periodontal disease. In this pilot study, we used next-generation sequencing methods to characterize longitudinal metagenomic changes in the supragingival microbiome of adolescents undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. Methods: The study cohort comprised 10 healthy orthodontic patients (aged 13-15) scheduled for treatment with fixed appliances. One trained and calibrated examiner recorded clinical measures of bleeding on probing, gingival index, and plaque index. Supragingival plaque samples were collected from facial surfaces of maxillary incisor and mandibular premolar index teeth using sterile curettes at four-time points: before bonding of orthodontic appliances and at 1, 6, and 12 weeks after bonding. Samples were placed in sterile buffer solution and snap-frozen until analysis. DNA was isolated using a QIAamp  Microbiome Kit and a 16S rRNA amplicon library was prepared to carry out pair-ended, 150bp Illumina sequencing. After bioinformatics processing using the QIIME pipeline, microbial diversity was determined by PD Whole Tree and Shannon diversity indices, and significant differences between ethnic groups determined by Kruskal-Wallis tests.  Results: We obtained 3.6 million high-quality reads across all time points that identified 98 genera and 216 species. Biofilm diversity decreased (phylogenetic diversity, whole tree, Shannon index) from baseline (pre-treatment) to one week (post-treatment). This ecological shift was primarily due to a 73% relative decrease in Corynebacterium matruchotii and relative increases in Actinobacteria: Lautropia Mirabilis (109%) and Veillonella (27%). By 12 weeks, diversity had regressed to nearly baseline levels.  Conclusions: These results provide initial proof-of-principle that an elective oral disease risk-increasing intervention, fixed orthodontic appliances, can induce a dysbiotic shift in the supragingival oral biofilm of healthy patients.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>DESIGN OF BIOMIMETICALLY INSPIRED HYDROXYAPATITE-GELATIN BASED COMPOSITE FOR BONE SCAFFOLD APPLICATION</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Bone tissue engineering (BTE) requires a sturdy biomimetic scaffold for restoration of large bone defects. This dissertation describes the progress made in improving our previously developed Gemosil composite consisting of Hydroxyapatite-Gelatin (HAp-Gel) with silane cross-linker as a potential scaffold. Our initial goal was to further improve the mechanical strength of the composite. We first successfully doubled the mechanical strength of the composite through adding selected co-solvent during the sol-gel process. We further experimentally confirmed that the improvement of the mechanical strength is due to the improved morphology of both the silane network and the Gemosil composite. Unfortunately, the scaffold fabricated from this composite (even with the newly optimized processing condition) underwent rapid degradation in water, and rapidly lost its mechanical strength. 
      To mitigate this degradation issue, we attempted to incorporate a cross-linkable polymer into the Gemosil composite, aiming to further increase mechanical strength of the Gemosil composite with an additional polymeric network (i.e., reinforcing network). Specifically, we synthesized a new biocompatible and biodegradable copolymer, poly(L-lactide-co-propargyl carbonate) with pendent catechol functional groups. These catechol functional groups served as &#x201C;liaison&#x201D; molecules to help to improve the interfacial adhesion between the polymer network and the various components of the Gemosil. We demonstrated that through incorporating this copolymer together with mussel-inspired dopamine into Gemosil system, the compressive strength of the scaffold could be improved by 20% under aqueous condition.
      Finally, despite the impressive adhesive and coating property of dopamine/polydopamine demonstrated by us and others, polydopamine (PDA) has its own limitations. For instance, PDA&#x2019;s black color is not favored for clinical applications and its polymerization mechanism is still elusive. We synthesized a series of dopamine analogues with different alkyl chain lengths between the catechol and the amine. We found all of these new dopamine analogues were able to polymerize. Through studying the adhesive and coating ability of these new dopamine analogues, together with systems having catechol and selected alkyl amines (unbound to catechol), we showed that the covalent linkage between the catechol and the amine via an alkyl chain is not required to show the adhesive property; however, this covalent link is crucial to achieve the impressive coating property of dopamine and its analogs. Our findings offer new insights in designing mussel-inspired materials for future BTE application, and further mechanistic understanding of the polymerization of dopamine and these new dopamine analogues.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>CANNABIS USE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH: AN INVESTIGATION OF TIME TRENDS AND ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among men and women of reproductive age in the United States (U.S.) [2-4].  The adverse and beneficial health effects of cannabis use are widely debated, but recent evidence suggests that cannabis use may have negative effects on reproductive health [5-7]. Despite changing policies and attitudes, little is known about how patterns of cannabis use are changing among populations of reproductive age, or about how cannabis use might affect fetal development. 
      Understanding how trends change over time requires careful consideration of underlying demographic factors, such as age effects, generational effects, and period effects due to significant events such as legalization. Therefore, our first objective is to estimate age, period, and cohort effects of past-month cannabis use among populations of reproductive age in the U.S. from 2002-2014 using the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH, n=534,679). As policies and patterns of cannabis use continue to change, the reproductive health effects are increasingly important to understand. Animal and human studies show that cannabis affects sperm quality and may alter DNA packaging, but potential effects on fetal development are unknown. Therefore, our second objective is to estimate the effect of paternal preconception cannabis use on risk of structural birth defects in the National Birth Defects and Prevention Study (NBDPS, n=34,320). 
      Past-month cannabis use among U.S. populations of reproductive age increased from 9.2% in 2002 to 12.3% in 2014. Distinct age, period, and cohort effects were observed, though age effects were largest in magnitude. Compared to participants ages 35-49, participants ages 18-21 (PR: 2.91, 95% CI: 2.57, 3.30) and 22-25 (PR: 2.28, 95% CI: 2.03, 2.57 had higher prevalence of past-month cannabis use. In the NBDPS, cannabis use during the 3-month preconception period was reported for 8.8% of control-fathers. After adjustment for confounders, paternal cannabis use was significantly associated with gastroschisis (aOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.52), and meaningfully associated with diaphragmatic hernia (aOR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.80), cleft lip alone (aOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.60), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aOR: 1.38, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.92). 
      Past-month cannabis use is prevalent and increasing among men and women of reproductive age. While distinct age, period, and cohort effects are at play, age remains the strongest correlate of past-month cannabis use in this population, especially among 18-25 year olds. Moreover, our results are consistent with increased risk of some structural birth defects following paternal cannabis use during the preconception period. Future research is needed to understand how paternal cannabis use affects fetal development, especially in light of changing cannabis policies and documented increases in prevalence of use.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Zhenkun Guo: Application of Diffractive Optical Element on Spectroscopy and Imaging 
      (Under the direction of Andrew Moran)
      Diffractive optical elements (DOE) are optical components that manipulate light by diffraction, interference, and other phase control methods. The application of DOE in multi-dimensional spectroscopy could significantly reduce the efforts required for conducting experiments and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio with high efficiency. In this dissertation, DOE-based two-dimensional resonance Raman spectroscopy was developed and implemented in two model systems, triiodide and myoglobin. This new technique uncovers new dimensions of information, which were not available with previous one-dimensional spectroscopy techniques. The DOE was also applied to the wide-field transient absorption microscopy. Conducting a large number of experiments simultaneously is possible in this configuration. Analysis of parallel measurements provides statistical information essential to comprehensively study heterogeneous samples.
      After absorbing an ultraviolet photon, triiodide undergoes photodissociation to produce diiodide and radical iodine on a time scale comparable to the period of triiodide&#x2019;s nuclear motion, which could impulsively activate a vibrational coherence in the diiodide. In this dissertation, the ability of 2DRR to capture coherent reaction mechanisms is demonstrated by directly establishing a correlation, for the first time, between the nonequilibrium geometry of triiodide at photodissociation and the stretching frequency of diiodide.
      Ligand binding and dissociation processes are crucial to the functions of heme proteins. The recovery of the protein matrix involves fast energy dissipation from the heme group to solvent, facilitated by the propionic acid side chains as an effective &#x201C;gateway&#x201D;. In this dissertation, we found that the propionic chains possess significant structural heterogeneity, which could be induced by the thermal fluctuation in geometries. It is interesting to consider whether the variation in conformation could relate to the vibrational cooling rate distributions.
      Carrier diffusion is imaged in a perovskite film and crystal using a newly developed DOE-based wide-field transient absorption microscopy technique. The function of the instrument is illustrated with 41 parallel measurements conducted on methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films and single crystals in a single experiment. Obvious carrier diffusion is observed in the crystal. However, results indicate that the carrier dynamics in the film are dominated by many-body interactions instead. The grain boundaries in the film contribute to this difference in behavior.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Sexual Experiences and Health Outcomes from Adolescence to Early Adulthood in Populations with Physical Disabilities</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Although a large amount of research over the last half century has focused on changes in adolescent sexual behavior, relatively little is known about what characterizes optimal sexual development through the life course. Populations with disabilities have been particularly understudied for various reasons, including historical restrictions on sexual behaviors for eugenic purposes and unfounded assumptions of asexuality or hypersexuality. Past research shows that adolescents with disabilities have less sexual knowledge than non-disabled peers, are at increased risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections or diseases (STI/STD), and are more vulnerable to sexual violence and abuse, indicating a need for more information to protect this population. It is therefore crucial to understand sexual patterns and health outcomes of populations with disabilities in order to develop better support for sexual health.
      Accordingly, this dissertation used the Life Course perspective to understand longitudinal patterns of sexual development in populations with physical disabilities in the United States (U.S.) from adolescence into adulthood. I used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to: 1) identify sexual patterns of people with physical disabilities from adolescence to adulthood, and 2) determine health outcomes associated with these sexual patterns.
      Results demonstrate significant differences in sexual patterns and health outcomes for populations with physical disabilities through adulthood. Regarding sexual patterns, populations with severe disabilities progressed more slowly to first vaginal sex, oral sex, and first sexual experience, and had fewer lifetime sexual partners compared to non-disabled peers. In general, earlier timing and more sexual partners were associated with greater odds of STI/STDs and unintended pregnancy, and lower romantic relationship quality in adulthood. Associations also varied by biological sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Most notably, female and Non-Hispanic (NH) Black populations with mild disabilities were more likely to experience negative sexual health outcomes.
      These results fill gaps in the literature by providing important information regarding sexual patterns and health outcomes in this notably understudied population. Such evidence can inform future research, practice, and policies that support understanding, healthy sexual development, and the provision of more focused sexuality education to populations with physical disabilities.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Brand Trust is defined as the &#x201C;willingness of the average consumer to rely on the ability of the brand to perform its stated function&#x201D; (Chaudhuri and Holbrook 2001, p. 82). Trust plays a key role in brand success by lowering customers&#x2019; purchase risk and easing their decision making. Despite the importance of brand trust, industry reports indicate alarming decline in consumer trust in brands across the world. For example, Young &amp; Rubicam (2011) reported that the percentage of brands that customers trusted dropped from 49% in 2001 to 25% in 2010. In the meantime, despite growing managerial interest in brand trust, marketing literature lacks generalizable insights regarding antecedents and consequences of brand trust. Specifically, there is need for research to investigate the impact of marketing activities on brand trust, the implications and consequences of brand trust (and violation of brand trust), and the characteristics that explain the heterogeneity in relationships between brand trust and related concepts. I address these issues in three studies.
      In the first study, I examine the relationship between five marketing mix instruments (advertising, new product introduction, distribution, price, price promotion) and brand trust. Using a unique dataset that combines consumer surveys and scanner panel data on 589 leading national brands in 46 CPG categories across 13 countries, I also examine category and country level characteristics that moderate the relationships between marketing mix activities and brand trust. In the second study of this dissertation, I examine the dynamics of the most important consequence of brand trust &#x2013; i.e., brand equity &#x2013; and the impact of economic business cycles on brand equity. Moreover, I study category and brand level moderators that safeguard brand equity against macroeconomic fluctuations. In doing so, I use monthly data on 150 leading CPG brands in 36 categories across 17 years. In the final study, I investigate violation of brand trust. In doing so, I examine 143 product recalls in 12 European countries and focus on the impact of price promotions. Additionally, I study recall, category, and country level characteristics that explain the heterogeneity in post-recall performance and price promotion effectiveness.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Terrestrial landscape alterations cause changes along the coast, where rivers deliver sediments to estuaries and oceans. In contrast to major rivers, tidal creek watersheds are small, but they are numerous and drain much of the eastern United States&#x2019; coastal-estuarine land area. Coastal watersheds are frequently hotspots of development, and in North Carolina, residents have expressed concerns about creeks infilling, becoming unnavigable for boaters and uninhabitable for fish. To understand the relationship between land-use change and creek infilling, sedimentation rates calculated from 210Pb in cores from twelve tidal creeks across North Carolina were compared to changes in watershed land use 1959-2010. Results indicate that land-use change, particularly increasing non-agricultural development, has the potential to drive infilling of tidal creeks, although hydrological conditions impose some limits and are responsible for the partitioning of increased sediment loads between deposition in creeks and export to larger estuaries.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Drawing upon American newspaper sources from the 1770s-1790s, this paper examines the role of neoclassical discourse in the development of a national political culture in the early United States.  Despite its highly aristocratic origins in the Glorious Revolution of England, the neoclassicism of the American Revolution became a versatile and creative mode of political expression available to those outside of the political elite.  During and after the American Revolution, political elites turned to classical antiquity as a source of moral authority, distinguishing the new American Republic from Britain while styling themselves after British aristocrats and affirming their role as the Republic&#x2019;s natural leaders.  Non-elites also absorbed this neoclassical ethos, especially through Patriot propaganda, ultimately adopting it for their own ends.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Process Design for Scalable Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The versatility of recombinant adeno-associated viruses has garnered significant attention from investors, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies as more therapies using this vector are finding success in preclinical and late-stage clinical trials, even some reaching the market approval stage in the US. A number of vector production methods have been developed to generate the necessary clinical grade vectors that have high potency, and have high-titers to reduce general manufacturing and therapeutic costs. However, each of these production methods inherently have their own drawbacks, whether it is the concomitantly produced helper vectors used to make the AAV or the quality of the AAV itself. We previously developed a HEK293-cell based producer cell line method for high titer and high potency rAAV vectors. However, this method requires significant time-intensive generation of novel producer cell lines for every rAAV vector of interest and furthermore the E1-, E3-deleted adenovirus is only occupied at the E1-region, leaving the space available in the E3-region unused. In this body of work, we discuss a novel adenovirus construct that utilizes a packaging cell line to generate a high titer and high quality rAAV, and attempts to remove the accompanying adenovirus in the final product batch. The improvements made in this system are: 1) the development of a one-step cloning of a rAAV vector cassette into the E1-region of the adenovirus, 2) use of an efficiently generated packaging cell line to universally package the rAAV vector provided in trans by the adenovirus, 3) high vector yields on different rAAV inverted terminal repeat designs provided by the adenovirus, and 4) high quality, low. empty-particle containing rAAV product. We attempt to remove contaminating entities in the rAAV production method, using a selective precipitating agent called domiphen bromide. Although this detergent is efficient in removing contaminating materials such as DNA and adenovirus, there are major difficulties to reduce interactions with certain serotypes of AAV. Therefore, an alternative method for removing adenovirus is necessary, possibly by high hydrostatic pressure or nanofilters. The simple adenovirus construct coupled with the packaging cell line can be a pivotal method for large scale AAV vector production.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Legal Fictions, Literary Narrative, and the Historical Truth: The Jurisprudence of Marriage in the Long Eighteenth Century</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation explores the impact of legal and literary fictions about marriage on the modern historical consciousness. By reading the early English novel in conjunction with contemporary legal texts on marriage&#x2014;parliamentary acts and debates, case law, marriage settlements, and private separation deeds&#x2014;I demonstrate that eighteenth-century English marriage law and practice was constituted through a variety of conflicting legal fictions. I further demonstrate that the early novel was preoccupied with how those fictions shaped the lived experience of domesticity, particularly for women. The fictional precepts and presumptions underwriting emerging contract theory and traditional marriage doctrine at once directed and circumscribed (proto)modern developments in marriage, property, and divorce law. Moreover, the novel, in its mimetic and ideological capacities, variously worked to expose, advance, and revise those fictions, thereby amplifying and altering their historical force. Examining the dialectical relationship between legal texts and the novels of Daniel Defoe, Eliza Haywood, Samuel Richardson, Frances Burney, Charlotte Smith, Elizabeth Inchbald, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Jane Austen, this project challenges traditional conceptions of the law as stable, objective, and truth-bearing, and it demonstrates the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to historical inquiry. The project also highlights the need for renewed attention to the concept of &#x201C;legal fiction,&#x201D; including its influence on the modern individual&#x2019;s perceptions of self and other, masculinity and femininity, and legal rights and moral duties. 
      Each chapter explores the legal fictions implicated at a particular stage in the marriage contracting process. Chapter one, on marriage formation, focuses on the principles of the then-emerging theory of contract development. Chapter two, on marital unification, centers on the classic legal fiction of &#x201C;unity of person.&#x201D; Chapter three, on marital dissolution, addresses the foundational assumptions of the indissolubility doctrine, as well as the presumption of &#x201C;paternal right&#x201D; and the fiction of illegitimacy, filius nullius. Collectively, these chapters chart the entire trajectory of marriage, from start to finish.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Vienna-based artist Gebhard Sengm&#xFC;ller's 1990s multimedia installation TV Poetry represented a critical and constructive response to television's influence in the late twentieth century, aligning it with a dialectical construction of electronic media in Marxist media theory. The work falls within art historical, literary, and technological lineages of systems, media, and telecommunications art. In its reconfiguration of television's discursive codes and its incorporation of networked engagement, TV Poetry represented an ambivalent acknowledgement of the relationship between cultural consumption and attention, and the potential of software to disrupt the one-way transmissions of broadcast television. The second version of TV Poetry more explicitly engaged a context of communicational borderlessness and growing possibilities for newer media to reconfigure power relations via its simultaneous emphasis on and collapsing of the distances between information transmission and reception, and its disruption of experiences of time and place, real and virtual, watching and reading, and creation and consumption.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Survey of Suicide Prevention for Resident Advisors at a State University: The Impact of Training on Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceived Competency, Perceived Role Responsibility, and Intervention Behavior</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Suicide is the tenth ranking cause of death in the United States (CDC, 2015); however, alarmingly, suicide is the second leading cause of death in the fifteen to twenty-four age group (CDC, 2015).  Drum et al. (2009) surveyed undergraduate students (n = 15,010) from seventy U.S. colleges and universities.  The researchers found that in one year, 6% of the students (n = 910) seriously considered suicide (Drum et al., 2009).  There is a growing body of research on suicide prevention trainings for resident advisors (RA) on college campuses, but there is no standardized training curriculum and each university goes about training their RAs differently (Parries, 2014).
      This study used a quantitative design to explore the role of resident advisors as suicide prevention gatekeepers on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) campus. The study assessed RAs&#x2019; suicide-related knowledge, attitudes toward suicide and mental health treatment, perceived role responsibility in terms of suicide prevention, perceived competency to handle situations concerning suicide, and suicide-specific intervention behaviors.  This information was gathered through three surveys: one before the summer UNC-CH RA training, one three days after the training, and one three months after the training.
      Results of the study showed that number of years served as RAs does not significantly influence their suicide prevention intervention behavior count.  On the other hand, gender does significantly affect RAs&#x2019; attitude toward suicide prevention and mental health treatment.  Results also showed that, over the course of the semester, RAs&#x2019; attitudes toward suicide, their suicide-related knowledge, how competent they feel responding to suicide-related situations, and their intervention behaviors increased.  Both perceived competency and intervention behaviors increased significantly.  A predictive analysis showed that knowledge, competency, attitude, and role responsibility predicted intervention behavior.  Attitude best explained intervention behavior whereas, responsibility was least likely to explain it.  Overall, the results of the study support the continued need for a suicide-prevention curriculum as a part of RA training.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>IMPLEMENTING ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP IN THE PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Antibiotic resistance, an increasing threat in healthcare, is driven by the misuse of antibiotics. It is critical to follow clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis and management of infections, so that antibiotics are used only when appropriate. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common pediatric infections and effective management requires appropriate diagnostic methods and treatment. The literature suggests that there is variation in practice with specimen collection for pediatric emergency department patients when UTI is suspected. Furthermore, there is a wide variation in treatment with broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics (Copp, Yiee, Smith, Hanley, &amp; Saigal, 2013; Coutinho, Stensland, Akhavan, Jaydevan, &amp; Stock, 2014; Selekman, Allen, &amp; Copp, 2016; Percival et al., 2015). The pediatric emergency department at UNC Hospitals did not have a standard protocol for the diagnostic testing or treatment of uncomplicated UTI. There was an opportunity to improve practice at the pediatric emergency department by standardizing uncomplicated UTI diagnostic testing and treatment according to local bacterial resistance patterns. Using quality improvement methodologies and the Lewin Change Theory, an evidence-based standardized clinical decision support algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated pediatric UTI was implemented at UNC Hospitals Pediatric Emergency Department for patients ages 3 months to 12 years with suspected UTI.  During the QI project, 458 children were assessed for UTI and 75 children diagnosed with UTI. The QI project resulted in sustained improvements in provider adherence to: correctly ordered specimens, correct management of positive urinalysis results and use of recommended antibiotics. Balancing measures showed no significant differences between pre- and post-intervention periods.This project has shown that the implementation of a simple, low-cost evidence-based algorithm, can be effective for improving provider adherence to antibiotic stewardship efforts, especially when tailored to a specific department or unit&#x2019;s workflow. This is the first QI project to both address standardization of specimen collection and treatment for pediatric UTI in the emergency department setting and our findings suggest this can be done with no adverse outcomes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>IMPROVING STAFF COMFORT WITH AND DELIVERY OF BEHAVIORAL COUNSELING INTERVENTIONS TO ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT MALES PRESENTING FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION SCREENING</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: More than two-thirds of sexually transmitted infections (STI) occur in Americans under age 25. There are nearly 20 million new STIs each year and this number is increasing.  Several organizations recommend including STI screening and behavioral counseling in every adolescent health appointment to reduce STI risk. However, adolescents and young adults (AYA), particularly males, do not consistently receive this care. This project aimed to improve the frequency and quality of behavioral counseling delivered to AYA males at a Health Department in North Carolina through development of an evidence-based staff workshop.
      Methods: This project was developed using quality improvement methodology. A chart review was completed of AYA males who presented for STI screening during a three-month period. These data were used to design the workshop. Attendees were asked to complete one pre- and two post-surveys to assess their perceptions of this curriculum. An additional chart review was completed after the workshop to assess for changes in staff documentation of behavioral counseling interventions delivered to AYA males presenting for STI screening in the 11 weeks after the workshop.
      Results: The initial chart audit highlighted potential areas for future staff training, including improving documentation practices, distribution of free condoms, and alcohol consumption classification. Overall, staff survey responses were positive and suggested that staff were receptive to incorporating behavioral counseling into patient encounters. After the workshop, there was a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of patients with documentation on their condom use (z = -2.64, p = 0.0042, one-tailed) and in the proportion of patients who were offered free condoms &#x3C7;2 (2, N = 52) = 11.27, p = .004; (z = -2.64, p = 0.0042, one-tailed). There was also a significant decrease in the proportion of patients who had an unclassifiable alcohol consumption level  &#x3C7;2 (4, N = 39) = 17.29, p = .002; (z= 3.33, p= 0.00043, one-tailed). 
      Conclusions: Healthcare professionals should receive training as this has been demonstrated to improve the effectiveness of behavioral counseling. Importantly, this project suggests that HCPs are receptive to receiving training and that such training may improve the delivery of STI risk reducing interventions.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Political preferences and behavior are rooted in psychological traits. Locus of control theory describes in terms of internality or externality whether individuals believe they exercise a lot of influence over events in their lives, or whether they attribute such events to outside forces such as luck, fate, or some authority. I applied this theory to political science to explore whether this construct can predict authoritarian preference. I focused on Russia and hypothesized that Russians may be more predisposed toward an external locus of control and preference for authoritarianism than are citizens of liberal democracies. I use Pew Research Center&#x2019;s Spring 2011 Survey data to test effects of locus of control on authoritarian preference, controlling for country and for economic strength preference. Preference for a strong economy most strongly correlates with preference for a strong-hand leader, but I also find a significant effect of locus of control and country on authoritarian preference.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>GENERATION OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT MODELS OF BURN-ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES FOR ANALYSIS OF IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION AFTER BURN INJURY</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Burn injury is a significant form of trauma that leads to alterations in the functionality of multiple body systems. One vital system that promotes both healing and protection from invasive pathogens is the immune system. After burn injury the immune system is severely impeded. However, models of burn injury are unable to successfully recapitulate phenotypes seen among burn-injured patient populations. Studies indicate that presence of burn-associated comorbidities can greatly improve the translatability of models and that study of comorbidities is essential for improving treatment of patients.
      Here we report the development of a model of repeated bacterial exposure after burn injury. This model is able to recapitulate immune cell recruitment and alterations in cytokine production that mimic those seen among patient populations. Namely, we found that repeated infections lead to increased bacterial burden after burn injury, and the loss of a lab-derived burn &#x201C;protection&#x201D; phenotype that is common in the literature late after burn injury. We found that this phenotype corresponds with burn-dependent alterations in pulmonary innate immune cell numbers and function. We believe that these cells represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
      Additionally, we have worked to establish a model of inhalation injury to examine inhalation-dependent alterations in the immune profile that take place both independently and concomitant with burn injury. We have found that inhalation and burn injury independently contribute to damage in our murine model of inhalation. We examined the pulmonary compartment and found that burn and inhalation independently affect the recruitment of neutrophils to either the airspace or the lung tissue. We also found that inhibition of nitric oxide production can ameliorate damage that takes place after inhalation injury, representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention among the patient population.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>ESSAYS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND URBAN FORM</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation includes three self-contained and interrelated papers on climate change mitigation, building energy efficiency, and urban form.
      Paper 1: Urban form and household electricity consumption: a multilevel study
      While urban form affects building energy consumption, the pathways, direction and magnitude of the effect are disputed in the literature. This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the effect of urban form on residential electricity consumption in Ningbo, China. Using survey and utility bill data of 534 households in 46 neighborhoods in the city, I model the electricity use of households using a multi-level regression model. I find that neighborhood street configuration and tree shade are important in controlling residential electricity consumption and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions. The results suggest that seasonality and dwelling type condition the effect of neighborhood densities on electricity consumption. Neighborhood density is associated with household electricity consumption in summer months, while there is no such association in the winter months. As neighborhood density increases, households in slab and tower apartments in dense urban neighborhoods consume more electricity in summer months, which can be partly explained by exacerbated heat island effect. Interestingly, the neighborhood density is negatively associated with electricity consumption for single-family houses, suggesting that the effect of neighborhood density is different for different types of dwelling units. 
      Paper 2: Explaining spatial variations in residential energy usage intensity in Chicago: the role of urban form and geomorphometry
      Understanding the spatial pattern of energy consumption within buildings is essential to urban energy planning and management. In this study, I explore the spatial complexity of residential energy usage intensity, with a focus on urban form and the geomorphometry attributes of urban ventilation, solar insolation, and vegetation. I use building energy use data in Chicago at a Census tract level and merge information from various datasets including parcel attributes, three-dimensional data geometry, aerial imagery, and Census. Using spatial regression models, I find that while vegetation has more local impact on energy intensity, urban porosity and roughness length have consistent spillover effects on building electricity usage intensity in Chicago. Additionally, these relationships are seasonally varied: while vegetation, ventilation, and insolation affect electricity usage in summer, they have no impact on the winter gas consumption. The results highlight the importance of spatially explicit policies and clear urban design and form frameworks for reducing urban energy consumption and mitigating climate change.
      Paper 3: Government response to climate change in China: a study of first-generation provincial and municipal plans
      In this paper, I provide an overview of the first-generation local and regional climate change plans in China by scrutinizing planning documents of 16 cities, four autonomous regions, and 22 provinces. I develop and apply an evaluation protocol to understand goals, process, and strategies in these plans. The results indicate that provincial and local plans include numerous policies and strategies, yet some important types of local policies, such as land use and urban form, are not well identified in the plans. The results also indicate that current climate change planning in China is characterized by the &#x201C;top-down&#x201D; approach, in which the central governmental incentives play a vital role in shaping provincial and municipal plans. In addition, most plans have the following issues: vague definition of what characterizes a low carbon city/region, deficiency in the quality of GHG inventory and reduction targets, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and weak horizontal coordination. Finally, I offer recommendations to improve climate change planning in China.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Throughout the Metamorphoses, Ovid employs the verb satiare programmatically, linking sex, eating, and bloodshed in a web of associations surrounding the goddesses Juno and Diana as they punish mortals. Ovid twists satiare&#x2019;s poetic etymology from Vergil&#x2019;s Aeneid, which portrays Juno as insatiable for revenge, employing it instead with reference to Diana to show how the virgin goddess can be satiated with extreme bloodshed. He also foregrounds these goddesses&#x2019; sexual motivations to highlight the ironies implicit in Juno&#x2019;s role as the goddess of marriage and childbirth and in the virginal Diana&#x2019;s satisfaction in gory revenge. The other appearances of satiare, in reference to Cephalus and Erychsithon, connect these men with the unpredictable female ira that satiare describes in the rest of the poem. The web of unsettling and violent associations between these goddesses and satiare evokes the inherent Greekness of the mythology that Ovid is drawing on.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Ashley Elizabeth Mason: Mealtime Experiences and Activities: An Ethnography from the Children&#x2019;s Perspective
      (Under the direction of Ruth Humphry)
      This dissertation reports findings from a 9-month collaborative ethnographic study of children&#x2019;s mealtime experiences and activities in two different settings. Methods included conversations and interviews, participant observation, photo elicitation and drawings or collages to explore the children&#x2019;s mealtime experiences and activities and their meanings at school and home. I used the transactional perspective and Vygotsky&#x2019;s activity theory to view children&#x2019;s experiences of mealtime activity in both settings. The children&#x2019;s perspective about their mealtime activities and experiences was highlighted in the findings as they navigated the complexity and situational nature of mealtime activities daily. The children underlined three main focal points: (1) social interaction is essential to mealtime; (2) meals are complex, situationally-based moments imbued with sites of social learning; and finally, (3) boundaries are tested and pressed through exercising agency while engaging with others during mealtime. 
      I suggest the following as implications for occupational science: the need to explore more occupations in-depth from populations other than the White middle-class adult female; the importance of inviting children to become more active and ascertain more power in the  
      research process; and the importance of framing children&#x2019;s mealtime practices as a social endeavor through which &#x2018;appropriate&#x2019; behaviors and actions are observed, learned, and practiced over time through a variety of environments. Future lines of research are related to examining mealtime practices in other child populations and exploring other child occupations closely.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper examines the ideological content and implications of texts from Britain and North America translated and published in France during the American Revolution and situates them in political dialogues already underway in the French public sphere by the 1770s. Focused on popular sovereignty, representation in government, and public control of state finances, the paper shows how documents from America and Britain reinforced radical political arguments in France that would ultimately undermine the absolutist old regime. These texts, circulated legally in newspapers and the state-run periodical Affaires de l&#x2019;Angleterre et de l&#x2019;Am&#xE9;rique, communicated numerous arguments in favor of populism and public action to French readers. This thesis places those texts into the cannon of subversive writings that circulated in the French public sphere in the years before the revolution, and thus places the American Revolution into the narrative of the buildup to France&#x2019;s own political upheaval in 1789.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>We formulate a conjecture which interprets DAHA superpolynomials colored by fundamental weights to the Borel-Moore cohomology of Jacobian factors and their flagged and higher rank generalizations. To study the generalized Jacobian factors we use a certain stratification derived from the valuation semi-group of the singularity and in special cases show that the components of the stratification of the flagged Jacobian factors and higher rank Jacobian factors are affine spaces. Once these results are in place it is easy to check the main conjecture. In the last section, we are able to check the conjecture for more sophisticated examples where the stratification does not consist of affine cells and study for a particular example which types of varieties may occur as components in the stratification.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The mandates of federal and state education policies require educational leaders at all levels to select and implement research-based strategies to increase student achievement levels for all students. &#x201C;Looping, a term coined by Jim Grant, author of the &#x2018;Looping Handbook&#x2019; refers to the not-so-new but increasingly common practice of keeping groups students together for two or more years with the same teacher&#x201D; (Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Lab. at Brown Univ., 1997, p.3). The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate the relationship between student assignments to a classroom practicing looping and student achievement on the state&#x2019;s End-of-Grade (EOG) exam in an elementary school setting. The students&#x2019; achievement levels on the third and fourth grade EOG exams were used to determine if the assignment to a looping classroom had a statistically significant impact on student achievement. The comparison focused on disaggregated student subgroups to examine the relationship between the assignment to a looped classroom and the narrowing of the persistent achievement gap between minority students and their Caucasian counterparts. In addition, this study investigated how teachers and administrators practicing looping perceive the impact of looping on student achievement. 
          The results of the quantitative portion of this study revealed that students&#x2019; assignment to a classroom that practiced looping did not have a statistically significant impact on overall student achievement nor did looping narrow the achievement gap. The results did indicate that assignment to a looping classroom positively impacted mathematical achievement levels for students in the African American subgroup but did not have a statistically significant impact for any other student subgroup. The qualitative portion of this study consisted of semi-structured interviews with the teachers and administrator engaged in looping to provide context and descriptive data. The findings indicated that the teachers and administrators feel that looping is a positive experience for some students and had the potential to positively impact student achievement but is not a positive experience for all students. Overall, the teachers and administrator found looping positively impacted relationships but had limited impact on achievement levels.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The academic library middle manager (ALMM) role is little understood and understudied. Using Organizational Role Theory, Middle Managers&#x2019; Four Strategic Roles, and the Taxonomy of Managerial Performance Requirements as frameworks, this study was designed to identify and describe the expectations of the middle manager role in academic libraries; to discover the extent to which members of the middle manager&#xE2;s role set agree about the expectations of the role; to learn the activities and behaviors ALMMs actually perform; to discover how employees learn the role; to learn to what extent AALMs experience role conflict, role ambiguity, and turnover intentions; and the extent to which ALMMs participate in strategic activities. This multiple case study utilized multiple perspective interviews, observations, questionnaires, and document analysis to gather data from 41 library employees across three academic libraries in order to create a bricolage of ALMM role set members&#x2019; perceptions, expectations, activities, and behaviors. Based on the degree to which employees&#x2019; expressed expectations overlapped (expectations consensus), participants expect ALMMs to communicate effectively, maintain technical proficiency, maintain good working relationships, and coordinate subordinates. But ALMMs also received a wide variety of expectations from their role set members and organizational documents, making them vulnerable to role conflict and role ambiguity. ALMMs also performed many activities that were not expressed as role set member expectations. Library employees learned the ALMM role through social interplay and learning rather through organizational documents or formal training. ALMMs in new positions and those subject to significant organizational change experience greater role ambiguity, while ALMMs who participate in strategic activities experience less role ambiguity. Findings support a further critique of ALMM preparation and training, including LIS education.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANETS AND STELLAR SYSTEMS WITH NEW ROBOTS</dc:title>
          <dc:date>2018-01-01T05:00:00Z</dc:date>

          <dc:description>Large astronomical surveys find thousands of interesting transient events, such as exoplanets. Beyond detection, these surveys are limited in their ability to study the properties of these discoveries. In particular, a common problem with wide-field surveys is because they observe huge swaths of the sky, their resolution is often quite coarse, leading to source confusion and photometric contamination. In this dissertation, I discuss the use of robotic, high-resolution instruments to confirm and characterize exoplanets and also better understand the demographics of stellar populations. These surveys are only feasible with autonomous instruments due to the order-of-magnitude increase in observational time efficiency gained with automation.
      I present first the design and construction of Robo-SOAR, a moderate-order NGS-AO system in development for the SOAR telescope. With robotic software adapted from Robo-AO, Robo-SOAR will be capable of observing hundreds of targets a night.  With an innovative, low-cost dual knife-edge WFS, similar in concept to a pyramid WFS but with reduced chromatic aberrations, Robo-SOAR can reach the diffraction limit on brighter targets.
      I then discuss the observations of 348 cool subdwarf stars with Robo-AO, a pilot study for future kilo-target surveys. Cool subdwarfs are remnants of the first population of stars formed in the Milky Way. I find that approximately 12% of cool subdwarfs have binary companions, a multiplicity fraction three times lower than similar dwarf stars. The disparity between the two populations may be evidence of the different environments in which they formed. The lack of companions to cool subdwarfs suggests they may have formed in less dense regions, or over their long lifetimes may have had more disruptive encounters with other stars and the Galactic tide. It is also possible that they are galactic interlopers, and formed in small, less-dense galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. We show that the disparity between cool subdwarf and red dwarf multiplicity is consistent with this scenario.
      I report the results of the Robo-AO survey of every planetary candidate discovered with Kepler to search for previously unknown nearby stars. These stars contaminate the exquisite photometry of Kepler and can either dilute the transit signal from a real planet, resulting in underestimated radii estimates, or be the source of an astrophysical false positive transit signal. More than half of the over 4000 Kepler planetary candidates have only been observed with Robo-AO. We find 610 stars within 4'' of a planetary candidate host star, and correct the derived radii estimates of the more than 800 planets within these systems. On average, we find that the planetary radii increase by a factor of approximately 1.59 in systems with a detected nearby star. We quantify the probability of association for over 150 multiple systems hosting planets using multi-band photometry. In particular, we examine five planetary candidate host stars with four nearby stars detected by Robo-AO and quantify the probability they are high-order planet-hosting systems.
      Lastly, I use the results of the Robo-AO Kepler survey to search for evidence of the impact multiple star systems have on planets. The presence of a companion star is believed to have a significant impact on the properties of planetary systems. I find that hot Jupiters are more likely than any other planet to be found in a binary star system. This suggests that stellar companions drive orbital migration of giant planets. I also find that single and multiple-transiting planet systems are equally likely to be found in a binary. I find that KOIs from later data releases are less likely to have a nearby star than systems from earlier data releases, possibly a result of the automation of the Kepler vetting pipeline. I find that KOIs follow trends observed in field stars with respect to the relationship between stellar multiplicity and stellar effective temperature and metallicity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES OF NORTH CAROLINA</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Social determinants of health (SDH) have far reaching impact on population health outcomes. SDH include income, education, transportation, housing, racism and other social factors. Research shows that they account for between 28 and 50% of health outcomes. North Carolina&#x2019;s local public health agencies are tasked with improving the public health through three core functions:  assessment, policy development and assurance. In order to determine the major health concerns of their populations, all counties complete a community health needs assessment (CHNA) and identify local health priorities. At the time of this research, only 17 of 100 counties prioritized a SDH.  
      The purpose of this dissertation was three-fold:  identify facilitators of and barriers to prioritizing and engaging in work to improve SDH by local public health agencies; identify common characteristics, circumstances, policies and practices associated with local public health agencies that are prioritizing and engaging in work to improve SDH; and a practical guide to improving prioritizing and engaging in SDH for local public health agencies.
      An electronic survey was sent to all NC local health directors. Response rate was 68%. From those respondents, four counties were identified for closer examination. Across the four counties, 15 key informants were interviewed. 
      Survey results indicated interest in SDH work by local health agencies. Local health directors rated the role of public health highest for education, environment, social connectivity and racism. The lowest rated sectors were income, housing and transportation. The primary concern around implementation was access to resources. There was no single &#x201C;type&#x201D; of North Carolina public health agency more or less likely to prioritize SDH. No matter the economic status or population density, different communities are identifying with the roles local public health agencies can or should be playing in SDH.   
      Interview results further illuminated opportunities and barriers to work in SDH. While access to resources remained a central theme, most informants referenced community connectivity and engagement as a major support for SDH work. Informants were committed to the work, but recognized that formal processes, funding and structure would improve their ability to have an impact.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Purpose: Ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) is an imaging tool used to quantify tendon structural integrity. UTC has quantified patellar tendon response to load in athletes; however, PT structure between two conversely loaded high volume sports has yet to be compared. 
      Methods: The JV Men's Basketball team (n=13) and Varsity Men's Swim team (n=13) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were imaged using the UTC device with a 10-MHz linear-array transducer mounted in a tracking device. The device captures images at 0.2mm intervals along the AT. UTC algorithms quantified the stability of pixel brightness over every 17 contiguous transverse images  into 4 echo-types (I-IV).  Participants completed a jump-landing task using the Electromagnetic Motion Capture System. The dominant limb of each participant was analyzed for patellar tendon structure and landing biomechanics. All participants completed a self-report training load questionnaire, including the validated PT assessment the VISA-P. Independent Samples T-tests, correlations and multiple linear regression model were used to assess association and correlation between tendon structure and measures of training intensity. 
      Results: 26 subjects completes this study. There was significant difference in tendon structure between basketball and swim athletes (p = 0.04) with basketball athletes presenting with significantly less aligned tendon structure. There was moderate association between training intensity and tendon structure. Discussion: Training intensity and training load may negatively influence patellar tendon structural integrity.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Acoustic phenomena have a large impact on our everyday lives, from influencing our enjoyment of music in a concert hall, to affecting our concentration at school or work, to potentially negatively impacting our health through deafening noises. The sound that reaches our ears is absorbed, reflected, and filtered by the shape, topology, and materials present in the environment. However, many computer simulation techniques for solving these sound propagation problems are either computationally expensive or inaccurate. Additionally, the costs of some methods are dramatically increased in design optimization processes in which several iterations of sound propagation evaluation are necessary.
      The primary goal of this dissertation is to present techniques for efficiently solving the sound propagation problem and related optimization problems for computer-aided design. First, we propose a parallel method for solving large acoustic propagation problems, scalable to tens of thousands of cores. Second, we present two novel techniques for optimizing certain acoustic characteristics such as reverberation time or sound clarity using wave-based sound propagation. Finally, we show how hybrid sound propagation algorithms can be used to improve the performance of acoustic optimization problems and present two algorithms for noise minimization and speech intelligibility improvement that use this hybrid approach.
      All the algorithms we present are evaluated on various benchmarks that are computer models of architectural scenes. These benchmarks include challenging environments for existing sound propagation algorithms, such as large indoor or outdoor scenes, structural complex scenes, or the prevalence of difficult-to-model sound propagation phenomena. Using the techniques put forth in this dissertation, we can solve many challenging sound propagation and optimization problems on the scenes in an efficient manner. We are able to accurately model sound propagation using wave-based approaches up to \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} (the full range of human speech) and for the full range of human hearing (22kHz) using our hybrid approach. Our noise minimization methods show improvements of up to 13dB in noise reduction on some scenes, and we show a 71\% improvement in speech intelligibility using our algorithm.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The rise of bottled water (BW) consumption is a dental public health concern. This mixed-methods study aimed to 1) identify trends and determinants of water-drinking practices among children presenting to an academic dental institution over 15 years, and 2) understand Latino community members&#x2019; experiences with fluoridated community water (CW) and views on strategies to promote its consumption.
      Analyses of electronic health record data showed that BW consumption increased from 17% in 2004 to 42% in 2016 (n=2,920, P&lt;0.05). Medicaid-enrolled children [prevalence ratio (PR)=2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.8-2.4] and those living in rural areas (PR=1.3, 95% CI=1.1-1.5) were significantly more likely to consume BW over CW than those without Medicaid and those in urban areas, respectively.
      Interviews with 15 Latino parents and key informants revealed a &#x2018;lack of knowledge about safety and fluoridation of CW&#x2019; and &#x2018;ingrained upbringings that devalued CW.&#x2019; Spanish-speaking health professionals may be promising promoters of CW consumption.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Developing a quantitative understanding of excited charge carrier dynamics at heterogeneous interfaces between semiconductor and organic molecules is of great practical importance in advanced technologically important applications. Despite great advances in this field, there remain many aspects that are yet to be understood such as the density of charge carrier, the role of defects, and the interactions with surface ligand. To this end, we aim to develop and apply a quantitative formulation based on first-principles quantum theory to elucidate how excited carrier dynamics at semiconductor-molecule interfaces depend on the atomistic details.
      In this work, we systematically investigated several aspects of excited carrier dynamics at semiconductor-molecule interfaces via first-principles quantum mechanics simulations that are synergistically combined with the fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm, G0W0 many-body perturbation theory calculations, and first-principles molecular dynamics. We conclude that hot electron transfer to chemisorbed molecules was observed but was short-lived on the molecules. Interfacial electron transfer was found to be largely decoupled from hot electron relaxation within the semiconductor. While hot electron relaxation was found to take place on a time scale of several hundred femtoseconds, the subsequent interfacial electron transfer was slower by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, this secondary process of picosecond electron transfer was found to be comparable in time scale to typical electron trapping into defect states in the energy gap.
      We then investigated how molecular details such as surface coverage and adsorbate species influence hot electron transfer. Counterintuitively, increasing surface coverage was found to suppress hot electron transfer probability because the increased delocalization of the hot electron accepting molecular states change the nonadiabatic couplings at the interface. In addition, the adsorbate species itself is an important factor in hot electron transfer not simply because of energy level alignments, but because the transfer is quite sensitive to nonadiabatic couplings.
      Finally, we examined the extent to which exchange-correlation approximations influence the interfacial charge transfer at a representative heterogeneous interface. We showed how the charge transfer kinetics are influenced by the exchange-correlation approximation through lattice movement, nonadiabatic couplings, and energy level alignments. The interfacial electron transfer time scale was found to vary by as much as, but not more than, one order of magnitude.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>HEALTH LITERACY IN TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND MEDICATION ADHERENCE: APPLICATION TO STABLE ANGINA PECTORIS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Health literacy is a major determinant of health outcomes, spending, and hospital admissions. However, gaps in the literature remain on the relationship between health literacy and health behaviors. The objective of this dissertation was to assess the relationship between health literacy and key health behaviors for patients with stable angina pectoris. The dissertation had three aims: 1) evaluate the relationship between health literacy and treatment assignment: medication only, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery; 2) assess patient and clinician behavior during treatment planning conversations; and 3) evaluate the relationship between health literacy and adherence to anti-anginal medications for stable angina. 
      We used a 20 percent Medicare claims sample from 2007-2013 to evaluate the first and third aims. Health literacy was assessed using an area-based measure. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between health literacy and treatment assignment. Probit regression, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and two-stage residual inclusion were used to assess the relationship between health literacy and medication adherence. For the second aim, we used recorded patient-clinician encounters and questionnaire data from the PCI Choice Trial. In this data source, health literacy was assessed using a validated screening question. 
      Patients living in low health literacy areas had significantly higher utilization of medication only (3.3 percentage points) and lower utilization of CABG (-3.0 percentage points) compared to patients in high health literacy areas. This finding may be related to health literacy being a predictor of worse access to care. Low literacy was associated with greater decisional conflict among patients and may be a barrier in communication. The clinician and the setting in which the conversation took place may also be important determinants of communication quality. Low health literacy may act as barrier to patient-clinician communication. Living in low health literacy areas was also associated with significantly lower medication adherence when using the quartile specification of health literacy (-2.8 percentage points), but not the dichotomous specification. There was also strong evidence for selection into treatment assignment. The small magnitude of these findings do not support the use of health literacy to inform interventions to improve medication adherence.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Researchers modified the Spector Job Satisfaction Survey to determine job satisfaction of millennial graduate assistant (GA) football coaches at the Division I-FBS level and gauge role conflict. Researchers analyzed satisfaction using descriptive statistics software. Millennial GAs were overall satisfied with their jobs, but least satisfied with their pay. A leading number of millennial GAs found being able to coach football most rewarding about their job (31%). Ninety-three percent of GAs reported that obtaining a Master&#x2019;s degree was important. Only 61% believed they could complete their graduate program. This research suggests the NCAA and membership institution administrators should review its compensation and educational policies to ensure GAs are compensated and protected in their roles as both a student and a coach.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Sarah E. W. Croop: Implementation of a Golden Hour Protocol for Extremely Premature Infants
      (Under the direction of Suzanne Thoyre)
              Extremely premature (EP) infants are fragile, susceptible to rapidly developing hypothermia and hypoglycemia, and face substantial risk of long-term morbidity and mortality. Golden Hour protocols (GHP) bundle and standardize evidence-based practices for care of these vulnerable infants during the first 60 minutes of life and are reported to decrease short-term and potentially decrease long-term morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the study was to examine short- and long-term outcomes in EP infants following implementation of a GHP in one neonatal intensive care unit.
        Cyclical plan-do-study-act quality improvement (QI) methodology was utilized. Data were collected on inborn infants &lt; 27 weeks&#x2019; gestation (2012-2017) over 3 phases; pre-GHP (n = 80), Phase I (n = 42), and Phase II (n = 92). There were no statistically significant differences in infant characteristics. 
              A systematic approach to care of EP infants in the first hour of life resulted in improved short-term outcomes. Significant differences were observed in minutes to completion of GHP care [median (Q1,Q3) 110 (89,138) vs 111 (94,135) vs 92(74,129) respectively p = 0.0035], abnormal temperature (59% vs 26% vs 38%; p = 0.001) and hypoglycemia (18% vs 7% vs 4%; p = 0.012). 
              Evaluation of long-term morbidity and mortality did not reveal significant differences. However, there was an increase in the number of infants resuscitated and admitted at the cusp of viability (22 and 23 weeks gestation) over the three phases of the study (16%, 16%, 29%) similar to national trends of providing more aggressive care at earlier gestational ages. Although significant improvements in long-term outcomes were not observed, the lack of significant differences may represent a protective effect of GHP as the highest risks of morbidity and mortality are associated with the most premature infants. 
      Additional studies, larger sample sizes, and consistent analysis of long-term morbidities would provide greater insight into the impact of GHP. Ongoing QI should focus on sustaining achieved improvements, continuing to improve time to completion of care, and seeking additional, meaningful short-term outcome measures.

          <dc:description>This dissertation is an archaeological investigation of Catawba households occupied between ca. 1762 and 1800. The focus of this study is to identify the material signatures of Catawba household life and investigate the strategies Catawba people pursued during the late 18th century and how they changed through time. I examine archaeological data from three Catawba domestic sites, Old Town (RLA-SoC 634), Ayers Town (38YK534), and Nisbet (RLA-SoC 638), to identify patterns of household variability within and between these communities at multiple scales. I rely on three central aspects of household archaeological data: (1) the organization and layout of architectural remains and activity areas, (2) the patterned distribution of material culture, particularly Catawba-made colonoware ceramics, (3) and variation in Catawba foodways. 
        By combining a critical examination of historical and ethnohistorical documentation with archaeological analysis, I demonstrate that Catawba households, far from being homogenous entities, experimented with a variety of creative solutions that contributed to different material outcomes for households at each site and even within the site. I argue that the diversity of household strategies reflects both the presence of persistent internal tribal divisions that produced discrete communities of practice and a pragmatic approach to economic and cultural survival in which individuals, notably Catawba women, redeployed traditional skills and knowledge to novel economic niches. This analysis of Catawba household variability between ca. 1760 and 1800 is informed by, and builds on, previous archaeological studies of historic Catawba lifeways immediately preceding and following this period. These studies describe starkly different lifeways and cultural practices that belie the direct cultural continuity and relatively short temporal interval between them. The present work attempts to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate communities.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Critical Theory and Popular Culture: Preparing School Leaders for the Emerging Biracial Majority
      Since the implementation of the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) decision, school leaders have been tasked with the challenge of mitigating the historical and societal tensions that have existed between blacks and whites that developed during slavery. Despite the integration of blacks and white students within the same school building, American public schools continue to struggle with inclusiveness of all groups of students, as evidenced by the lack of success of certain minority groups (English, 2002; Shields, 2004). As a result, several diversity initiatives and reform efforts have been implemented (Sleeter, 2012; Wardle, 2000). Moreover, many educational leadership programs have begun adopting social justice frameworks in an effort to develop transformative leaders. Even with these attempts to recognize and include all groups of students, black-white biracial students are rarely included in educational research and literature (Root, 1996, 2001; Wardle, 2007; Williams, 2009, 2011). This dissertation was an inquiry into the pedagogical use of popular culture, in the form of film&#x2014;specifically films with biracial characters and in some instances other video texts&#x2014;for the purpose of engaging school leaders (principals and assistant principals) in critically reflective activities that merge theory and popular culture. The theories that the researcher employed are Stuart Hall&#x2019;s Encoding/Decoding and Critical Race Theory (CRT). Transformative leadership strategies are embedded throughout the pedagogical project, which serve as the primary justification for the dissertation format that results in an authentic product that consists of a 3-day professional learning experience.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Self-report measures are widely used for research and clinical assessment of adults with ASD, though there has been little research examining the convergence of self- and informant-report in this population. The present study examined agreement between reporters on measures of symptom severity, daily living skills, and quality of life, as well as predictive value of each reporter for independent living and employment outcomes. Results indicated no significant differences between caregiver and self-report ratings of symptom severity, though there were significant differences between reporters on ratings of daily living skills and quality of life. Despite discrepancies, caregiver and self-report scores were significantly positively correlated on all measures. Additionally, combining caregiver-report and self-report measures provided significantly higher predictive value of objective outcomes than did measures from a single reporter. These results indicate that self-report is valid for this population, but emphasizes the importance of a multi-informant approach in assessment and treatment planning.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Meducation: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Online Educational Video Intervention to Improve Glaucoma Eye Drop Technique and Adherence</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness in the United States. Progression of glaucoma can be prevented by reducing intraocular pressure using eye drop medications, but patients tend to have difficulty instilling eye drops correctly. Short educational videos may be helpful to instruct patients on correct eye drop instillation, but only one small study testing an educational video for glaucoma eye drop technique has been performed to date. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation was to determine the effectiveness of an online video intervention in improving self-efficacy, technique, and adherence to eye drops in glaucoma patients.
        Ninety-two patients with glaucoma, who self-administered their own eye drops and had less than perfect technique, were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled trial. They were randomized to watch the Meducation&#xAE; eye drop technique video in the intervention group, or a nutrition video in the control group. Five eye drop technique steps were assessed using objective video recordings at baseline, immediately after the video, and 1 month later. The secondary outcomes were eye drop technique self-efficacy and medication adherence. Linear regression models were used to determine whether the intervention group had better self-efficacy, technique, and adherence than the control group after adjusting for important covariates.
        Adjusted for baseline self-efficacy, intervention patients had better eye drop technique self-efficacy than controls immediately after the video (p=0.024) and at 1 month (p=0.015). Adjusted for baseline technique and other covariates, eye drop technique averaged 0.75 steps better in intervention patients than controls immediately after the video (p=0.002) and 0.63 steps better at 1 month (p=0.011). The intervention did not significantly improve adherence. Participants&#x2019; mean rating of usefulness of the video was 3.40 on a 4-point scale. Patients&#x2019; most preferred method for having access to the intervention was in the doctor&#x2019;s office exam room, but also desired online options for watching the video.
        We concluded that a short educational video can significantly improve glaucoma patients&#x2019; self-efficacy and eye drop technique. The video should be disseminated in multiple ways: in the exam room when drops are prescribed as well as online.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This analysis explores the relationship between a state&#x2019;s macroeconomic structure and welfare state typology, and its approach to educational differentiation. Educational differentiation describes the separation of students into unique curricular tracks, and has been widely discussed in studies of education and stratification. In this analysis, I explore whether patterns in national educational differentiation occur, based on states&#x2019; classification across two dimensions: variety of capitalism (based on Hall and Soskice&#x2019;s &#x201C;Varieties of Capitalism&#x201D; theory), and welfare state regime (based on Esping-Andersen&#x2019;s welfare state typologies). After operationalizing educational differentiation and taking measurements across a sample of nine European states, I conclude that, while some overarching trends exists, there is also significant within-classification variation in educational differentiation. I additionally examine primary government documents to identify patterns in states&#x2019; framing of education in relation to stratification and inequality based on the aforementioned classifications, and find no clear alignment with respective macroeconomic and welfare state characteristics.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper aims to analyze the relationship between domestic violence and terrorism through a comparison of terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom and the United States from 2011 to 2016. Academic frameworks for this paper include the new crime- terror nexus, research on toxic masculinity and terrorism, and research on the relationship between mass shootings and domestic violence. Research from the two case studies shows a correlational relationship between terrorist and domestic violence, with high proportions of perpetrators having violent criminal histories, specifically histories of domestic violence. This paper holds that, based on the results of the research, addressing violence against women is a valid counterterrorism tool. This paper argues that it is important for academics and law enforcement to look at a violent criminal history, specifically of domestic violence, as a potential factor for radicalization.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Haunted by Specters, Surrounded by Spectators explores the pervasive nature of digital media and the social web in challenging the ways we understand self, other, society, and the world around us. Juxtaposing the histories of public and private, both as terms and conditions, to contemporary understandings and communicative practices we enlist, this project considers the ways digital media and the social web fundamentally alter how we relate to each other through visuality at a distance rather than experientially, empathetically, and interpersonally. Exploring three pertinent case studies that highlight the fragmentation of identity when imagery is taken as the totality of those depicted, this project illuminates the process I call &#x201C;Crowdsourced Morality&#x201D; whereby individuals actively enlist imagery and physical and psychological distance to decontextualize, devalue, shame, and torment those depicted in visual content. So distanced from those captured in visual content, context becomes constituted in the mind of the viewer who visualizes the content and imbues it with his or her thoughts, beliefs, and values as he or she shares it across connective media with little to no regard for the person(s) depicted. As a consequence, individuals not only engage each other as information to be disposed of, which aids in the reduction of personal accountability for the actions they take against one another, they further perpetuate &#x201C;visuality as reality&#x201D; in denying the embodied, corporeal form of those depicted in visual content and those associated with them. Supplanting experiential engagement for vision, such nuanced practices of communication online not only drive us into further physical isolation from one another they contribute to greater selection and confirmation biases that encourage &#x201C;truthiness&#x201D;&#x2014;personal feeling over recognition and acknowledgement of others&#x2014;as well as, in America and certain other Western societies, the growing divide between liberal and conservative ideologies.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>ADDRESSING HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION RATES IN THE 11-12 YEAR OLD AGE GROUP THROUGH IMPROVED PROVIDER RECOMMENDATION</dc:title>
          <dc:date>2018-01-01T05:00:00Z</dc:date>

          <dc:description>Background/Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States and the cause of significant morbidity and mortality from HPV-related cancers. The HPV vaccine is recommended for 11-12 year olds for the prevention of HPV-related cancers.  Although HPV is recommended at the same visit as the Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine and Meningococcal vaccine, HPV vaccination rates remain low and trail Tdap and Meningococcal vaccination rates. Health care providers report the need for education of HPV and strategies to address vaccine hesitancy. Literature shows that providers with high HPV vaccination rates provide strong recommendations for the vaccine and parents report that the provider recommendation has the most influence on the decision to vaccinate. The purpose of this study is to determine influential factors for parental acceptance or refusal of the HPV vaccine and to increase HPV vaccination rates by improving provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine through education and implementation of an evidence-based communication tool. 
      Methods: The study was conducted at a pediatric primary care practice in North Carolina. Participant recruitment and consent took place on site.  Participants completed a pre- and post-communication survey, online education module, and pre- and post-knowledge assessment. Providers implemented the AAP HPV Champion toolkit for the recommendation for the HPV vaccine at 11-12 year old well visits over a three-month time period.  During the same period, parents of 11-12 year old patients presenting for well visits were surveyed regarding influential factors for their decision to accept or refuse the HPV vaccine for their child.  
      Results: Provider knowledge of HPV increased after completing the education.  Vaccine rates increased from baseline with the most significant improvement in HPV vaccine rates. Reasons for parental acceptance or refusal of the HPV vaccine reflect what is found in the literature. 
      Conclusions and Implications: Provider education and implementation of an evidence-based communication tool for the recommendation of the HPV vaccine can increase HPV vaccination rates in the 11-12 year old age group.  Understanding influential factors for the acceptance or refusal of the HPV vaccine can be used to strengthen HPV vaccine recommendations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>PERINEURONAL NETS IN HIPPOCAMPAL AREA CA2: REGULATION BY ACTIVITY AND DISEASE</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) first appear in the brain during early postnatal development and increase until they are fully expressed in adulthood, often tracking the end of critical windows of synaptic plasticity1, 2. The experience-dependent development of PNNs in the brain is thought to function as a molecular brake on plasticity during the closure of these critical windows 3, 4. PNNs are typically associated with inhibitory neurons throughout the brain; however, I characterized a dense localization of PNNs surrounding a population of excitatory pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2. I found that PNNs in CA2 function to restrict plasticity at CA2 synapses in mice 14-18 days old (P14-18). I also identified a novel window of plasticity in area CA2, P8-11, an age prior to the maturation of PNNs in CA2. PNNs are reportedly altered in several neurodevelopmental disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and Rett syndrome. I found that PNNs are precociously increased and develop prematurely in a Rett mouse model. Moreover, PNNs appear to be at least one mechanism restricting plasticity prematurely in CA2 of the Rett model mouse. Finally, because PNNs are regulated by pathological activity, I characterize PNNs in a TLE mouse model. PNNs were attenuated in CA2 by age P45, but were unchanged at younger ages after the onset of seizures (P21). To further examine how activity regulates PNNs in CA2, we chemogenetically increased or decreased CA2 activity for five days and found that PNNs are inversely regulated by activity in CA2. Overall, these findings reveal a critical function for PNNs in restricting plasticity in CA2 and identify a novel, yet-to-be described, window of plasticity in the hippocampus.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Teachers are a resource, and equitable resource allocation must include the equitable distribution of teachers across all schools. Previous research has found that high poverty and minority students are more likely to be taught by inexperienced and unqualified teachers, and teachers frequently leave schools serving these students for schools with fewer disadvantaged students (Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2005; Goldring, Taie, &amp; Riddles, 2014; Hanushek, Kain, &amp; Rivkin, 2004; Ingersoll, 2004; Loeb, Darling-Hammond, &amp; Luczak, 2005). Further, previous research indicates that the challenges these schools face retaining effective teachers is due to poor working conditions, not teachers&#x2019; discontent with their students (Boyd et al., 2011; Johnson, Kraft, &amp; Papay, 2012; Ladd, 2011). These findings establish a need to investigate how current polices may have contributed to the disparities in teacher retention rates. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of North Carolina&#x2019;s new definition of a low-performing school on teacher retention and teacher working conditions. 
      This study used a quantitative causal-comparative design and analyzed secondary administrative data files from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction as well as survey data from the North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that newly designated low-performing schools had lower average teacher retention rates and lower average North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey results than other schools in the state. Multiple regression analysis found that the relationship between the state&#x2019;s new definition of a low-performing school and teacher retention rates was not statistically significant, and the relationship between the state&#x2019;s new definition of a low-performing school and teacher working condition survey results was statistically significant. Findings indicate that the state&#x2019;s new definition a low-performing school negatively impacted teacher working conditions at newly designated low-performing schools and suggest that these schools will need to improve teacher working conditions in order to raise teacher retention rates to the state average.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation is a comparative ethnography of two groups of transnational soybean farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado. In this exploration of migration and industrial crop production for global markets, the new capacity for highly flexible farming is examined in relation to the fixity of family tradition, religious practices, landscapes, and expertise born of working the land.
      In 1968, Holdeman Mennonites embarked on a tour of rural Brazil. In search of autonomy from an encroaching cultural crisis, they found cheap farm land in Rio Verde, Goi&#xE1;s and encountered a government eager for their migration. Decades later, a group of Midwestern family farmers toured rural Brazil and found cheap, expansive land to occupy. They courted investors (mostly neighboring farmers), bought massive tracts of land, and settled in Luis Eduardo Magalh&#xE3;es, Bahia.
      The two groups&#x2019; migrations began with experiences of crisis: for the Mennonites a cultural crisis in the United States that threatened their family and community reproduction and for the Midwestern family farmers a farm crisis which threatened their livelihoods. In Brazil they adopted common farming techniques related to soil fertilization and tillage, yet differed in crop rotations, use of technology, and most starkly in their perceptions of what counted as &#x201C;good farming.&#x201D; Each community internally contested identity and value as they made meaning out of transnational lives and industrial farming.
      These cases problematize how we understand large-scale processes of the South American soy boom, the massive expansion of soy production in South America, the global land grab, and the proliferation of global land deals. This dissertation identifies difference and generativity of farming in two communities of transnational soybean farmers while also recognizing the power and domination behind such massive economic processes. The Holdeman Mennonite community pursues an alternative to soybean development in their use of family labor, avoidance of capital and technology, and diversified farming practices. The community of Midwestern family farmers adopts capitalist managerial and farming practices, yet reconcile this with their values of good farming. Together they reveal areas of convergence and divergence that make industrial, transnational soybean production possible.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In artistic works combining music and narration, composers have long used music to make statements about the works&#x2019; characters. Though much related scholarship exists concerning opera and film, little has been written about video game music and characters. This thesis argues that video game composers have used diegetic music &#x2013; music making in which game characters participate &#x2013; to draw attention to the categorical differences that distinguish characters of minority groups from the game&#x2019;s majority. Drawing from scholarship on music and gender, critical race theory, and traditional Western music theory, I argue that the characters in three Fire Emblem games perform music inspired by real-world musical stereotypes associated with women and racially peripheral groups. Finally, I identify and fill, through a proposed syllabus, a lacuna in game music pedagogy so that undergraduate students might be taught to critically engage with these subject matters in and through video games.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This thesis analyzes the modification of asylum policy by the Federal Republic of Germany in the face of mass migration. It argues that the German experience shows that states prioritize protecting state sovereignty over adhering to humanitarian obligations by examining two litmus tests in the history of German asylum policy: first, the response to German Unification and the wars in the former Yugoslavia; and second, the reactions to the Arab Spring and the Syrian Civil War.
      Through the analysis of discourse and institutional framing, the thesis explores how the German government initially implemented inclusive asylum policies, but then resorted to more restrictive measures when pressured by domestic actors during mass migrations. While there is much evidence for Germany&#x2019;s historical commitment to international humanitarian treaties, when faced with domestic pressures, including conservative political parties and economic strains, the German government implemented restrictive asylum measures.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>WEIGHT STIGMA AND ACCULTURATION IN RELATION TO HAIR CORTISOL AND BINGE EATING IN ASIAN AMERICANS WITH OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Weight stigma is a pervasive social problem in Americans, but little is known about its impact on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and binge eating behaviors among Asian Americans.  The aims of the study were to 1) examine the relationship between weight stigma and hair cortisol among Asian Americans with overweight and obesity; 2) examine the relationship between weight stigma and binge eating among Asian Americans with overweight and obesity; 3) examine whether the level of acculturation moderates the relationships of weight stigma with hair cortisol and binge eating among Asian Americans with overweight and obesity.  Using a cross-sectional study design, data were collected from a convenience sample of 166 Asian American adults with overweight and obesity living in North Carolina, United States (U.S.).  The participants primarily identified as first generation (94%), had a mean age of 45.7 years, and a mean body mass index of 26.6 kg/m2.  A 50 milligrams hair sample, height and weight, demographic data, hair-related data, the frequency of weight stigma, binge eating, level of acculturation for Asians, perceived racial discrimination for Asians, and perceived stress was collected.  Description analysis, between-groups comparison, Spearman correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analyses were used for all aims.  The results demonstrated that weight stigma was negatively correlated with hair cortisol and positively correlated with binge eating.  After adjusting for age, perceived racism and perceived stress, weight stigma demonstrated a negative association with hair cortisol, but this result was not statistically significant.  After adjusting for age, BMI, years lived in the U.S., perceived racism and perceived stress, weight stigma was significantly associated with binge eating.  The level of acculturation did not significantly moderate the relationships of weight stigma with hair cortisol and binge eating after adjusting for age, BMI, years lived in the U.S., perceived racism and perceived stress.  The findings highlighted the importance of alerting the public regarding the negative effects of weight stigma and including Asian American communities as targets of anti-weight bias interventions to decrease bullying and stigmatization toward Asian Americans with overweight and obesity.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The existence of young stars in the central parsec of the Milky Way&#x2019;s Galactic Center (GC) is challenging to explain due to the extreme tidal field of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A*, which is expected to disrupt any potentially star forming gas in its vicinity. Yet, numerical models indicate that star formation may occur in this region through two processes. First, the formation and fragmentation of a dense gas disk, which results from rapid gas inflow towards the SMBH, is the most likely origin for the observed stellar disk in the GC. Second, the extreme gravitational compression of low mass gas &#x201C;clumps&#x201D; on eccentric orbits around the SMBH provides an alternative explanation for isolated star clusters, as well as newly forming stars, that are not associated with the stellar disk. I build upon these previous theories of nuclear star formation by using three-dimensional grid-based radiative-hydrodynamic simulations to consider the role of ionizing radiation. I begin with an implementation of an adaptive radiative transfer routine for the Athena code. I then explore how radiation arising from accretion onto the SMBH may affect the process of gas inflow and stellar disk formation. I then consider the effect of radiation from existing stars on continued star formation occurring via the infall of low-mass gas clumps.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In people&#x2019;s imagination, dying seems dreadful; however, these perceptions may not reflect reality. In two studies, we compared the affective experience of people facing imminent death with that of people imagining imminent death. Study 1 revealed that blog posts of near-death patients with cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were more positive and less negative than the simulated blog posts of nonpatients&#x2014;and also that the patients&#x2019; blog posts became more positive as death neared. Study 2 revealed that the last words of death-row inmates were more positive and less negative than the simulated last words of noninmates&#x2014;and also that these last words were less negative than poetry written by death-row inmates. Together, these results suggest that the experience of dying&#x2014;even because of terminal illness or execution&#x2014;may be more pleasant than one imagines.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Lloyd (2005) analyzes every proposed evolutionary explanation of female orgasm and argues that all but one su&#xFB00;er from serious evidential errors. Lloyd attributes these errors to two main biases: androcentrism and adaptationism. But, there is an alternative explanation for the discrepancies in the case of the female orgasm that Lloyd&#x2019;s analysis overlooks. I present and argue for the plausibility of this alternative explanation. In short, the alternative explanation is that an imprecise definition of orgasm is what&#x2019;s partially responsible for the missteps in this research domain. Further, Lloyd takes her analysis to support Lonigno&#x2019;s (1990) Contextual Empiricist model. Insofar as Lloyd&#x2019;s analysis fails to capture an important part of scientific practice the alternative explanation picks out, this might reveal a shortcoming for Contextual Empiricism.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation contributes to the literature on decision-making under poverty by empirically examining the relationship between income poverty and the decisions that households make due to shocks. This dissertation is composed of three essays attempting to identify ways policy can be used to influence the trajectory of poverty for generations to come. Each chapter focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the decision-making processes of households and individuals living in poverty. In the first essay, I identify the indirect impact of the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program on youths&#x2019; present bias, by examining the intergenerational transmission of such bias within the household from caregivers to youth. The second essay is focused on negative income shocks and marriage outcomes for youth in rural Malawi. The paper utilizes survey data from a cohort of unmarried youth and follows them over three years as they transition into and out of relationships, identifying the influence negative shocks have on these outcomes. In the final essay, I show the impacts of the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program and the Zambia Child Grant Program on stress and affect, and, subsequently, whether these psychological indicators affect savings and intertemporal choices.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Embryonal carcinomas (ECs) and mixed testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) containing EC express CD30 and are the most aggressive TGCT subtypes. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) combine the cytotoxic properties of T cells with the antigen specificity of monoclonal antibodies to target antigen-expressing cells, such as infected or cancerous cells. CAR-Ts targeting CD30 (CD30.CAR-Ts) have shown robust anti-tumor activity against Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma, but have not been tested against solid tumors. We tested whether CD30.CAR-Ts could also target ECs using in vitro and in vivo models. CD30.CAR-Ts exhibited anti-tumor activity in vitro against the human EC cell lines Tera-1, Tera-2 and NCCIT, and putative EC stem cells identified by Hoechst dye staining. Cytolytic activity of CD30.CAR-Ts was complemented by sustained proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. CD30.CAR-Ts also demonstrated anti-tumor activity in an in vivo xenograft NSG mouse model of metastatic EC. Remarkably, we observed that CD30.CAR-Ts, while targeting CD30+ EC tumor cells through the CAR (i.e. antigen-dependent targeting), also eliminated surrounding CD30&#x2013; EC cells in an antigen-independent manner via cell-cell contact-dependent Fas/FasL interaction. In addition, inducing Fas (CD95) expression in CD30+ but Fas&#x2013; EC was sufficient to improve CD30.CAR-T anti-tumor activity. Overall, these data suggest that CD30.CAR-Ts can be used as a novel immunotherapy for ECs. Additionally, Fas/FasL interaction between tumor cells and CAR-Ts can be exploited to reduce tumor escape due to heterogeneous antigen expression or to improve CAR-T anti-tumor activity.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Origins of Secessionist Conflict: Predicting When Governments Will and Will Not Permit Secession</dc:title>

          <dc:description>A question understudied in the literature on separatist conflict is why some governments permit secession to occur peacefully while others resist it militarily. To fill that gap, this dissertation presents a model that explains why dictatorships virtually always resort to military force to thwart self-determination movements while democracies usually permit secession. Dictators need a tough image to deter potential revolutionaries and palace coups and fear that ignoring separatist activity, even if it poses no direct threat to their rule, signals vulnerability that may encourage political rivals to challenge them. Peaceful secession from non-democracies only occurs when dictators initiate the separation for their own benefit, thereby avoiding the appearance of regime vulnerability.
      The electorates of democracies, on the other hand, are reluctant to incur the costs of suppressing secessionist movements. An exception is when there exists in the territory claimed by the secessionists an enfranchised loyalist population that has reason to fear persecution should the secessionists win independence. When loyalists&#x2019; livelihood depends on continued rule by the metropolis, the magnitude of the benefit to them of thwarting secession far exceeds the diffused cost to the metropolis&#x2019;s population of waging an anti-secessionist counterinsurgency. Consequently, if loyalists are enfranchised, they mostly become single-issue voters when secessionists threaten their privileged status and are able to out organize the peace camp.
      This dissertation uses crisp set qualitative comparative analysis of the population of secessionist movements active between 1961 and 2007 and case studies to test its hypotheses. And, except for some anomalies surrounding India&#x2019;s counterinsurgencies in her Northeastern states and Kashmir, the model accounts for the entire population of cases.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Radiation therapy is an important tool in the treatment of women with gynecologic cancers. An increased incidence of spontaneous hip fractures is observed in women after receiving therapeutic irradiation. 
        In this study, we explored the relationship between dosage and bone health by exposing sixteen-week-old C57BL6/J mice to both acute and fractionated dosages of ionizing radiation. The mice were divided into three groups &#x2013; 18 Gy single acute dose, 3 x 6 Gy fractionated dose and non-irradiated controls. Bones were collected 14 days after irradiation. MicroCT and finite element analyses were used to characterize microarchitectural and structural changes in the proximal metaphysis of the tibia. 
        Trabecular volume, connectivity density and bone mineral density all declined in the irradiated groups. The fractionated dose group did not demonstrate different bone loss than the single acute dose group in a statistically significant way. Further work is required to elucidate the complex relationship between single acute dose and its fractionated counterpart.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Melanoma, the most lethal skin cancer, has an incremental incidence, few durable therapies, and a low survival rate of less than 10 % for late-stage patients in clinics. In desmoplastic melanoma, a rare histological variant of melanoma, the highly fibrotic morphology as well as the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment led to distinct clinical behavior when compared with other melanoma subtypes, thus hindering treatment efficacy. To overcome these therapeutic hurdles, herein in this dissertation work I developed multiple innovative strategies based on targeted nano-delivery systems. These strategies include the effective delivery of therapeutic vaccination, immune-modulating chemo-drugs and active compounds, gene therapy, and a combination of chemo-immune initiated/guided treatment. A total of five aims were sequentially designed, including 1) nano-vaccination. The tumor-specific antigen peptides were efficiently delivered to antigen-presenting cells along with immune-stimulating adjuvant. This therapeutic vaccine inhibited aggressive tumor growth. 2) nano-sunitinib. The FDA approved drug sunitinib was targeted delivered to the tumor with improved anti-tumor efficacy, furthermore, it largely remodeled immune suppressive microenvironment and facilitated vaccination efficacy. 3) nano-fraxinellone. The active compound fraxinellone was nano-delivered to the tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the transition of tumor associated fibroblasts and skewed TGF-&#x3B2;/IFN- &#x3B3; balancing toward pro-inflammatory settings. 4) nano-wnt5a trap. Key molecular wnt5a secreted by tumor cells in inducing dendritic cell tolerance and tumor fibrosis was locally trapped, thus significantly tuned immune recognition and surveillance of cancer progression. 5) nano-delivery of mitoxantrone and celastrol. Two drugs were screened out with highest anti-tumor and anti-fibrosis potentials and worked synergistically in inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and long-term memory immune responses. Using animal models of desmoplastic melanoma, our nanomedicine designs significantly elicited an overall anti-tumor immunity with increased efficacy, safety profiles, and prolonged host survival, suggesting their high translatability to the clinic. This dissertation research work further sheds light on a deeper understanding of cancer type-specific microenvironment and immune modulators, as well as future mechanism studies in designing immunotherapy for desmoplastic melanoma.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study aims to investigate how the concept &#x2018;integration&#x2019; is perceived by migrant activists online. I ask migrant activists in France, a case of exceptional integration controversy, how they conceptualize and present integration discourse online through social media channels, transnational networks that often amplify ideological extremes. How do these activists define integration? What are their projected solutions to difficulties with integration? Equally, are these online self- representations strategic?
      Methods consist of written interviews with a panel of six migrant activists in France, operating across social media. Data from interviews is juxtaposed against the observation of public postings. They suggest that social media activism engages reactively and emotionally with a transnational community on political topics. Discussions engage social, cultural, and economic integration dimensions. Within them, integration is framed as both &#x2018;acceptance&#x2019; and &#x2018;access&#x2019;, expressing a specific need for the sharing of useful information and resources for migrants, who are often uninformed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>According to traditional historiography, seventeenth-century French theater is characterized by a pure, unified, classical and disciplined aesthetic known as Classicism. However, several theatrical pieces resist this Classical ideal with special effects and the use of theater machines. My dissertation examines this &#x201C;spectacular aesthetic&#x201D; that plays a fundamental role in theater production throughout the century. I show that theater machines were used across genres, in tragedies, comedies, tragi-com&#xE9;dies, com&#xE9;die-ballets, ballets de cour and operas. The ubiquity of machine effects in all kinds of dramatic entertainment testifies to the power or popularity of the spectacular throughout the Classical period. This project also examines how playwrights and engineers use machines to stage powerful acts or perhaps undermine the authority behind those acts. My dissertation unfolds in three chapters, each devoted to exploring the efficacy of dramatic spectacle from aesthetic, critical and cultural early modern perspectives. By focusing on the value playwrights, machinists, and actors had for the effects theater machines produced, I will expand upon our understanding of how dramatists interpreted the range of affective responses to theater, including but not limited to Aristotle&#x2019;s catharsis. Moreover, by comparing seventeenth-century approaches to the spectacular with more recent thinking about the role of technology in producing wondrous effects in entertainment, the dissertation compares seventeenth-century notions with today&#x2019;s understandings of the affective responses to spectacle.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>My dissertation utilizes the natural experiment of Puerto Rico's debt crisis in order to investigate the economic effects of (sub)sovereign default risk and the pricing of security contract provisions.
      The first chapter uses the interesting case of Puerto Rico to address the questions:
      do investors price contract provisions and the related law? Does the pricing of contract
      provisions vary with credit risk? Puerto Rico provides an interesting case allowing the study
      of three different types of contract provisions in the presence of high and increasing
      credit risk; a strong legal system; and rich data to select well matched control groups.
      I find that investors indeed price contract provisions specifying governing law, securing
      debt with specific revenues, and including collective action clauses. I also find that
      investors especially price these contract provisions when credit risk is highest.
      The second chapter uses Puerto Rico's unique characteristics as a U.S. territory to examine the
      real effects of (sub) sovereign default risk. In the post-2012 period of increased default
      probabilities, Puerto Rico spirals into a significant decline and the co-integrating
      relationship with real activity on the US mainland breaks down. Cross-industry variation
      in default risk exposure identifies significantly higher employment growth declines
      in external finance and government demand dependent industries. Using government
      bond yields and stock returns we confirm that news of increased default risk raises the
      cost of capital for the Puerto Rican government and for publicly traded Puerto Rican
      firms.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>DELIBERATE PRACTICE WITH MASTERY LEARNING: USING AN ONLINE APPROACH TO DEVELOP NURSING STUDENTS&#x2019; INTERPROFESSIONAL CRITICAL INCIDENT REPORTING SKILLS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Communication breakdown among healthcare providers is a major contributing factor in healthcare errors that could lead to serious patient harm. The ability to convey patient information accurately and promptly is pivotal in order for healthcare providers to make informed care decisions. However, pre-licensure nursing students rarely have opportunities to practice reporting patient information to non-nurse healthcare providers. The use of deliberate practice (DP), a conceptual model for skills acquisition, is widely used to develop psychomotor clinical skills and demonstrate effectiveness. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the feasibility of using DP to develop communication skills for pre-licensure nursing students. This project examines the impacts of using an online DP intervention that is guided by mastery learning theory on learners&#x2019; skill performance and confidence in reporting a patient critical incident using the standardized communication tool, SBAR (situation, background, assessment, recommendation).
      This dissertation is composed of three papers. The first paper is a systematized review of the current literature on the use of DP in developing clinical communication skills. The second paper describes the design and evaluation of story-guided online DP sessions to provide learners with an avenue to practice reporting a patient critical incident. Based on a 10-week pilot experimental study, the third paper examines the impact of engaging in regular online DP, at least five sessions for the intervention group (n = 22) versus two for the control group (n = 21), on learners&#x2019; ability to achieve a preset mastery standard and on any changes in their SBAR performance and confidence.
      The results of the systematized review support the continued study of DP for developing clinical communication skills to produce further evidence of its effectiveness. Feasibility testing of the online DP sessions shows that this cost-effective teaching/learning approach could provide highly satisfactory learning experiences and be adopted into nursing curricula. The results of the pilot experimental study indicate that the intervention group learners showed significantly (p &lt; .05) greater improvement in their performance and confidence levels than the control group after controlling for covariates. Two intervention group learners (versus none in the control group) met the mastery standard. Future study is needed to examine the number of practice sessions needed to attain mastery, retain skills, and determine the effects on patient outcomes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Geographies of (dis)advantage in walking and cycling: Perspectives on equity and social justice in planning for active transportation in U.S. cities</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In recent years, cities across the U.S. have increasingly invested in programs, policies, and infrastructure to support active transportation. Some have suggested that these investments could help to address health disparities observed by race and socioeconomic status (SES) in the U.S., given that walking and cycling are physically active and low-cost modes of transportation. Despite this potential, there is emerging evidence that active transportation investments have been inequitably distributed across communities of varying sociodemographic composition. For instance, cycling advocates have recently argued that low-income and minority populations have disproportionately low access to safe, convenient infrastructure such as bike lanes. At the same time, some active transportation projects have recently faced opposition in several large U.S. cities due to concerns about gentrification.
      Limited research has considered the distribution of active transportation infrastructure and potential associations between cycling investment and sociodemographic change. I address this gap through three related analyses. First, I examine how different sociodemographic groups are distributed across space with respect to built environment characteristics in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland. I find that low-SES and minority populations tend to live in more walkable neighborhoods, but are less likely to be distributed across a full range of neighborhood types. Second, I examine cross-sectional associations between bike lane access and area-level sociodemographic characteristics in 22 large U.S. cities. I find that even after adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand, access to bike lanes is lower in areas with lower educational attainment, higher proportions of Hispanic residents, and lower SES. Third, I examine longitudinal associations between new bike lane infrastructure and sociodemographic change between 1990 and 2015 in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland. I find evidence that new bike lanes occurred disproportionately in areas that were either already advantaged or increasing in advantage over time.
      These analyses reveal sociodemographic differences in access to environments and infrastructure that support active transportation, often suggesting lower access among disadvantaged populations. Addressing these disparities, however, is complicated by associations between infrastructure investment and sociodemographic change. Efforts to expand active transportation infrastructure should recognize concerns about gentrification and carefully consider the social context of infrastructure investment.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Enchanting Stories and Secular Scripts: Religion and Secularization in Selected Works by Miguel de Unamuno</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation examines religious and secular stories, their intersections, and the possibilities of enchantment that these stories and their intersections might offer modern man in four works by Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936): Amor y pedagog&#xED;a (1902), Del sentimiento tr&#xE1;gico de la vida en los hombres y en los pueblos (1913), Niebla (1914), and San Manuel Bueno, m&#xE1;rtir (1930).  These works, by combining, twisting, and distorting religious and secular stories, underscore the literary quality and tropes of both kinds of narratives and question the supposed break between the modern and the pre-modern and the distinction between &#x201C;enchanted&#x201D; and &#x201C;disenchanted.&#x201D;  I argue that there are four interrelated narratives of enchantment within these works: the story of losing religion, the story of learning religion, the story of experience, and the story of uncertainty.  The story of losing religion traces the changes to and decline of Christianity in Spain and Europe and offers a possibility of the continuance of the religious tradition through modifications and distortions of Christian myth and secular explanations of the world.  In the story of learning I explore what Unamuno and his characters deem &#x201C;religious&#x201D; and how el hombre de carne y hueso of Del sentimiento tr&#xE1;gico and Unamuno&#x2019;s fictional characters acquire beliefs in spirits and god through experiences that the body and the embodied mind have with their surroundings and others.  The story of experience reveals how experiences that violate the physical properties of the body connect transcendent and immanent realms by breaking down the dichotomies of nature/society, primitive/modern, and religious/secular and advances a counternarrative to secular accounts of compartmentalized social life and privatized religion.  The story of uncertainty, a story about stories and how they are related, by exposing the fictionality of any claim to truth, subverts both secular and religious narratives and offers that uncertainty might constitute a modern enchantment.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Analyzing almanacs, how-to manuals, and receipt books and drama, &#x201C;Reading the Natural and Preternatural Worlds in Early Modern Drama,&#x201D; argues that the stage is in dialogue with vernacular natural philosophical print. The project shows how this archive, taken up by early modern playwrights, complicates our understanding of the methods of deduction in the period and those who might contribute their experiential knowledge of natural and preternatural phenomena to the period&#x2019;s sciences. In chapters on Mother Bombie and The Wise Woman of Hogsdon, All&#x2019;s Well That Ends Well, Doctor Faustus, Bartholomew Fair, and Macbeth, the dissertation reads drama equally invested as vernacular print in producing knowledge. The stage offered a means for playing with the modes of interpretation articulated in manual literature, and drama offered an approach that accounted for the intervention of magical agents in the creation of knowledge. The dissertation demonstrates that the frame of science studies can direct our inquiries more accurately towards the many stakeholders in the creation of knowledge on the early modern stage. In focusing on marginalized knowledge, this project explores how the early modern stage was an active venue for participating in the intellectual landscape of the period. Broadening the archive to these under-studied texts, the contributors in the production of knowledge also dilates to include unlikely figures. The project thus captures the uncanny &#x201C;cunning&#x201D; of figures such as white witches, female healers, criminals, and clowns.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Interaction between Learning and Speciation</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Assortative mating displays, preferences, or both can be affected by learning across a wide range of animal taxa, but the specifics of how this learning affects speciation with gene flow are not well understood. I use population genetic models with trait learning to investigate how the identity of the tutor affects the divergence of a self-referent phenotype-matching trait. I find that oblique learning (learning from unrelated individual of the previous generation) and maternal learning mask sexual selection and therefore do not allow the maintenance of divergence. In contrast, by enhancing positive frequency-dependent sexual selection, paternal learning can maintain more divergence than genetic inheritance, but leads to the loss of polymorphism more easily. Furthermore, paternal learning inhibits the invasion of a novel self-referent phenotype-matching trait, especially in a large population. 
      Reinforcement is the process through which assortative mating evolves by natural selection to reduce costly hybridization. Sexual imprinting could facilitate reinforcement by decreasing hybridization, or it could impede the process if heterotypic pairs imprint on each other. Either result could then subsequently affect speciation. Here, I use deterministic population genetic simulations to explore conditions under which sexual imprinting can evolve through reinforcement. I demonstrate that sexual imprinting can evolve as a one-allele assortative mating mechanism by reducing the risk of hybridization. The evolution of imprinting has the unexpected side effect of homogenizing an existing innate preference, because the imprinted preference overrides the effect of innate preference, effectively making it neutral. I also find that the weight of the imprinting component in the female preference may evolve to a lower value when migration and divergent selection are strong and the cost of hybridization is low, conditions which make it beneficial for maladaptive immigrant females to acquire locally adaptive genes by hybridizing with the local males. Together, these results suggest that sexual imprinting has the capacity to promote or retard divergence through complex interactions, and can itself evolve as part of the speciation process.
      The effect of learned culture (e.g., birdsong dialects and human languages) on genetic divergence is unclear. Previous theoretical research suggests that because oblique learning allows phenotype transmission from individuals with no offspring to an unrelated individual in the next generation, the effect of sexual selection on the learned trait is masked. However, I propose that migration and spatially constrained learning can form a statistical association between cultural and genetic traits, which may allow selection on the cultural traits to indirectly affect the genetic traits. Here, I build a population genetic model that allows such a statistical association to form, and found that sexual selection and divergent selection on the cultural trait can indeed help maintain genetic divergence through such a statistical association. Furthermore I found that the genetic divergence maintained by this effect persists even when the cultural trait changes over time due to drift and mutation. These results suggest the role of obliquely transmitted traits in evolution may be underrated, and the lack of one-to-one associations between cultural and genetic traits may not be sufficient to disprove the role of culture in divergence.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>THE PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME: IMPACT ON RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN QUALITY OF CARE</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Objective: The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model on disparities in quality of care among populations with major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid chronic physical conditions.
      Methods: Applying instrumental variable techniques to account for differential selection into treatment, we used generalized estimating equations and generalized linear models to determine the probability of receiving eight disease-specific quality measures for adults age 18-64 years with MDD and diabetes. Our independent variables of interest were enrollment in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH), as well as level of NCQA recognition. We used a rank-and-replace method to measure disparities between racial groups, based on the Institute of Medicine definition.
      Results: We found that while PCMH enrollment may improve overall quality of care, the effect is inconsistent across racial groups and not always associated with reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We found no association between level of NCQA PCMH recognition and improvement in quality. Finally, we found that considerable HTE exists among PCMH enrollees, and this heterogeneity is driven by patient race, sex, age, rurality, and number of chronic comorbidities.
      &#x2003;
      Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the PCMH model alone may be insufficient to meet the needs of diverse patient populations. Providers and policymakers should consider racial/ethnic disparities and heterogeneous treatment effects explicitly when designing, implementing, and evaluating PCMH programs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Influence of Overweight- and Obesity-associated Mammary Adipose Inflammation on Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a collection of highly proliferative and invasive breast cancers primarily comprised of the basal-like (BBC) and claudin-low (CLBCs) molecular subtypes. We previously reported that weight gain and weight loss regulated pre-neoplastic lesion formation, tumor latency, and tumor progression in C3(1)-TAg mice, a transgenic model of spontaneous BBC. These findings coincided with elevated concentration of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), ligand for the proto-oncogene cMET, in the mammary microenvironment of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Thus, herein we conducted a two-phase study investigating whether crizotinib, an inhibitor of cMET, would delay onset of BBC in low-fat (LFD) and HFD-fed C3(1)-TAg mice. When administered prophylactically &#x2013; before tumor onset &#x2013; crizotinib did not significantly affect tumor progression or tumor burden. However, with therapeutic treatment following tumor development, crizotinib significantly reduced tumor multiplicity and vascularity in LFD- and HFD-fed C3(1)-TAg mice. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying &#x201C;windows of susceptibility&#x201D; during which HGF/cMET signaling may play disproportionately greater roles in BBC onset and progression. 
      We next hypothesized that adult weight gain and an inflammatory overweight mammary microenvironment would augment CLBC progression, while weight loss before tumor development would normalize overweight-associated tumor promotion. Therefore, a C3(1)-TAg-derived CLBC cell line was orthotopically transplanted into lean, overweight, and formerly overweight female FVB/NJ mice. Indeed, overweight accelerated tumor progression and induced pro-inflammatory changes in the mammary gland, including increased growth factor expression and crown-like structure formation. Weight loss abrogated overweight-induced tumor growth and reduced expression of mitogenic and metastasis-associated signaling pathways in tumors, significantly attenuating inflammation-induced CLBC progression. Interestingly, overweight also resulted in enhanced expression of a mast cell transcriptional signature in whole mammary tissue. Increased mast cell scores were also observed in cancer-adjacent breast tissue of overweight and obese relative to normal weight breast cancer patients. Conversely, lower intratumoral mast cell score was significantly associated with both triple-negative subtype and elevated risk-of-recurrence score in human breast cancers. Taken together, our results support that excess adiposity facilitates TNBC aggression. Further elucidation of adiposity-driven mechanisms of tumor progression and the efficacy of preventive measures such as weight loss could have tremendous potential for public health.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Localized energy estimates for perturbed wave equations exterior to non-star-shaped obstacles</dc:title>

          <dc:description>We establish integrated localized energy estimates for wave equations with small, time-dependent pertubations in exterior domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the case where the obstacle can be illuminated from its exterior by a smooth, convex bounded body.  This is a generalization of the case of a star-shaped obstacle, for which such estimates are known by prior results.  These estimates for perturbed wave equations are particularly useful in applications to quasilinear waves.
      To establish the estimates, we integrate space-time divergence identities that we develop.  In doing so, we are forced to deal with a surface integral on the boundary of our obstacle.  We utilize the illuminated coordinate system to produce a multiplier that gives a definite sign in the boundary integral.  Such multiplier techniques seem to produce an unsigned lower order error term in the volume integrals, and so the resulting estimate is useful only for solutions that are localized to very high frequencies.
      With straightforward multiplier techniques unavailable to us to establish a single estimate valid for all frequencies,  inspired by recent results, we look separately at the case of very low frequencies and the case of frequencies bounded away from zero.  The estimate we prove for very low frequencies relies only on the Dirichlet boundary condition and is valid regardless of the geometry, so no use of the illuminated coordinate system is necessary.  We then implement Carleman-type estimates involving exponential weights.  Because we are forced to address the surface integral on the boundary of the obstacle, we work in illuminated coordinates, but the weights produced in proving the Carleman estimates give rise to a lower order error term that can be made as small as necessary to establish an estimate for solutions that are frequency localized to any region bounded away from frequency zero.  We are then able to appropriately estimate the error terms that arise when we commute frequency cutoffs with our small, time-dependent perturbation.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>A collection of three case studies on District-level Equity Leaders (DELs), this study aims to fill the current void in the research on DELs and equity work at the district level in public schools, using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) lens. The study&#x2019;s primary focus is to document the lived experiences of individuals in this work and how they understand and fulfill their roles - especially in the context of current educational, social, and political spheres. This includes 1) how they define their positions and implement their vision for their positions, 2) how they respond to barriers and/or setbacks they encounter, 3) how their experiences are similar or different across districts, and 4) how the CRT tenets most commonly found in education &#x2013;permanence of racism, interest convergence, Whiteness as property, counternarratives versus majoritarian narratives, critique of liberalism, and intersectionality (Capper, 2015) &#x2013; manifest in and/or impact district level equity leadership roles.
      This study concludes that DELs featured in the research all operationalize a CRT framework that manifests both implicitly and explicitly in the work they do each day to further their visions for their districts and to mobilize a response to the barriers and setbacks they encounter. The participants all bring passion, personal motivation, and a strong connection to equity related work in their districts. Their job descriptions, daily responsibilities, and duties are impactful only because each of these men is tied deeply to the importance of equity, grounded in their foundations in academic research, their own lived experiences, and their desire to end inequity in schools. 
      Despite differences in district, years of experience, personality, and personal approach to the work, these DELs are remarkably similar in the implementation of their vision for their roles, the barriers and challenges they experience, and regarding the impacts of CRT within their district-level equity work. The design of professional development, specialized programming, policy creation and reform, and emphasis on engaging their district communities are cornerstones of their work, but these efforts do not always mitigate the pervasive nature of bias, politics and power dynamics, changes in leadership, and the emotional toll these leaders experience.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In 1995, the General Assembly of North Carolina directed the State Board of Education (SBE) to develop a restructuring plan for public education (North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, 2012). In response to the General Assembly&#x2019;s call to make bigger strides in student achievement, the SBE adopted the ABCs of Public Education&#x2014;a comprehensive plan for improving schools in the state with a focus on (a) strong accountability, (b) teaching the basics, and (c) local control (North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, 2006). In the 1996-97 school year, Princeville School was labeled as low-performing (NCDPI, 1999) and, despite a period of significant improvement in the immediate years following its initial designation, has been regularly labeled as such since 2005. Since the advent of the ABCs of Public Education, a series of reform efforts have taken place in North Carolina and in Princeville, in particular. 
      Using ethnohistorical methods coupled with oral histories, this study seeks to connect community experiences and perspectives with archival material in order to understand the degree to which the people of Princeville, NC&#x2014;America&#x2019;s oldest Black town&#x2014;have experienced these education reforms. Drawing upon reality pedagogy (Emdin, 2016) and Critical Race Theory, the research explores how oral histories serve as counternarratives (Delgado &amp; Stefancic, 2012) to the majoritarian story (Noblit &amp; Jay, 1993) of education reform.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Rebecca Dragomani: No Child Left Behind: A Quality Improvement Clinical Implementation to Improve Treatment Outcomes, Quality of Care, and Quality of Life and for Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at a Rural Primary Care Practice 
      (Under the direction of Dr. Victoria Soltis-Jarrett, PhD, RN, PMHCNS/NP-BC, FAAN)
      Background and Rationale: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) consistently report lower quality of life than their neurotypical peers and are at substantially increased risk for development of a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Fewer than half are prescribed an initial medication that is both efficacious and tolerable. Pharmacogenomic testing identifies medications likely to cause side effects and is available for use in routine clinical practice, although its effects on the quality of life among children who are prescribed medication for ADHD has not yet been evaluated. 
       Problem: Genetic differences contribute to the wide variability of response to ADHD medications but are not considered in treatment decisions. Quality of life, which correlates with the development of psychiatric comorbidities, is rarely assessed. 
       Purpose:  The project aimed to improve the quality of care, treatment outcomes, and quality of life for school-aged children with ADHD at a primary care practice by implementing a comprehensive bundle of practice changes that individualize treatment of ADHD. 
      Methodology: The impact of routine pharmacogenomic testing on the incidence of ADHD medication side effects and change in behavioral symptoms was evaluated using retrospective chart review data.  A convenience sample of 52 charts included 26 charts of patients who received pharmacogenomic testing (PGT) prior to being prescribed medication for ADHD and a second group of 26 patients who did not receive testing (No PGT). Quality of life was measured using cross-sectional data from 40 KINDL Quality-of-Life Questionnaires (parent-respondent).  Quality of care was assessed through parent interviews. 
      Results:  All QI initiatives were fully adopted. Pharmacogenomic testing was associated with fewer moderate and severe ADHD medication side effects (PGT 1.1 vs. No PGT 2.4) and greater differences in behavioral symptom scores (PGT -32 vs. NPGT -15.8). Mean quality-of-life scores of children with ADHD (PGT - 80.3, No PGT - 75.5, History Unknown 71.2) were higher than the benchmark averages. 
      Conclusion: The results support the continued use of pharmacogenomic testing prior to prescribing medication to children for ADHD, use of standardized assessments of response, and quality-of-life assessments to identify children at higher risk for the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation investigates how public information about new scientific research flows through the contemporary media system. Arguing that public science is governed more by entropy than inertia, this project investigates the people, technologies, and processes through which difference is brought into flows of information about direct detection of dark matter experiments. Over six empirical chapters, the project considers how three types of organizational mediators of public science&#x2014;multi-institution collaborations, communication offices at national laboratories, and science journalists&#x2014;translate, move, preserve, and/or deconstruct information. To do so, it draws on diverse methods, including 62 semi-structured interviews with members of these organizations and an interpretive textual analysis of hundreds of news articles, press releases, and organizational documents. This project makes three broad contributions. First, it provides a detailed account of how science organizations are adopting new practices, structures, and formats to reach new audiences amid changing technologies, economic pressures, and cultures. Second, it extends Bruno Latour&#x2019;s circulating reference to present a new descriptive and normative model of the epistemology of public science communication that acknowledges how the reduction of technical complexity can productively afford an expansion of public meaning. It argues that good public communication must shepherd the relationships and connections that allow truth to circulate across time, space, and reference, while simultaneously working to open content for public discussion, consideration, and meaning making. Finally, this project considers what happens when these mediations go wrong. Instead of mis or disinformation&#x2014;information lacking truth&#x2014;this project recognizes another form of information degradation: deformation. Deformations are structural artifacts of the contemporary media system: pieces and fragments broken off in the grinding of disparate logics, systems, technologies, and messages. They emerge when information loses its organization, its formation. Observing deformation in science and beyond, this project ultimately argues that despite decades of scholarship on the &#x201C;information society,&#x201D; ours is better recognized as the &#x201C;deformation society.&#x201D;</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The primary purpose of this study was to determine if there was a significant effect on mid-major universities&#x2019; Total Donations, Athletic-Restricted Donations, and Attendance after a Division I men&#x2019;s basketball team makes the NCAA tournament. Donation and attendance data was collected from 153 mid-major universities who made the NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball tournament at least once during 2004-05 to 2013-14. Paired samples t-tests found there was a statistically significant increase in Total Donations and Athletic-Restricted Donations the year immediately following a tournament appearance. After a school appeared in the NCAA tournament, universities saw on average a 6.8% and 10.24% increase in Total Donations and Athletic-Restricted Donations respectively.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Water supply and water quality: Putting together how natural and human factors affect these, using satellites</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation explores the interplay of human and natural factors upon water resources in the Chesapeake Bay, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and the marshes of southern Iraq. I used high-quality but expensive-to-collect fieldwork data of water status. I combined that data with regularly-produced satellite images covering large sections of the earth. Combining high-quality fieldwork data with global, continuous satellite data can produce datasets that are richer than the sum of their two parts. 
      I first studied the effect of storms on water quality in the Chesapeake Bay by using a relationship between satellite-measured red light reflectance and ground measurements of total suspended solids (TSS). This resulted in viable reflectance-TSS relationships for five major Western Shore rivers. Modeling a single reflectance-TSS relationship for the entire estuary produced poorer models with less significance compared to treating each channel separately. After studying the aftermath of 2800 rain events, I found some evidence that higher rainfall corresponds to a lower distribution of TSS concentrations one day following the storm in forested, compared to urban, watersheds.
      In chapter 2, I studied how conflicts and drought disrupt water supply on dams and barrages along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. I used a satellite-based algorithm, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), to monitor changes in the extent of surface reservoirs (1985-present). The most sudden changes in water supply occurred during conflict, but conflict was not often a cause of the greatest absolute changes to reservoir area. In chapter 3, I again used NDWI and similar algorithms to examine how the seasonal cycle of marshes at the southern end of the Tigris and Euphrates has been affected by drought, development, and conflict. I found some evidence that the yearly timing of the marsh peak size has become more variable after exposure to these stressors. 
      No matter the stressor &#x2013; from storms to drought to war &#x2013; water quality and supply are highly affected by human and natural factors. In combination with ground information, satellite data can fill in data gaps and offer further insights.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have emerged as a potentially safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Because e-cigarettes deliver nicotine without burning tobacco, their use likely confers a lower overall health risk than inhaling combustible tobacco products. However, e-cigarette emissions contain solvents (propylene glycol and glycerol), flavorings, and other additives, which have not been evaluated for inhalation toxicities. The inhalation of flavoring agents, which are frequently aldehydes, poses a significant unknown in regards to the potential health risks of e-cigarette use as many of these chemicals are structurally similar to toxic aldehydes in cigarette smoke. Furthermore, aldehyde flavoring agents are often used at exceedingly high concentrations in e-cigarettes which may lead to high exposure doses. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on evaluating the effects of flavored e-cigarettes, particularly those containing &#x237A;,&#x3B2;-unsaturated cinnamaldehyde, on respiratory innate defense mechanisms and assessing whether and how these flavorings may alter susceptibility to respiratory infections. In Chapter 2, we report that cinnamon-flavored e-cigarette refill liquids and cinnamaldehyde modify human respiratory innate immune cell defense functions, including neutrophil and alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of leukemia cells. Based on these observations we established the cinnamaldehyde exposure concentrations that inhibit normal defense functions (IC50) and induce cytotoxicity (LC50). In Chapter 3, we report that cinnamon-flavored e-liquids, cinnamon e-cigarette aerosols, and cinnamaldehyde temporarily suppress motile cilia on human bronchial epithelial cells (hBE) and that this response is driven by transient inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. In Chapter 4, we report that cinnamaldehyde, guaiacol, and eugenol elicit a dose-dependent bimodal effect on Nrf2-pathway activation in bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B) and cinnamaldehyde exposure significantly depletes cellular glutathione (GSH) levels at low micromolar concentrations. Taken together, the work presented in this dissertation demonstrates that flavoring agents, in the context of e-cigarette use, are capable of dysregulating essential respiratory defense responses, which may increase susceptibility of respiratory infections and lung disease in e-cigarette users. It is our hope that the information provided here will be useful in the development of health-protective policies aimed at reducing or eliminating harmful and potentially harmful chemicals from e-cigarettes.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different peri-workout nutrition strategies on strength, body composition, and metabolism in trained females.  Young, trained females (n=43) completed body composition and strength testing before and after training.  Participants were randomized into three groups using baseline leg press strength; pre-exercise supplementation of a protein-carbohydrate shake (PRE), post-exercise supplementation (POST), or a control group (CON).  Following baseline testing, participants were trained twice per week for six weeks using high intensity resistance training.  At the first and last training, metabolic testing was completed before and after exercise.  There were significant main effects for time for LM (p=0.003) and %fat (p&lt;0.0005).  All three groups experienced significant increases in strength.  There were no significant between groups differences for metabolic measurements (p&gt;0.05).   These results demonstrate that peri-workout nutrition is potentially important for body composition, but either a PRE or POST strategy is effective.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The United States of America has the highest incarceration rate in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population (Wagner, Sakala, &amp; Begley, 2016). While the United States represents only about 4.4 percent of the world's population, it houses around 22% of the world's prisoners (Wagner et al., 2016). Many of these adult prisoners begin their criminal history as children or young adults (Leone, Krezmien, Mason, &amp; Meisel, 2005). This study looks at how student educational engagement can be fostered so as to increase the quality of education for juvenile delinquents in order to reduce recidivism rates, thus lowering the prison population over time.
      Increasing the quality of education systems within residential juvenile justice facilities has been shown to be a critical piece of rehabilitation for juvenile delinquents. This autoethnography looks at how one teacher-researcher has worked to increase student engagement in order to increase both student motivation and achievement within one residential juvenile justice facility over four years.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Meghan Jones Degler: Practitioner Perspectives and Pedagogies in Globally-Minded World Language Educators
      (Under the direction of Jocelyn Glazier)
      Over the previous few decades, global education has become a buzzword among education researchers and practitioners mindful of the realities of a globalizing society. In these years, the field has grown to include multiple definitions and ideologies. Neoliberal ideals reflect the development of knowledge and skills for individual and corporate gain, centrist perspectives acknowledge an appreciation, awareness, and openness toward other cultures and perspectives, and liberal philosophies evidence a dedication to action and interaction in the name of social transformation. World language education literature possesses a similar ideological continuum that juxtaposes language learning for individual gain, developing awareness of cultural others, and using language skills to cross borders culturally and linguistically. To date, however, there are no empirical studies that connect these two ideologically similar fields. This project uses a collective case study design to explore the perspectives and accompanying practices of five globally-minded world language teachers who seek to incorporate global frameworks into world language instruction. Deductive coding connects teacher perspectives and practices with the existing theoretical and empirical literature on both global education and world language education. Findings in each case illustrate diverse teacher backgrounds with unique approaches to incorporating global frameworks into world language classes. Across cases, findings show a wide range of perspectives and practices, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the ideas that surround
      iv
      both fields. Implications of this study show a need for educational opportunities that help teachers connect their personal experience to their ideologies, make space for global experiences that contribute to content knowledge and teaching resources, and advocate educational policies that prioritize the incorporation of global frameworks into world language content. While the findings of this study are unique and context-dependent, they suggest that there is space in the scholarly conversation to include discussions of how world language education complements the broader goals of global education in both theory and practice.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Explaining Individual Attitudes Toward Immigration  Using Socioeconomic and Cultural Theoretical Modeling</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Two substantial and growing bodies of literature address variations in individual attitudes toward immigration from a socioeconomic and a cultural perspective, respectively. Fewer studies, however, seek to reconcile these theoretical perspectives through a more holistic approach. With that in mind, this paper is conceived with an appreciation for explaining immigration attitude formation as a complex web of deeply interconnected factors which vary widely in importance among individuals. I argue that, in addition to socioeconomic factors, cultural elements play an even stronger role in the formation of public opinion toward immigration on an individual level. In particular, I use quantitative analysis of European Social Survey (2014) data to separate the effects of prejudicial views from the effects of cultural fears which are responsible for a substantial amount of opposition to immigration in Europe.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper examines an interracial labor organizing project in the Southern pulpwood processing industry. The project was organized by two white former members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in response to the organization&#x2019;s directive that white activists conduct antiracist organizing in white communities.  It was ultimately funded by the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF). GROW&#x2019;s strategy was to convince poor white Southerners of their common interests with black Southerners through labor organizing and, in turn, to transform their racial attitudes. Due to the successes of the classical civil rights movement, including the Voting Rights and Civil Rights Acts, as well as the mobilization of white antiracist activists, the project succeeded in building interracial coalitions and winning modest gains for pulpwood haulers. This paper joins existing 1970s labor and New Left historiography while also interrogating the historiography of civil rights unionism and interracial coalition building in the Deep South.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>IKK FAMILY KINASES REGULATE CELL GROWTH, METABOLISM AND AUTOPHAGY BY PHOSPHORYLATION OF KEY SUBSTRATES</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Inflammation is now widely accepted to be an essential mediator of the balance between cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. A group of kinases belonging to the IB kinase (IKK) family has emerged as critical regulators of the interplay between inflammation and energy usage in both healthy and diseased tissues. They accomplish this task by phosphorylation of a variety of protein targets. My dissertation work has focused on two of these phosphorylation targets.
       In Chapter 2, I characterized the role of IKK in regulating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the primary sensor of ATP levels in a cell. I found that IKK directly phosphorylates Thr172 within the AMPK activation loop, both basally in cancer cell lines and in response to cytokine stimulation. Thr172 phosphorylation of AMPK is well-characterized to increase the activity of AMPK and to phosphorylation of downstream AMPK targets. By understanding the mechanism of IKK-mediated AMPK activation, I was able to devise a strategy for exploiting a metabolic weakness of LKB1 deficient lung cancers, which involved combining an IKK inhibitor with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor phenformin. In Chapter 3, I characterized the mechanism whereby the IKK-related kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylated a critical component of mTORC1, Raptor, which could represent a mechanism whereby TBK1 promotes autophagy. 
      Overall, the work presented here adds to our understanding of the mechanisms of how inflammation can regulate metabolism. Knowledge of these mechanisms will hopefully shed new light on ways to therapeutically restrict the metabolic changes induced by inflammation for therapeutic benefit.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Though there is a body of research that deconstructs essentialized perspectives on Latinx youth (Cervantes-Soon, 2012; 2017; Cammarota, 2008; 2011; Denner &amp; Guzman, 2006; Garcia, 2012: Stanton-Salazar, 2001; Valdes, 2001; Valenzuela, 1999) a large body of research has failed to perceive Latina girls in nuanced ways. Additionally, mainstream research and broader discourses on Latina adolescents have been dominated by a hyper-focus on the &#x201C;problem of [Latinx] adolescent behavior&#x201D; (Akom, Cammarota, &amp; Ginwright, 2008, p. 1). In the face of this, however, Chicana and Latina feminist writers use academic research and narrative writing to testify against deficit portrayals of Latinas. However, a review of these works has also spotlighted the reality that even this critical body of work has ignored the wisdoms and lived experiences of Latina youth. There has been much work that focuses on the perspectives of adult women who tend to look back to their youth in order to make sense of their adulthood. Conversely, this research age-gap has elucidated the importance of youth experiences and the need to for nuanced scholarship that centers their experiential knowledge.The absence of Latina youth voices is even more conspicuous when we take context into account as their voices are also largely absent from the growing number of work on the New Latinx South. Historically, Latinx communities have been absent from the demographic, economic, cultural, and political systems of the South but in the past two decades, there has been a profound shift in new immigration gateway states like North Carolina (Smith &amp; Furuseth, 2006). This migration has disrupted the Southern socio-political consciousness that has largely been defined by the Black/White racial dichotomy (Wortham, Murrillo, &amp; Hamann, 2002). 
        Drawing from Chicana feminist theory, testimonio, and Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain's (1998) sociocultural practice theory of identity and agency, this student presents a narrative about surveillance and counter-surveillance in the New Latinx South. Drawing from the encuentros, interview data, and observational data, I have identified three domains of surveillance. The first, surveillance of citizenship, refers to how racist nativist discourses about Latinx immigrants create a surveillance system in the form immigration retenes, heightened anti-immigrant sentiments amongst the students, and school&#x2019;s silence around these very issues. The second type of surveillance, surveillance of the flesh, refers to the raced-gendered discourses of power that situate the girls&#x2019; emerging womanhood as inherently dangerous to themselves and others. The third surveillance finding, surveillance of student identity refers to the institutional patrolling (Alvarez-Gutierrez, 2014) practices of school personnel the closely monitor Latina bodies within the school. This monitoring presents itself through the push for visibility and compliance, the standards driven curriculum, and racialized constructs of intelligence. Through that awareness comes a responsibility to recognize that while the girls were being watched, they were also watching back by engaging in their own forms of counter-surveillance. As such, this study also points to moments when the girls deployed their facultades and border thinking (Mignolo, 2000) in order to disrupt the panoptic gaze and discourses of power imposed on them. I characterize this action as &#x201C;counter-surveillance.&#x201D; Implications for the theorization of pedagogies and literacies are discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The development of infant sleep is thought to be jointly guided by the dual processes of sleep consolidation and regulation. However, until now, there have been few empirical studies testing whether there is evidence for these latent processes. The current study uses structural equation modeling to test whether sleep consolidation and regulation can be modeled by two distinct latent variables. Using observed indicators from multiple sleep assessment methods, we found that a two factor model representing the processes of consolidation and regulation fit better than a one factor, undifferentiated model. These two latent factors were predicted by different intrinsic (i.e., infant) and extrinsic (i.e., parenting) factors, as well as interactions between the two classes of predictors. Specifically, we replicated the interaction of infant temperament and maternal emotional availability in predicting both consolidation and regulation. We also found that infant sleep regulation longitudinally predicted infant attention regulation, although this relationship was only true for children whose mothers held a college degree or higher. These findings contribute to the literature by providing a novel measurement model that appropriately accounts for measurement error. Further, our findings suggest that considering the interaction between child characteristics and parental input in promoting high quality sleep is a key avenue for future research. Finally, by partially replicating sleep-cognition linkages previously observed in adolescents and adults, we find support for the notion of hierarchically organized self-regulatory abilities, which motivates areas for future investigation and possible intervention.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 3 (GRK3) REGULATES G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS ON MURINE BONE MARROW NICHE MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS AND HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-PROGENITOR CELLS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The bone marrow microenvironment, termed niche, supports hematopoietic cell development and thus, is vital for establishment of the immune system. Within the niche reside bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BmMSCs) that surround the hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) to support their development, maintenance, and function; however, the intracellular regulatory mechanisms of BmMSCs and HSPCs are still being defined. The goal of this dissertation work is to provide further insight into the regulatory mechanisms that modulate functionality of BmMSCs and HSPCs. Our data suggest G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) functions as a negative regulator of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on BmMSCs and HSPCs.
      BmMSCs isolated from GRK3-deficient (Grk3-/-) mice have enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ex vivo compared to wildtype (WT) BmMSCs. Grk3-/- BmMSC cultures also have higher levels of CXCL12, an essential chemokine for HSPC development, and interestingly, Grk3-/- mice have increased hematopoietic cell numbers isolated from the bone marrow. Both Grk3-/- BmMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were reduced to WT level upon reduction of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and Grk3-/- BmMSCs have sustained ERK1/2 signaling upon stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) with S1P in comparison to WT BmMSCs. In addition, we report GRK3 recruits &#x3B2;-arrestin, a protein necessary for receptor internalization, to the C-terminus of S1PR1, and we demonstrate BmMSCs lacking GRK3 regulation have impaired S1PR1 internalization. Our findings suggest GRK3 regulates GPCR S1PR on BmMSCs.
      Grk3-/- mice have increased bone marrow lineage negative (Lin-) Sca1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) HSPC and oligopotent progenitor numbers, as well as increased total leukocytes in the peripheral blood. Since increased stem cell numbers and function potentiate cellular engraftment and hematopoiesis, we tested whether GRK3 deficiency enhances hematopoietic cell function in vivo after short-term transplantation, termed colony forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) assay. Transplanted Grk3-/- LSK HSPCs or Grk3-/- whole bone marrow increases colony counts on the explanted spleen in comparison to WT controls, suggesting hematopoiesis of Grk3-/- HSPC is enhanced. Further, both Grk3-/- hematopoietic myeloid granulocytic and monocytic (CFU-GM) and lymphoid (CFU-Pre-B) colony counts increased ex vivo upon CXCR4 ligand stimulation (CXCL12), and Grk3-/- myeloid colony counts reduced to WT levels with CXCR4 antagonist treatment (AMD3100). Taken together, in vivo and ex vivo CFU data suggest GRK3 regulates bone marrow HSPC numbers, and this is, at least in part, mediated through CXCL12/CXCR4 stimulation.
      Herein, we describe a newly elucidated pathway of regulation on two niche cells, BmMSCs and HSPCs. Specifically, our data suggest GRK3 functions as a negative regulator of GPCRs on both BmMSCs and HSPCs and can modulate stem cell function.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcome of the Resilon/Epiphany TM obturation system and to determine if Resilon differed in healing. In part 1, 125 teeth were radiographically evaluated using Orstavik's PAI; 80 treated with Resilon and 45 with gutta percha. Age, gender, tooth position and number of months to follow up were documented and a multivariate analysis was performed. Resilon treated teeth were more likely to have a lesion at follow up when compared to gutta percha (p=0.009). Teeth presenting with pre-operative lesions, regardless of material used, were also more likely to present with a lesion at follow up (p=0.04). In part 2, 38 subjects were clinically evaluated. Bivariate analysis showed no difference in any clinical signs between Resilon and gutta percha and placement of a final restoration within 3 months of root canal completion, regardless of material, was beneficial (p=0.047).</dc:description>

          <dc:title>IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EVIDENCE-BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO PROMOTE THE CORRECT USE OF A SUBDERMAL CONTRACEPTIVE IMPLANT IN WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: Unintended pregnancy remains one of the top problems women face across the United States, although the rate has decreased 18% in four years due to an increase in the use highly effective long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), specifically the subdermal implant. However, irregular or prolonged bleeding is the most common side effect associated with the subdermal implant and primary cause for early removal. Proper provider education on the management of side effects of the implant may improve how women tolerate the implant, decreasing rates of early removal.
      Purpose: The purpose of this project was to implement a system wide educational program for providers and staff at a local health department on optimizing counseling patients about the subdermal contraceptive implant to improve provider knowledge and decrease early removal rates. 
      Methods: A quasi-experimental design based on Lippitt&#x2019;s seven step theory was used to test the impact of a system wide educational intervention for providers on identifying irregular vaginal bleeding and potential treatments, and provision of provider contact information for patients receiving the subdermal implant. An informational brochure was also created as a tool for patients, and staff were educated on how to utilize the tool during patient encounters for implant insertion. Implementation consisted of education during in-person meetings with all staff members. Records of patients between January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 were randomly reviewed retrospectively and a 3-month post implementation chart review was conducted for comparison with pre-intervention data.  
      Results: The current project indicated the system wide educational intervention for providers and staff on optimizing counseling patients on the subdermal contraceptive implant and its common side-effects in females of childbearing age elicited a statistically significant change in knowledge among clinic staff at the NRC (Wilcoxon signed-ranked z = -2.371, p = 0.018). There was also a significant impact on the number of subdermal implants removed (p = 0.015) between pre and post implementation of the education program.
      Conclusion: Implementation of a system wide educational program led to improved staff knowledge regarding evidence-based counseling for subdermal contraceptive implants. Based on these findings, standardizing provider-led education to counsel female patients on the subdermal contraceptive implant can lead to effective treatment of common side effects and reduce early discontinuation rates, ultimately preventing unwanted pregnancy.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>INVESTIGATIONS OF ANNEALING EFFECTS ON STRONTIUM TITANATE ELECTRODES FOR APPLICATION AS BARE AND DYE-SENSITIZED PHOTOANODES IN PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) that catalyze the water-splitting reaction with solar energy have been proposed as an alternative to electrolysis of water. The electrodes for these cells must have particular qualities with regards to electrochemical stability, dielectric
      properties, optical bandgap, and position of band edges to create a functioning PEC. Finding a material that satisfies all of these requirements is challenge. Here we consider strontium titanate as a photoanode for these cells and attempt to modify these electrodes to have optimum properties for this application.
      Strontium titanate has been considered as a photoelectrode for PECs and dyesensitized solar cells because of its electrochemical stability. Its resistivity, band gap, and band edge positions are not ideal for these devices leading many investigators to attempt a wide variety of modifications to improve their performance. One common alteration is to anneal strontium titanate electrodes in a variety of atmospheres and temperatures. A significant amount of work has studied the effects of anneals on strontium titanate but a systematic study on how changes in annealing conditions effect the photoelectrochemical performance of bare and dye-sensitized strontium titanate photoelectrodes is absent from the literature. In this work the effects of annealing atmosphere and temperature on strontium titante film electrodes are evaluated in the context of their application as PEC and dyesensitized PEC photoanodes.
      Strontium titante films were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition. Spectroscopic techniques used for this study include x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. These techniques are combined with a
      variety of electrochemical measurements to evaluate the photoanodes. Electrochemical measurements included controlled potential techniques, transient absorption spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A spectroelectrochemical technique for measuring density of states was attempted but did not yield significant results. A rotating ring-disk electrode setup was used to evaluate the faradaic efficiency of the electrode with the best performance.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Socioeconomic position (SEP) and acculturation have been identified as two salient factors for Latino mental health. These factors may change and accumulate over multiple generations and within neighborhoods, especially among Latino populations. However, existing literature examining the mental health effects of SEP and acculturation is limited to examination of individual-level variables within a single generation. The role of the accumulation of socioeconomic and cultural factors across generations and within neighborhoods in shaping Latino mental health remains virtually unexplored. Linking data from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging, the Ni&#xF1;os Lifestyle &amp; Diabetes Study, and 2000 US Census, this dissertation addressed three gaps in our understanding of depression etiology: the association of (1) socioeconomic and (2) acculturation trajectories across generations with depressive symptoms; and (3) the association of neighborhood cultural factors with depressive symptoms.
      Overall, our study populations had a high depressive symptom prevalence comparable to that of larger, more representative samples of US Latinos. Our results suggested that intergenerational and community-level factors may play a role in this high prevalence. Firstly, we found that compared to stable-low educational mobility, stable-high education and upward educational mobility were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Downwardly mobile participants also had slightly fewer depressive symptoms compared to stable-low participants. Secondly, decreased Spanish use and stable-equal English/Spanish use across generations appeared to protect against depressive symptoms in offspring, compared to stable-high Spanish use. Notably, stable-low Spanish use across generations did not confer a mental health benefit. Finally, we found a strong positive association between neighborhood cultural segregation measures and depressive symptoms that was attenuated toward the null upon adjustment for individual-level education. Overall our study suggests the importance of access to educational resources across generations and within neighborhoods in addition to exposure to cultural heritage and ties for Latino mental health. 
      Our study highlights the importance of collecting and examining data regarding how socioeconomic and cultural contexts change across generations and accumulate within communities to impact depression in minority populations. This dissertation contributes to a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of depression etiology and the dynamic community and intergenerational pathways that shape Latino mental health.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Caring for the world&#x2019;s more than 150 million orphans and separated children (OSC) is a global priority. Current polices advocate deinstitutionalization, but recent evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) shows similar outcomes in institution-based and family-based care settings. We used data from the longitudinal POFO cohort of OSC from five LMICs to examine the effects of transitioning OSC from institution-based care to family-based care on incident abuse, emotional difficulties, and cognitive functioning among institution-based OSC.  We characterized the familial adult structure among family-based OSC, and assessed associations between changes in that structure and wellbeing outcomes.
      Among the 1,194 institution-based OSC in Aim 1, we found a small effect of transitioning from institution-based care to family-based care on incident abuse (risk ratio (RR):  1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.58, 2.43; risk difference (RD): 0.01; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.05), a slight decrease in cognitive functioning (mean difference: -0.96 ; 95% CI: -2.17, 0.25) and a slight increase in emotional difficulties (mean difference: 0.24 ; 95% CI:-0.91, 1.39).  For the 1,357 family-based OSC in Aim 2, up to 61.2% reported living with a mother, 12.9% with a father, and 45.4% with a grandmother during follow-up. Approximately 60% experienced at least 1 change in their familial adult structure over follow-up. Cumulative changes in the structure were not associated with incident abuse or cognitive functioning, but more changes were associated with a small increase in emotional difficulties (1 change: mean difference 0.23, 95% CI:-0.33, 0.79; 2 changes: mean difference: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.00, 1.16; &#x2265;3 changes: mean difference: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.29).
      Global deinstitutionalization policies may not confer the presumed benefits of reductions in abuse and improved cognitive functioning, but the disruption may increase emotional difficulties. Changes in the adult familial structure for family-based OSC are not uncommon, and are associated with emotional difficulties.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Cell cycle is a tightly regulated process; however, it is mis-regulated in many cancers, leading to increased proliferation. Our lab is interested in better understanding cell cycle regulation, in particular, regulation by the ubiquitin system, which controls targeted protein degradation. The following work focuses on the modular ubiquitin E3 ligase composed of SKP1/CUL1/F-box protein (SCF) with its substrate adapter Cyclin F. Cyclin F is a unique F-box protein in that it is highly cell cycle regulated, and has been revealed as a key regulator of cell cycle progression despite few of its substrates having been identified. Our lab aims to identify novel Cyclin F substrates, and determine how these substrates regulate cell cycle processes.
      The Cyclin F substrate, Nucleolar and Spindle Associated Protein 1 (NUSAP1), is a microtubule binding protein implicated in mitotic spindle stability and chromosome segregation, however, how it functions is unknown. I have identified a novel interaction between NUSAP1 and a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase composed of Ran Binding Protein 2 (RanBP2), Ran GTPase Activating Protein 1 (RanGAP1) and the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, UBC9. This work provides evidence that NUSAP1 may function in the SUMO pathway to promote faithful chromosome segregation.
      Cell cycle and metabolic regulation are critical to the growth and proliferation of normal cells, and these systems can be rewired in cancer to promote proliferation. Better understanding how these processes are integrated could provide key insights into how cancers proliferate. The following work identifies Sirtuin 5, a mitochondrial deacylating enzyme, as a novel Cyclin F substrate. Sirtuin 5 is a known regulator of key metabolic processes including gluconeogenesis and urea production, among others. To date, identified Cyclin F substrates are all involved in significant cell cycle processes, however, Sirtuin 5 has never been connected to cell cycle. This data reveals a new role for Sirtuin 5 as a regulator of G1 progression and suggests a possible role in quiescence. Furthermore, this data provides a link between cell cycle progression and metabolism. Additional research is needed to understand what possible metabolites are involved in this regulation, and how it is mis-regulated in cancer.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: This dissertation focused on designing hypertension self-management visualizations that facilitate patient comprehension of blood pressure and medication adherence information. The objectives of this research were to: 1) assess patient preferences and understanding of visualization features; 2) assess whether condensing the display of blood pressure and medication adherence information into a single visualization improves patient comprehension of the inferred relationship between medication adherence and blood pressure control (compared to separate visualizations); 3) assess whether health literacy moderates the effect of condensed visualizations on comprehension; and 4) assess the validity and reliability of a newly developed hypertension-related visualization comprehension scale.
      Methods: Patients with hypertension (n=6) participated in user assessments to understand preferences for visualization features. Another sample of patients with hypertension (n=6) participated in cognitive interviews that assessed understanding of visualizations that incorporated patient preferences. A survey experiment with patients with hypertension (n=137) then assessed whether condensed visualizations improved comprehension of blood pressure and medication adherence information. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the main effect of visualization type (condensed versus separate display) on comprehension, and the moderating effect of health literacy on comprehension. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of the comprehension scale.  
      Results: Patients preferred visualizations with blue/orange color-coded culturally recognizable symbols to show medication adherence, and the use of labeled blood pressure data points, horizontal reference lines, and a shaded &#x201C;normal&#x201D; blood pressure zone. Patients best understood a shaded &#x201C;normal&#x201D; blood pressure zone with color-coded symbols to show medication adherence. Condensed visualizations did not significantly improve comprehension, and health literacy did not moderate the relationship between visualization type and comprehension. However, greater health literacy (B=0.61, p=.0001) and hypertension knowledge (B=0.10, p&lt;0.0001) were positively associated with comprehension. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a unidimensional 4-item solution for the comprehension scale. 
      Conclusion: This study is an important step in developing useful and useable data visualizations for self-managing HTN. Condensed-display visualizations did not improve patient comprehension of BP and medication adherence information. Future research should further investigate how to design visualizations that improve comprehension, specifically for patients with low health literacy.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Hip Hop Illiterate: Hermeneutics for the Future of American Literary Theory and Criticism</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation puts the critical reading practices and aesthetic techniques of the hip hop emcee at the center of a millennial theory of American literature and cultural criticism. While many disciplines have integrated aspects of hip hop culture into their fields of study, the distance maintained between traditional English literature departments and hip hop&#x2019;s deep literary archive has generated gaps for literature scholars to fill. In contrast to earlier work that emphasized the emcee&#x2019;s lyrics as an extension of conventional Western poetics, this dissertation demonstrates how emcees create their own theories of reading and literacy, alongside practices of critical interpretation and evaluation, which teach scholars how to read and interpret more canonical literary texts. 
      Through a series of suggestive close readings positioning hip hop concept albums as a novel form of literary production, the dissertation sets prominent emcees in critical conversation with acknowledged American writers, arguing that all these authors imagine a future American literature (and by extension, a future America) by first sounding the nation differently. In reading hip hop&#x2019;s shifting concepts of literature and interpretation as transformative of the role of the literary critic in the new millennium, I conclude with a brief consideration of the future of literary and hip hop studies. 
      Specifically, using methods informed by Foucauldian discourse analysis and critical historiography, each chapter precedes by showing how the hip hop emcee cultivates aesthetic practices in conversation with earlier American literary and critical texts, building on techniques first explored in works like My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), The Souls of Black Folk (1903), Jonah&#x2019;s Gourd Vine (1933), Mules and Men (1935), and The Color Purple (1982). Ultimately, the project puts these canonical texts in critical dialogue with a number of self-consciously literary moments in hip hop, focusing on the emergence of a new genre of literature production, as seen in the emergence of hip hop concept albums the likes of Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x2019;s Paid in Full (1987), Lauryn Hill&#x2019;s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), and Nas&#x2019;s Untitled album (2008). Through the comparative reading of these hip hop albums and canonical black authors, the project considers how shifting the concepts of authority, expertise, literacy, reception, and literature away from the printed page expands the responsibilities of the literary critic and the possibilities for future literary studies. 
      My introduction begins by meditating on the dichotomy between the concepts of literacy and illiteracy, particularly as the former gets deployed for the purpose of standardizing what comes to constitute literature for study in the American academy. By exploring the early-twentieth century American folkloric tale, &#x201C;How to Write a Letter,&#x201D; as related by Zora Neale Hurston in Mules and Men (1935), I theorize the contours for developing a literary hermeneutics based in hip hop&#x2019;s aesthetics as a function of the fragmentation of the dichotomy between literates and illiterates exposed in the emergence of the hip hop concept album and in the pervasive horizon point of the American emcee&#x2019;s literary influence.
      In chapter one, I recoup a literary genealogy of the emcee that predates hip hop&#x2019;s cultural emergence in America in the 1970s. Turning to W. E. B. Du Bois&#x2019;s well-known critical text, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), and a lesser known reflection in his writings, &#x201C;My Country &#x2018;Tis of Thee&#x201D; (1907), the chapter explores Du Bois&#x2019;s use of paratextual selection and revisions and redeployments of his previously published work as a prototypical style of sampling and remixing characterized in the techniques of hip hop production. I examine these structural procedures in Du Bois&#x2019;s writing in order to consider their centrality to American literary aesthetics and to track their development as a trope for sounding racial difference in the literary texts that inform American cultural belonging. 
      The second chapter investigates the idea of love as a critical legacy of black feminist thought and womanist theory by offering a critical reading of Lauryn Hill and the reception of her debut solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). In the process of mapping Hill&#x2019;s location and embodiment in and outside of hip hop, the chapter offers a comparative reading of the critical debate chronicled in the 1987 issue of New Literary History between Joyce A. Joyce, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and Houston Baker, Jr. regarding the viability of love as a theoretical concept to build African American literary theory and criticism in the 1990s. This comparative reading considers what is really at stake when love is positioned at the margins of literature scholarship and outside the domain of hip hop, working to read Lauryn Hill&#x2019;s reception as an updated response to June Jordan&#x2019;s question, &#x201C;Where is the Love?&#x201D; from her seminal 1978 essay of that same name. 
      My final chapter takes up the question of how shifting the concepts of literature and literary criticism ultimately effect and transform the role of the literary critic in the twenty-first century. Interrogating notions of critical authority and expertise, I look specifically at Nas&#x2019;s Untitled ninth studio album (formerly titled the Nigger album) and the controversy surrounding its release in 2008. Calling to mind Jonathan Culler&#x2019;s invocation of hip hop in his introduction to the PMLA&#x2019;s 2010 Special Topic issue, &#x201C;Literary Criticism for the Twenty-First century,&#x201D; my chapter juxtaposes the &#x2018;disciplinary training&#x2019; of literature experts at the second-half of the twentieth century with an analysis of black expressivity and American trafficking in racial stereotype in antebellum times. I showcase Nas&#x2019;s meditation on the concept of &#x2018;nigger&#x2019; as a &#x2018;floating signifier&#x2019; of American culture and ultimately read the emcee&#x2019;s attempts to engage the slur critically in ways that rethink and rework Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s earlier literary destabilizations of the myths surrounding the slave as subject in My Bondage and My Freedom (1855).
             
      In the conclusion, I revisit many of the arguments made throughout the dissertation, adding a reflection on how I came to write this project as a reaction to the spoken-word poet Saul Williams&#x2019;s 2009 performance of The Dead Emcee Scrolls: The Lost Teachings of Hip Hop (2006) as part of the Carolina Performing Art Center&#x2019;s spring concert series. The conclusion meditates on the institutionalization of hip hop studies, allowing that although many academics have authored, edited, and led major studies and departments contributing to the expanding field, no scholarly works have taken an approach that emphasizes the genre&#x2019;s possibility for developing literary hermeneutics. Ultimately, Hip Hop Illiterate concludes by speculating about the possibilities of its theoretical framework and grammar for the future of literary analysis, highlighting how an analysis based on the hermeneutic practices of the American hip hop emcee suggests new possibilities for the future of American literary studies.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a growing need to understand large networks and to devise effective strategies to analyze them. In this dissertation, our main objectives are to understand various structural properties of large networks under suitable general framework and develop general techniques to analyze important network models arising from applied fields of study.
      In the first part of this dissertation, we investigate properties of large networks that satisfy certain local conditions. In particular, we show that if the number of neighbors of each vertex and co-neighbors of each pair of vertices satises certain conditions then the number of copies of moderately large subgraphs is approximately same as that of an Erdos-Renyi random graph with appropriate edge density. We apply our results to different graph ensembles including exponential random graph models (ERGMs), thresholded graphs from high-dimensional correlation networks, Erdos-Renyi random graphs conditioned on large cliques and random d-regular graphs.
      In the second part of this dissertation, we study models of weighted exponential random graphs in the large network limit. These models have recently been proposed to model weighted network data arising from a host of applications including socio-econometric data such as migration flows and neuroscience. We derive limiting results for the structure of these models as the number of nodes goes to infinity. We also derive sucient conditions for continuity of functionals in the specification of the model including conditions on nodal covariates.
      Finally, we study site percolation on a class of non-regular graphs satisfying some mild assumptions on the number of neighbors of each vertex and co-neighbors of each pair of vertices. We show that there is a sharp phase transition (in site percolation) for the class of graphs under consideration and that in the supercritical regime the giant component is unique.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Parallel to the world's rising urbanization trend, shifting patterns of large wet weather disturbances - more specifically, hurricanes - are raising concerns in coastal areas where many cities are located. A shift in studying these occurrences is paramount. This thesis addresses the following question: in what ways can the inclusion of social vulnerability studies and environmental justice, often developed outside of the field of urban ecology, contribute to a critical understanding of urban socioecological uncertainties following hurricanes? To answer this question, this thesis reviews the literature on urban ecology and examines how scholarship that emphasizes justice, vulnerabilities, and spatialities can expand the field's applicability to the study of natural disasters. In this thesis, I make claims for a critical urban ecology, which includes an integrated, holistic, and critical understanding of the social, economic, biogeophysical, and built parts of urban systems.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Relationships among Uncertainty, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, and Quality of Life in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Survivors</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Approximately 75% of patients who are newly diagnosed with bladder cancer present with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). NMIBC survivors have unique chronic burdens, including frequent recurrences, repeated surveillance cystoscopies and treatments, and the highest lifetime medical cost per person among all cancers. Hence, the aim of conducting this study was to (1) examine the prevalence of uncertainty, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS), and quality of life (QOL) in NMIBC survivors, (2) identify factors associated with uncertainty, PTSS, and QOL, and (3) explore the relationships among uncertainty, PTSS, and QOL. 
      This dissertation consists of three manuscripts. The first is a systematic review of the literature on QOL in NMIBC survivors. The second and third manuscripts comprise the findings from a population-based survey study in North Carolina. The data from 376 NMIBC survivors were used for the analysis. The NMIBC survivors had urinary and bowel symptoms, sexual problems, and worries about the future, regardless of time since diagnosis. The lower cancer stage at diagnosis was associated with better QOL in several domains, including global health status, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, fatigue, dyspnea, and financial difficulties. Male survivors had better sexual function and enjoyment than females, but also higher discomfort with sexual intimacy and more concerns about contaminating their partners. The cystectomy group had worse sexual function, more discomfort with sexual intimacy, lower sexual enjoyment, and more male sexual problems than the non-cystectomy group. The NMIBC survivors had notable burdens of cancer-related uncertainty, and higher uncertainty was associated with males, lower income, the lack of cure, lower cognition-ability, and higher cognition-general concerns. The prevalence of PTSS (28.7 %) was higher than in the general United States (US) adult population (10-20%). Higher PTSS were associated with younger age, lack of cure, more comorbidities, less social support, and more cognition-general concerns. Uncertainty was significantly and negatively associated with QOL, and PTSS completely mediated the effect of uncertainty on QOL. 
      The findings of this dissertation highlight the importance of assessment and management of uncertainty and PTSS in the NMIBC population. Further studies are needed to better understand NMIBC survivors&#x2019; unique needs and to develop supportive care interventions for them.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The Protogeometric period on Crete, generally the 10th and 9th centuries BCE, was characterized by a change in settlement patterns from small settlement clusters in Late Minoan IIIC to larger culture-regions defined by centralized and nucleated settlements linked to increasingly defined territories. Understanding the meaning of these changes in spatial structures and social organization, and their impact on later settlement patterns of the Cretan Early Iron Age requires a finer analytical scale and narrower temporal framework. It is, however, a necessary part of moving away from reductive historicizing narratives of palatial collapse or polis development prevalent in scholarship on Early Iron Age settlement development. Instead, reconstructing the material ways in which culture-regions were defined over the course of the Protogeometric period and beyond allows us to consider new approaches for tracking the early development of polities normally predicated on historical paradigms. 
        This project gathers the published evidence for the Cretan Protogeometric period in order to develop new models for visualizing ways in which deliberately-constructed relationships between communities in shifting settlement systems acted as mechanisms for the definition of culture-regions. The &#x201C;adherent model&#x201D; suggests that communities that closely adhered to Late Minoan IIIC settlements and cemeteries through the re-use of older habitation sites for ritualized activities, such as burial or feasting, remained highly localized and organized according to close kinship ties for much of the Early Iron Age. In contrast, the &#x201C;nucleated model&#x201D; predicts a system in which communities abandoned Late Minoan IIIC sites over the course of the Protogeometric period and developed larger corporate groups at an earlier date. These models ascribe different relative rates of social cohesion to different spatial patterns at the regional and site levels. The usefulness of the adherent model for visualizing the spatial and cultural dimension of social change within communities over the course of the Early Iron Age is further explored through a series of case studies that examine differential patterns of mobility in habitation and ritual spaces. Case studies from the Kavousi region and Knossos underpin major parts of the discussion of these archaeologically visible patterns and their intersections with historical narratives.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including pesticides, plasticizers, and personal care products that accumulate in wastewater, are exogenous chemicals that can alter hormonal regulation and gene transcription, in part by mimicking natural hormones and binding to receptors. Environmental EDC exposures can cause profound effects for humans, ranging from breast, prostate, and lung cancer to obesity and infertility. Some epidemiological studies indicate disinfection by-products (DBPs), formed during drinking water treatment, could cause similar adverse health effects.  A more complete assessment of endocrine active DBP structural classes and the remediation of known EDCs from wastewater are required. This dissertation identifies EDCs of concern in drinking water and evaluates the removal of estrogenic activity from wastewater using a combination of chemical and biochemical techniques. 
      Using receptor-binding assays and in silico molecular docking, the binding affinity of 21 DBPs were tested individually and in binary mixtures at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 2 mM for their affinity to the human estrogen alpha and chimp androgen receptor. 14 DBPs were found to bind to the androgen receptor, at IC50 values in the range of 1.86 mM for 2,3-dichloropropionamide to 13.5 &#x3BC;M for 3,4,5,6-tetrachloro-benzoquinone, and were predicted to adopt the antagonist conformation. For the estrogen receptor, 9 of the 21 DBPs were able to bind weakly, with affinities ranging from IC50 values of 1.44 mM for dibromoacetonitrile to 148 &#x3BC;M for bromopicrin, which was contrary to in silico predictions that showed a low probability of binding. In binary mixtures, the DBPs followed concentration addition for both receptors. 
      The yeast estrogen screen (YES) was then used to evaluate remediation of estrogenic activity in a simulated vertical flow filtration on-site wastewater treatment system. A laboratory-scale column study of dose loading intervals of 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48h free flowing and 8h saturated conditions showed higher removal of target anthropogenic chemicals and estrogenic activity with decreasing dose intervals. Moreover, higher levels of activity in the treated wastewater were measured by the YES assay than explained by the chemical concentrations. These results highlight the utility of complementary chemical and biological analyses for studying the effects of treatment on wastewater quality.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In 2016, the Chicago Cubs won the World Series, and for the first time in Cubs&#x2019; fans&#x2019; lives, they were champions.  This study sought to understand the effects of a 1st time championship without the bias of expectations from previous success on various demographic groups.
        The resulting exploratory research paper utilized the Cubs&#x2019; win as a natural experiment.  A total of 202 fans responded to an online survey placed on Cubs fan sites on social media.   Among other results, data analysis indicated that team identification was significant in affecting a fan&#x2019;s propensity to BIRG and predicted nearly five percent of the variance in the propensity to BIRG.  Overall, the included factors were successfully able to predict 8% of the variance in propensity to BIRG. This study shined a light on what factors may predict BIRGing behaviors on a group of fans that have finally celebrated a long-awaited championship.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Using new data from the Panama Papers, I find investors and banks undermine regulation clamping down on foreign tax evasion by establishing opaque legal structures in tax havens.  However, this concealment strategy is only effective when investors view their offshore bank as a reliable evasion partner.  When they believe offshore banks will violate their trust and cooperate with the tax authorities, investors make fewer incorporations and increase closures of offshore entities.  My study provides a rare direct look at investors' and banks' actions taken to increase opacity and informs debate on international cooperation to combat offshore tax evasion.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>RUNTIME METHODS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN SUPERCOMPUTING APPLICATIONS</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Energy efficiency in supercomputing is critical to limit operating costs and carbon footprints. While the energy efficiency of future supercomputing centers needs to improve at all levels, the energy consumed by the processing units is a large fraction of the total energy consumed by High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. HPC applications use a parallel programming paradigm like the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to coordinate computation and communication among thousands of processors. With dynamically-changing factors both in hardware and software affecting energy usage of processors, there exists a need for power monitoring and regulation at runtime to achieve savings in energy.
      This dissertation highlights an adaptive runtime framework that enables processors with core-specific power control by dynamically adapting to workload characteristics to reduce power with little or no performance impact. Two opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of processors running MPI applications are identified - computational workload imbalance and waiting on memory. Monitoring of performance and power regulation is performed by the framework transparently within the MPI runtime system, eliminating the need for code changes to MPI applications. The effect of enforcing power limits (capping) on processors is also investigated.
      Experiments on 32 nodes (1024 cores) show that in presence of workload imbalance, the runtime reduces Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency on cores not on the critical path, thereby reducing power and hence energy usage without deteriorating performance. Using this runtime, six MPI mini-applications and a full MPI application show an overall 20% decrease in energy use with less than 1% increase in execution time. In addition, the lowering of frequency on non-critical cores reduces run-to-run performance variation and improves performance. For the full application, an average speedup of 11% is seen, while the power is lowered by about 31% for an energy savings of up to 42%. Another experiment on 16 nodes (256 cores) that are power capped also shows performance improvement along with power reduction. Thus, energy optimization can also be a performance optimization. For applications that are limited by memory access times, memory metrics identified facilitate lowering of power by up to 32% without adversely impacting performance.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The hallmark characteristic of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a decline in cartilage health. Weight gain increases joint stress and is a primary risk factor for OA. The purpose of this study was to compare the change in femoral articular cartilage cross- sectional area (&#x394;CSA) following a non-weighted versus weighted walking protocol, and to determine the association between &#x394;CSA and QBM. &#x394;CSA was measured using a diagnostic ultrasound before and after walking. We found no significant difference in &#x394;CSA between conditions. QBM was not associated with &#x394;CSA in the non-weighted (r=0.027, &#x2206;R2 = 0.004, p = 0.731) or weighted (r=0.046, &#x2206;R2 = 0.003, p = 0.762) conditions. Participants responded to non-weighted walking by remaining constant, decreasing, or increasing in CSA and were placed into groups. We found a significant interaction effect for &#x394;CSA between groups and condition (F2,29 = 6.384, p = 0.005), suggesting that cartilage&#x2019;s response to load may be non-uniform.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation examines the participation of the USSR in the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) during the Cold War as a case study of the role of international organizations in Soviet engagement with the outside world. Utilizing archival material tapped in Russia and at UNESCO&#x2019;s headquarters in Paris, France, I provide the first analysis of how a noncommunist international organization integrated the USSR into the transnational flow of people, publications, and ideas in the postwar era before the onset of d&#xE9;tente in the late 1960s. I contextualize Soviet internationalism in the Western internationalist movements surrounding UNESCO, reinterpreting the post-Stalinist leadership&#x2019;s policy of &#x201C;peaceful coexistence&#x201D; as an acknowledgement that noncommunist international organizations were the legitimate venue for multilateral diplomacy. Approaching UNESCO from the perspective of Soviet citizens, I historicize the UN system by highlighting how these citizens, coming to the organization as outsiders, assessed the &#x201C;UN idea.&#x201D; Before the death of I. V. Stalin in 1953, the USSR boycotted UNESCO and other noncommunist international organizations outside the realm of security, using the internationalism of these organizations as a foil in the antiforeign and anti-cosmopolitan campaigns of late Stalinism. Because of the absence of the USSR from UNESCO, the West shaped the organization&#x2019;s culture, politics, and administrative practices in its first decade. After Stalin&#x2019;s death, the USSR under N. S. Khrushchev joined UNESCO in 1954. From 1954 to 1967, UNESCO extended to Soviet citizens new ways of   
      thinking internationally and appraising the USSR&#x2019;s place in the world, involving them in international public service, an international public sphere, and an international reading public. Members of the Soviet intelligentsia attended UNESCO events; Soviet professionals worked for years abroad in UNESCO&#x2019;s bureaucracy; and a range of citizens read UNESCO publications inside the USSR. Once it resolved to permanently stay in UNESCO after 1959, the USSR made progress toward rivaling the West in the organization. But as decolonization accelerated in the 1960s, the pluralizing world order attenuated the impact of this progress. Nevertheless, UNESCO&#x2019;s brand of internationalism offered Soviet citizens an alternative to Soviet internationalism once the latter grew hollow in the 1980s.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Effective decision making depends on an organism&#x2019;s ability to assess available resources and choose the best available option. Organisms must also assess changes to reward value and update their behavior accordingly to keep selecting the best option. Value-based decision making depends on neural pathways including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). A glutamatergic afferent to the NAc core, the prelimbic cortex (PrL), may also be implicated in value-based decision-making, such as delay discounting. However, it is unknown how these dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents to the NAc mediate value-based decision-making behavior. First, I used optogenetic techniques to examine the causal role of dopaminergic input to the NAc during delay discounting decision making tasks. This experiment revealed that dopamine release in the NAc core does not mediate delay discounting. The next set of experiments shifted focus to the PrL&#x2019;s glutamatergic ennervation of the NAc. Electrophysiological recording of the PrL during our delay discounting task revealed that PrL neurons track the predicted and eventual outcome of preferred rewards, as the value of that reward shifts across blocks. Further, this tracking differentially encoded preferred rewards depending on rats&#x2019; inherent impulsivity, such that high impulsive rats demonstrated preferential encoding of the small/immediate option. In the next experiment, optogenetic stimulation of the PrL-NAc core pathway revealed that glutamate signaling in the NAc core was not sufficient to mediate delay discounting. Together, these experiments help to characterize of the neural circuits and mechanisms by which delay discounting behavior is processed within the brain, providing insight into the potential role of the NAc and its dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents in mediating appropriate decisions.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Prediction and Evaluation of Hepatic Bile Acid Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions Using In Vitro Tools and Pharmacokinetic Modeling</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The objective of this doctoral dissertation research was to develop novel strategies to predict and evaluate drug interactions with hepatic bile acid transporters. Sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) and mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling were employed. Altered disposition of the model bile acid taurocholate (TCA) in human SCH due to inhibition of multiple transporters was predicted based on the potency of inhibitors [e.g., inhibition constant (Ki)] and kinetic parameters of TCA using pharmacokinetic modeling. The accuracy of predictions using total and unbound inhibitor concentrations was assessed. The effect of bosentan and telmisartan (model inhibitors) was predicted adequately by using intracellular unbound concentrations of the inhibitors. In subsequent studies, a simulation-based method was proposed to determine the relevant inhibitor concentration when predicting the effect of hepatic efflux transporter inhibition. For inhibitors with high plasma protein binding and/or high relative inhibition potency, using intracellular unbound rather than total inhibitor concentrations was optimal. The utility of this method was evaluated using experimental data from human SCH. To circumvent the limitations of individual transporter Ki data, a model-based approach was proposed to obtain overall Ki values against each efflux clearance pathway (i.e., biliary and basolateral efflux clearance) of TCA in rat SCH. The study design was optimized using modeling and simulation to estimate Ki values of troglitazone sulfate (the model inhibitor). Using this study design, Ki estimation in different hepatocyte lots, and limitations on the accuracy, were evaluated using simulated data. In addition to inhibition, transporter induction by Farnesoid X Receptor agonists was investigated in human SCH. Basolateral efflux and biliary clearance values for TCA, determined by pharmacokinetic modeling, were significantly increased by the Farnesoid X Receptor agonists, obeticholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. These studies provided direct functional evidence for transporter induction. Immunoblot analysis results suggested that organic solute transporter alpha/beta may be the primary transporter responsible for the increase in the basolateral efflux clearance of TCA.  
      This research leveraged pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to integrate and interpret in vitro bile acid transport data. The approaches developed and the results detailed in this dissertation will improve the accuracy of predictions and mechanistic understanding of drug-bile acid interactions.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Timothy Donald Conder: Becoming Good: The Spiritualities, Intimate Identities, and Collective Identity of Social Justice Activists in North Carolina&#x2019;s Moral Movement
      (Under the direction of George W. Noblit)
      The NAACP-convened "Forward Together" Moral Movement exploded into national consciousness in the Spring 2013 with a series of weekly "Moral Monday" protests at North Carolina's State Legislature. What began with the civil disobedience of seventeen faith leaders and activists has become a growing non-partisan, theo-political social movement. The Moral Movement demands the attention of social justice researchers for its deployment of a theo-moral logic of justice work and its construction of an intersectional, multi-faith, &#x201C;big tent&#x201D; constituency that intentionally performs a liberative and prophetic mode of Black Christianity.
      The diversity of the movement in logic and following provokes many questions regarding the role of spiritualities and religious ideology in public pedagogy and social justice activism. Notably, Protestant Christianity has historically positioned itself in opposition to critical, liberative social theories and the work of social justice (Kruse, 2015; Marsden, 1980; Milbank, 1990). The sharp contrast between the theo-moral politics of the Moral Movement and the social justice aversion of particularly White U.S. Protestantism demonstrates what ethnographer
      Siobh&#xE1;n Garrigan (2010) described in her study of peacemaking, "Christian worship [rituals] walk a line between peace-making and evil-tending every time they are performed" (p. 31). Noted critical theorists such as Cornel West (1999), Antonio Gramsci (1935/2000), and Louis Althusser (1971) have warned that theorists and activists ignore this double possibility in religion at the peril of seriously impairing the work of justice.
      iii
      This heart of this post-critical ethnography (Noblit et al., 2004) of the Moral Movement is the narrative life study (Maynes et al., 2008) of nine individuals in the movement. These nine represent significantly divergent positionalities, a variety of locations in Protestant Christian faith traditions, and a multiplicity of roles in the movement. Their life stories demonstrate meaningful pathways in contesting, negotiating, or deploying Christian faith heritages in the construction of activist identities. The study of the movement through a lens of ethnogenesis (Price, 2009)
      illustrates the potential stirrings of an evolving new people with a collective identity of justice activism.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Being a parent to a critically ill child requiring care in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) can be a stressful experience for parents.  Family-centered care (FCC) has been shown to improve outcomes for pediatric patients and families, however there has been little research examining FCC in the PICU from the parent perspective.  This dissertation consists of three distinct studies that examined the delivery of family-centered care and the parenting of a critically ill child in the PICU.  
      The first study synthesized the research literature regarding FCC in the PICU from the parent perspective based on the Institute for Patient and Family Centered Care (IPFCC) identified core concepts (e.g., respect and dignity, information sharing, participation, and collaboration).  This literature synthesis revealed that parents described both met and unmet needs regarding the implementation of FCC and led to development of a conceptual model of FCC in the PICU that included respect and dignity, information sharing, and participation as interacting with one another within the physical and cultural environment of the PICU.      
      Based on the findings of the first study, the second study aimed to further develop the PICU FCC conceptual model and examined parental perspectives of the impact of the physical and cultural environment of the PICU in the delivery of FCC.  The physical and cultural environment was found to exert both positive and negative contextual influence in the delivery of FCC per parent report.
       The third study examined and expanded on parental perception of the good parent construct as applied to parenting a child in the PICU over the first year of life.  Previously identified good parent themes including being an advocate, focusing on my child&#x2019;s quality of life, and being there for my child were present in parent interviews.  Newly identified themes included knowing my child, developing relationships with other PICU infants and families, and developing a trusting relationship with members of the health care team.  
      The findings of this dissertation add information to the PICU FCC body of literature by examining the delivery of FCC in the PICU from the parental perspective, acknowledging how the physical and cultural environments of the PICU impact parents of critically ill children, and informing how the good parent construct in the PICU evolves over time.  Future studies are needed to explore facilitators and barriers to implementation of FCC in the PICU as conceptualized by the IPFCC and other professional organizations</dc:description>

          <dc:title>THE CHALLENGE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT ACADEMIC MOTIVATION: THE GO FOR GROWTH! INTERVENTION</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The community college student population has been found to be less academically prepared than their four-year counterparts.  This relatively at-risk group is argued to struggle with academic motivation in the college setting.  Researchers studying student implicit theories of intelligence have found that students who struggle in academia may do so because of maladaptive beliefs about the nature of their own intelligence.  Students who struggle tend to believe their intelligence is stable (i.e. have a &#x201C;fixed&#x201D; mindset) whereas students who see their intelligence as malleable (i.e. have a &#x201C;growth&#x201D; mindset) have been found to have more adaptive behaviors that are more conducive to learning. Students&#x2019; goals in the academic context are important, as students with &#x201C;mastery&#x201D; orientations (who set goals for learning) had greater persistence and success than students with &#x201C;performance&#x201D; orientations (who set goals for showing learning or not showing a lack of learning). The present study was designed to assess whether an intervention targeting community college students&#x2019; implicit theories of intelligence was effective in a large southeastern community college at increasing students&#x2019; academic success, level of growth mindset, and level of mastery goal orientation.  Results following implementation of the Go for Growth! intervention suggested that instructors found the intervention easy and worthwhile to implement and found some indications that students receiving the intervention have greater academic success in the course containing intervention, although the theory suggesting that this occurs through improving levels of growth mindset and mastery orientation was not supported.  It was also noted that instructors had a significant influence on their student&#x2019;s grades, which might indicate that the intervention may also have impacted the perceptions of the instructors regarding student grades.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study examined media coverage of testing in schools in two newspapers - the New York Times and Education Week - over the 20-year period from 1996 to 2015.  Using a conceptual framework informed by framing theory and a quantitative text analysis technique called structural topic modeling on a dataset of over 8,000 articles, this study identified shifts in topic coverage and traced the evolution of the framing of the issue in the media across time.  Findings indicate a shift in framing from a more positive portrayal of testing in the years prior to passage of the federal No Child Left Behind Act to a more negative portrayal in the years after passage of the law.  The study contributes to the literature on media framing of education issues and the emerging literature on applications of topic modeling techniques to education policy.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In this thesis, I advocate for an ethnographic study of addiction experiences based on 8 weeks of preliminary fieldwork during the summer of 2017 among youth residing in Jammu City, Jammu and Kashmir, India. I expand the scholarship on the anthropology of addiction to South Asia by demonstrating how addiction experience is constituted in the everyday: through kinship relations, regional and national histories, and medical and juridical regimes of state-sponsored institutions. I do so by exploring the cultural and moral practice of &#x2018;dependency&#x2019; as a productive lens onto addiction experience, and which has long-served as an important idiom to theorize classic understandings of &#x2018;Indian personhood&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Indian Self&#x2019; in the South Asia literature. By locating addiction in the intimate relations of reliance and care that unfold between people, substances and institutions, my effort is to rethink &#x2018;dependency&#x2019; at the conjuncture of regional and national histories in Jammu, India.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation investigates late twentieth-century United States-based artists&#x2019; appropriations of civil rights movement imagery. I propose that these artists&#x2019; recasting of the movement&#x2019;s imagery posits it as a revealing point of entry for analyzing 1980s and 1990s identity politics and questions of appropriation in contemporary art and beyond. My inquiry focuses on Lorraine O&#x2019;Grady, Glenn Ligon, Alfredo Jaar, and Kerry James Marshall whose artwork challenged the ways that late twentieth-century dominant culture&#x2019;s portrayal of the movement obscured mid-twentieth-century civil rights activists&#x2019; efforts to overturn foundational American structures, which maintain racist oppression. By critically reconfiguring well-known representations of the movement, the artists of my study participated in concurrent art discourses about appropriation that treated it as a procedure for exposing how an intensifying media culture had unmoored representations from reality, depleting them of authoritative meaning. Yet, O&#x2019;Grady, Ligon, Jaar, and Marshall&#x2019;s appropriations evoke not the emptiness of the civil rights movement&#x2019;s conventional visual repertoire, but rather its resilient and outsized role in shaping Americans&#x2019; perceptions of social relations and (economic, gender, racial, and sexual) inequality. These four artists&#x2019; critiques of discriminatory structures of representation through the prism of the civil rights movement&#x2019;s legacy and the identity politics therein affords us insight for negotiating systemic racism and related axes of social subjugation today as well as art and visual culture&#x2019;s complicity in them.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The following thesis defines regional identity and describes the historical development of regional identity in Italy and the United Kingdom.  Case studies of those nations (Piedmont, Calabria, Scotland, and England) are used to illustrate different components of regional identity and compared.  This study is guided by how the concepts of regional identity challenge their nation&#x2019;s political-administrative and socio-economic centrality as relating to factors including history of both the nation and region, religious affiliation and importance, and politics.  This research synthesizes information to ultimately contribute to constructivist analyses of international politics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Systems Genetics Approach to Defining Genetic and MicroRNA Association with Diet-Associated Atherosclerosis</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a progressive condition that can develop over the course of decades, and eventually lead to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the world. Metabolic imbalance in the liver can cause dyslipidemia (abnormal levels of lipids) and aberrant levels of metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), both of which are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. Understanding the genetic influences and molecular networks that govern these processes is necessary to identify candidates for more effective therapeutics. 
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in various biological and pathological processes, and have been shown to be dysregulated in atherosclerosis. Most previous mouse studies of miRNAs in atherosclerosis have a common limitation in that they have utilized single inbred strains to study individual miRNAs of interest. These have left important knowledge gaps in the field that motivate new studies to understand the response of miRNAs to atherogenic diets in diverse genetic backgrounds.  Also, because miRNAs are purported to function cooperatively in groups, it is important to not simply focus investigative efforts on the actions of single miRNAs. My research directly addresses these gaps in the field. Specifically, I utilized an unbiased systems genetics approach in a genetically diverse mouse cohort from the Diversity Outbred (DO) resource to identify co-regulated modules of hepatic miRNAs, or rather groups of miRNAs in the liver that exhibit a shared response to a pro-atherogenic diet. I also quantified the extent of association between the miRNA groups, gene modules, and several cardiometabolic traits. Notably, we found that one particular group of miRNAs, comprising members such as miR-146, miR-27, miR-24, miR-199, and miR-181, is strongly correlated with circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
      The majority of previous studies on the cardiovascular disease risk factor and liver metabolite TMAO focus on its regulation by the gut microbiota as well as some host liver enzymes. However, there have been very few studies to investigate the effects of host genetics on circulating TMAO levels. To understand the genetic influences on TMAO, I performed quantitative trait loci mapping in the same DO cohort mentioned above. I identified a novel association between a locus on chromosome 12 and circulating TMAO levels. Also, I identified miR-146 as a strong candidate regulator of TMAO, which was corroborated in additional animal models (a mouse and non-human primate model) of cardiometabolic dysfunction.
      The findings from this body of work contribute to the field by addressing two major knowledge gaps, and warrant further study and validation in the context of atherosclerosis.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>A &#x2018;hydrogen economy&#x2019; using dihydrogen (H2) as a fuel has been proposed as a leading strategy for new environmentally friendly energy sources. Toward this end, the safe and efficient storage of H2 is an ongoing challenge in successful implementation on an industrial scale. As key catalysts in hydrogenation and hydrogen production reactions, transition metal hydride complexes must balance the strength of the metal hydride bond to maximize reactivity and retain stability. This work focuses on an in-depth investigation into the intricate thermodynamics that govern these systems and their potential use in guiding catalyst design and optimizing performance. 
      The hydricity of metal hydride complexes is a thermodynamic measure of the strength of the metal hydride bond. Hydricity has been measured extensively in acetonitrile and has been used as a valuable tool to guide catalyst design. The utility of these thermodynamic measurements has motivated expanded studies investigating the observed solvent dependence of hydricity. Presented here are three focused studies examining strategies for measurement, solvent dependence, and catalytic utility of hydricity. 1) A bimetallic Ir/Ru catalyst is used as a case study of solvent dependent thermodynamics. The electrochemistry, acidity, hydricity, and electronic structure of  
      the complex is explored in two solvents and applied to a detailed picture describing catalysis observed by the system. 2) Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to overcome traditional challenges in aqueous hydricity measurement. Through the development of appropriate training sets to calibrate computational results, the reduction potentials and acidities of a series of iridium complexes are determined in water and used to calculate aqueous hydricities for comparison with experimental values. 3) The first example of a systematic study of the solvent dependence of hydricity across a series of electronically tuned iridium catalysts is presented in acetonitrile and water: this work explores the connection between the influence of electronic tuning and effective hydricity.
      This work unveils the thermodynamics driving kinetic observations for transition metal hydride complexes. Through a thorough understanding of the optimal strategies for catalyst tuning in multiple solvents, new generation of systems powering the &#x2018;hydrogen economy&#x2019; can be developed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Affective disorders and substance abuse disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent within the US and result in substantial burdens on the affected individual, their loved ones, and society. Relatively few effective treatments exist however, due to a lack of understanding regarding the etiology of these complex disorders. Development of affective and SUDs are due to both environmental factors, (i.e. perinatal insults, childhood maltreatment, stressful life events), genetic background and the complex interplay of the two. Using inbred strains of mice can potentially disentangle the two (environment and genetic factors), and elucidate their interactions to aid in the identification of specific mechanisms. However, traditional inbred strains pose some limitations in the variation of genetic diversity present, which limits our ability to capture a full phenotypic range that may better model disease states seen in humans. In this thesis, we use a relatively new population of recombinant inbred strains, the Collaborative Cross (CC), that were designed to have increased genetic, and therefore phenotypic, diversity over traditional inbred strains. 
      We used a panel of female F1 hybrids of CC strains (RIX) to investigate the effects of an environmental factor, nutritional deficiency in the perinatal period, genetic background, parent-of-origin (PO) and any interactions on stress response, anxiety-, and depressive-like behaviors inadulthood. From this phenotypic screen, we identified two RIX lines (RIX 41/51 and 04/17) that were outliers for novelty-induced locomotion, a predictive trait for addiction-related behaviors. We characterized RIX 41/51 and 04/17 for cocaine (COC)-related behaviors and possible underlying mechanisms including COC metabolism, HPA axis dysregulation and dopamine dynamics in the striatum. We also performed QTL mapping for low initial locomotor response to COC using an F2 intercross of CC041/TauUnc and C57BL/6NJ and identified three significant QTLs on Chr 7, 11 and 14. These studies are the first to assess the CC or RIX of CC for addiction-related behaviors and provides evidence that RIX 41/51 and 04/17 are novel models with a unique genetic diversity to study the underlying mechanisms involved in COC-related behaviors.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The United States boasts the world&#x2019;s highest rates of incarceration and community supervision for individuals involved in the criminal justice system. Approximately 40% of these individuals are early adults aged 18 to 29. However, little information is available on the criminogenic risks and needs for this age group, even though this age group is less cognitively developed than adults over age 30 which leads to higher impulsivity, lower reasoning, and inhibited executive functioning. Moreover, individuals involved in the criminal justice system experience trauma at rates substantially higher than the general population. Traumatic experiences are associated with impulsivity, substance use, lower reasoning, and violent reactions. This three-paper dissertation provides foundational information about the criminogenic risk and needs, as well as the traumatic experiences, for early adults. Paper one is a systematic review of trauma-informed interventions used with justice-involved populations. Paper two uses administrative data to explore criminogenic needs among early adult probationers, as well as nuances of criminogenic need based on gender and mental health symptomology. Paper three uses primary data collected from probationers with serious mental illnesses to assess the extent to which trauma is present among this high-risk, high-need population. Results show that little research is focusing on how early adults have unique needs separate from older adults. Additionally, few trauma-informed programs are being successfully implemented with justice-involved populations. Findings also suggest a need for trauma-informed programs to be provided  
      within the criminal justice system, as well as programming focused on criminogenic needs responsive to the unique needs of females and individuals with mental health symptoms. Implications are discussed related to future programming for criminal justice populations served by social workers, early adults&#x2019; needs, and the presence of trauma and criminogenic needs among justice-involved populations with mental health needs.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Nanocomposites, particularly carbon nanocomposites, find many applications spanning an impressive variety of industries on account of their impressive properties and versatility. However, the discrepancy between the performance of individual nanoparticles and that of nanocomposites suggests continued technological development and better theoretical understanding will provide much opportunity for further property enhancement. Study of computational renderings of disordered fiber systems has been successful in various nanocomposite modeling applications, particularly toward the characterization of electrical properties. Motivated by these successes, I develop an explanatory model for `mechanical' or `rheological percolation,' terms used by experimentalists to describe a nonlinear increase in elastic modulus/strength that occurs at particle inclusion volume fractions well above the electrical percolation threshold. Specifically, I formalize a hypothesis given by \citet*{penu}, which states that these dramatic gains result from the formation of a `rigid CNT network.' Idealizing particle interactions as hinges, this amounts to the network property of \emph{rigidity percolation}---the emergence of a giant component (within the inclusion contact network) that is not only connected, but furthermore the inherent contacts are patterned to constrain all internal degrees of freedom in the component. Rigidity percolation has been studied in various systems (particularly the characterization of glasses and proteins) but has never been applied to disordered systems of three-dimensional rod-like particles. With mathematically principled arguments from \emph{rigidity matroid theory}, I develop a scalable algorithm (\emph{Rigid Graph Compression}, or \emph{RGC}), which can be used to detect rigidity percolation in such systems by iteratively compressing provably rigid subgraphs within the rod contact networks. Prior to approaching the 3D system, I confirm the usefulness of \emph{RGC} by using it to accurately approximate the rigidity percolation threshold in disordered systems of 2D fibers---achieving $&lt;1\%$ error relative to a previous exact method. Then, I develop an implementation of \emph{RGC} in three dimensions and determine an upper bound for the rigidity percolation threshold in disordered 3D fiber systems. More work is required to show that this approximation is sufficiently accurate---however, this work confirms that rigidity in the inclusion network is a viable explanation for the industrially useful mechanical percolation. Furthermore, I use \emph{RGC} to quantitatively characterize the effects of interphase growth and spatial CNT clustering in a real polymer nanocomposite system of experimental interest.</dc:description>

      The transatlantic divide between the United States and the European Union on genetically modified organisms is reflected in the distinct regulatory approaches, levels in crop cultivation, and consumer acceptance. The purpose of this paper is to outline the key characteristics of the different attitudes and regulatory approaches on genetically engineered crops and food as well as connect the dots of the preferences of the actors involved and how they have influenced consumers&#x2019; preferences, the policymaking process, and regulatory outcomes. Public opinion, institutional structures, and cultural approaches to agriculture, and land usage are among the key features that help to explain the contrasting approaches and regulatory outcomes seen in the United States and the European Union.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Being a principal in today's high-stakes environment is a highly demanding job. Much has been written about the stress principals now face in responding to the increased demands and pressures associated with the role. Districts nationwide continue go to great lengths to find administrators of the highest caliber capable of meeting these increasing demands. As a growing number of women assume the principalship at a younger age, a unique set of challenges has emerged. Finding partners and starting a family is difficult, as female principals typically work long hours and expend tremendous energy to succeed. For principals who are married with children, the challenges are also great. Competing demands and divided priorities often create consequences that are rarely discussed. Support from colleagues, supervisors, and family proved to be essential in for study participants in combating these consequences. Setting personal boundaries and realizing that work should not be the only aspect of one's life also proved essential for women who were able to "have it all." Policymakers should address women's career challenges, since feminist leadership skills have been proven to create the conditions for successful schools, and the number of women in the principalship is growing nationwide.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Although the expansion of school choice options in the U.S. has been widely discussed, few studies have examined their impact on racial segregation in traditional public schools. I study this relationship by examining changes in levels of White-Black, White-Hispanic, and White-Asian segregation of school-age children in schools and their catchment areas between 2000 and 2010 in the 22 largest school districts in the U.S. Findings show that schools have higher levels of segregation than their corresponding catchment areas and that school segregation increased in a majority of these districts during this time period, independent of changes in residential segregation. In a second study of over 20,000 schools in the 2009-2010 school year, I examine the factors that predict the enrollment of Whites in their neighborhood schools. I find that, net of a school&#x2019;s quality, the racial composition of the catchment area continues to have a significant effect on White enrollment.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) adversely affects air quality and human health. Isoprene is the most abundant non-methane volatile organic compound primarily emitted from biogenic sources to Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. Atmospheric oxidation of isoprene yields large quantities of gaseous isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) by hydroxyl radicals under low-nitric oxide conditions. IEPOX subsequently undergoes acid-catalyzed multiphase chemistry with natural or anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, producing substantial amounts of water-soluble IEPOX-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in PM2.5. The hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography interfaced to electrospray ionization-high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HILIC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS) method presented here overcomes limitations of commonly utilized analytical techniques, making it possible to identify and quantify water-soluble SOA constituents by a single analytical method. Atmospheric chemistry model predictions of the water-soluble IEPOX-derived SOA constituents (e.g., 2-methyltetrols and methyltetrol sulfates) in PM2.5 can now be assessed with greater accuracy and confidence.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Postcentral Topectomy Optimization by Selective Ablations of the Primary Somatosensory Cortex</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Postcentral topectomy is a neurosurgical procedure, practiced in the mid-20th century, in which surgical ablations of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) were used as a therapeutic means of treating patients suffering from intractable chronic pain. While successful in treating many cases, the procedure was poorly understood and eventually became displaced by methods that more consistently stopped patient complaints of pain, such as opiates and frontal lobotomies.  
      SI contains nociresponsive neurons in two regions: one region in cytoarchitectonic area 1, with properties resembling sharp, discriminative, first pain; and the other in the anterior part of area 3a, with properties resembling burning, affective, second pain. To test the hypothesis that permanent pain loss in postcentral topectomy was achieved when the nociresponsive part of area 3a was removed, we trained unrestrained squirrel monkeys to obtain a juice reward by pulling a noxiously heated metal rod. Pull duration shows high sensitivity to rod temperature and was used as a measure of each animal&#x2019;s pain sensibility. After training, all monkeys gave consistent baseline pull durations for each trial in a series of chosen neutral (control) and noxious temperatures.
      Next, we made small electrolytic cortical lesions in 2 monkeys, targeting the hand region of nociresponsive area 3a. These lesions significantly elevated pull durations for at least 4 months (at which time the animals were euthanized), thus indicating permanently reduced pain sensibility. In contrast, ablation of motor cortex anterior to area 3a in the 3rd monkey significantly reduced pull durations, indicating permanently elevated pain sensibility. 
      The current opioid crisis makes these results particularly relevant to clinical medicine. Although the precise location of area 3a in the central sulcus varies extensively among humans, its nociresponsive region can be accurately localized in any given patient by using high-resolution fMRI. Once localized, the area 3a nociresponsive region can be targeted for reversible or permanent inactivation. Such precisely targeted inactivation might greatly improve the success rate of the postcentral topectomy in amelioration of pathological pain, making it a highly attractive means of treating otherwise intractable chronic pain.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>CD73 is a ubiquitously expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that converts extracellular adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. CD73 couples closely with ecto-apyrase (CD39), which supplies the AMP substrate via sequential dephosphorylation of extracellular ATP. CD73-generated adenosine functions in an autocrine and paracrine manner to control numerous physiological responses by activating one of four subtypes of G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors: A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R.  Missense mutations in the CD73-encoding gene NT5E cause the rare, adult-onset vascular disease named &#x2018;arterial calcifications due to deficiency of CD73&#x2019; (ACDC). Aside from direct human disease involvement, cellular and animal model studies have revealed key functions of CD73 in tissue homeostasis and pathophysiologic responses in the cardiovascular and central nervous system, as well as epithelial tissues, including the lung, kidney and liver. This review covers CD73 functions in multiple organ systems, with a focus on novel findings from the last 3-5 years.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation treats different, but related subjects, in three distinct papers. Findings result from interviews, focus groups, participatory community mapping and GPS data collected intermittently over a period of 20 months in the Sondr&#xE9;-Est Pastoral Zone area in the Center-South Region of Burkina Faso.
      The first paper examines the nature of farmer-herder conflicts and where they occur. Following the major droughts of the 1970s in Burkina Faso, the government resettled herders and farmers from northern drylands in more fertile areas in the southern river valleys of the country. Local chiefs &#x2013; ruling over agricultural communities &#x2013; conceded land to migrants. This study integrates spatial analysis with narratives to contextualize contemporary land use tensions between resettled herders and resettled and autochthonous farmers. It found that conflicts occur in very particular places along the border where key resources such as water are located. This offers an important methodological contribution to political ecology. 
      While most studies on herder-farmer relations have focused on conflicts, the second paper explores the nature of farmer-herder cooperation as both groups converge toward agro-pastoralism. Sondr&#xE9;-Est is ideal for this study as it has ethnically distinct herders and farmers who inhabit the same area. They are adapting to similar climatic stresses in very different ways. People from both groups exchange resources and technical knowledge. This study allows for comparisons within and between farmer and herder groups, which is rare in climate adaptation research. 
      The third paper delves deeper into within-group comparisons. This paper looks more precisely at gender differences in land use management. It shows the contrast between women&#x2019;s increased leadership in household decision-making as an adaptation to social and ecological changes and their persistent under-representation in community management committees. This paper highlights that the existence of quotas and parity policies coming from international donors does not guarantee the equal access of men and women to decision-making processes regarding land resources management. It argues that the exclusion of women from community land management results from the divide between local values and top-down state policies aiming for gender parity. This study questions the State&#x2019;s ability to regulate its constituents at the local level.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>When firms internationalize, they select from a menu of entry modes. Firms' choice of entry mode is partially dependent on host country external uncertainty, one component of which is policy risk. Extant political science work on the determinants of cross-border investment has tended to ignore variation in entry modes, focusing instead on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. Redirecting the conversation from aggregated FDI flows to firm-level internationalization decisions, I argue that preferential trade agreements (PTAs), as a signal of commitment to certain policies, lower policy risk and facilitate high-risk entry modes. Further, I theorize that PTA chapters targeted at certain sectors should primarily impact firms in those sectors. Using firm-level transactions data from up to 146 non-OECD countries from 1990-2017 and multilevel logistic regression, I find that PTAs are strongly associated with riskier entry modes and that there is a moderate sector-specific effect for services chapters.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory posits that elements of early life affect susceptibility to chronic disease during adulthood. Postnatal growth is one such element of early life that has been hypothesized as influencing chronic disease such as Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD), which is responsible for one out of every three deaths in the United States. Researchers in the field of developmental origins hypothesize that postnatal growth is an environmental factor that permanently programs lipid metabolism, a known and well-established risk factor for ASCVD. We investigated the association between early postnatal anthropometric change and adverse lipid levels in adolescence in a contemporary Chilean birth cohort. Primary aims included:  a) characterize predictors of infant growth, b) investigate the association between early infant growth trajectories and lipid levels, and c) evaluate the capacity of postnatal growth trajectories to modify the association between functional genetic variants and lipid levels in adolescence. 
      Results from this research demonstrated distinct patterns of growth in which faster anthropometric growth groups were associated with a more favorable lipid profile. In the first manuscript, lower socioeconomic position was associated with a lower length velocity SITAR parameter (-0.22, 95\% CI=-0.31,-0.13). In the second manuscript, the length velocity SITAR parameter was positively associated with HDL-C levels in adolescence (11.5, SE=4.0) indicating higher HDL-C levels with faster length growth. Second, latent growth mixture models supported the strongest associations between higher LDL-C and slower WFL growth although no associations were statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Lastly, the third manuscript provided little evidence supporting a concept that growth is an effect modifier when assessing genetic associations with lipids.
      Taken together, these results identify faster growth in early infancy as a protective factor.  Mechanisms by which this occurs remain an open question, and postnatal growth remains a possible environmental cue for lipid metabolism programming. In turn, this information can support the search for optimal postnatal growth and with it, the potential for modification of chronic disease risk factor development later in life.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The purpose of these studies was to provide a depiction of academic performance for students who are deaf and hard of hearing and the related services they receive. The first study utilized statewide, longitudinal data to examine standardized public school testing results in reading. Furthermore, it estimated how hearing loss, the use of testing accommodations, and school membership impacts performance. Comparted to students who were typically developing, students who are deaf or hard of hearing demonstrated statistically significant poorer performance on end of grade reading tests administered annually between grades 3 and 8. Students who were deaf or hard of hearing who utilized testing accommodations performed significantly worse than students who did not use accommodations.  The achievement gap between students who are deaf or hard of hearing and typically developing students was observed at grade 3 and persisted until 8th grade, the final grade of administration. 
      The second study focused on the preschool and school services received by students who are hard of hearing. In addition to a thorough account of the service characteristics and the professionals who provide them, this study analyzed differences in service setting, amount of family participation, and service provider confidence providing support to this unique population.  A majority (81%) of preschool age CHH received services. Children were more likely to be in a preschool for children who are deaf or hard of hearing (CDHH) or exceptional children than a general education preschool.  By elementary school, 70% received services, nearly all in general education settings. Sessions averaged twice a week for a total of approximately 90 minutes. Children who no longer received services performed significantly better on speech/language measures than those who received services, regardless of service setting. Professionals were primarily speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and teachers of CDHH.  Speech-language pathologists reported significantly less comfort with skills involving auditory development and hearing technologies
      Through an examination of historical and current literature, the final component of this dissertation employed an historical account with current evidence to guide clinicians in the evaluation of children who are hard of hearing during the preschool and early elementary school years.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation is concerned with understanding how the behavior of a concentration of tracer undergoing an advection-diffusion process in Poiseuille flows depends on the pipe cross-section.
      Solutions to the advection-diffusion problem are approached both for the longitudinal moments of the concentration, via exact and asymptotics analysis, and for the entire tracer concentration, via analysis and experiments. The main focus of this work is on the skewness of the distribution, which is the simplest statistic to describe longitudinal asymmetries in the tracer concentration. The results of exact and asymptotic analysis along with experiments and numerical simulations, show that the distribution&#x2019;s skewness depends significantly on the cross section of the pipe.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Industrial poultry production in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in North Carolina has grown rapidly, with North Carolina now ranked nationally as a top poultry producer. The Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin harbors the highest density of poultry production among North Carolina river basins. This study examined the effect of poultry CAFOs on water quality in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin by comparing watersheds with CAFOs (n=5) to those without CAFOs (n=4). In partnership with Yadkin Riverkeeper, we collected surface water samples during both dry weather and wet weather events, for a total of 36 samples analyzed. Each sample was evaluated for Escherichia coli concentrations and antibiotic resistance profiles. Few E. coli isolates were antibiotic resistant. A multiple linear regression indicated presence of poultry CAFOs resulted in higher E. coli concentrations compared to background sites and that every 1-mm increase in precipitation resulted in higher E. coli concentrations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Influence of Non-Covalent Interactions on Photoinduced Electron Transfer at Interfaces and in Fluid Solution</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Photoinduced electron transfer is an essential reaction in biology and artificial solar energy conversion. In the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), regeneration of a semiconductor-anchored sensitizer through electron transfer from a solution-based redox mediator is a crucial reaction that is not optimized under operational conditions. Non-covalent interactions offer a way to control and enhance regeneration. This work details efforts in the development of finite control over electron transfer reactions, both at solid-liquid interfaces and in solution. The DSSC is introduced in the context of non-covalent interactions and pertinent electron transfer theory and techniques in Chapter 1.
      Chapters 2 and 3 focus on non-covalent enhancement of the regeneration reaction. Chapter 2 describes how a sensitizer&#x2019;s increased  propensity to form halogen bonds with the iodide redox mediator leads to an increase in the regeneration rate constant. The increased rate constant correlated with larger DSSC photovoltages. Chapter 3 demonstrates the importance of frontier molecular orbital overlap for electron transfer. Variation of a single chalcogen atom on a sensitizer showed an order of magnitude increase in regeneration only when the frontier molecular orbital localized on the chalcogen  atom.
       
      Chapters 4-8 investigate electron transfer within electrostatic ion pairs. In chapter 4, bromide formed two-consecutive ion pairs with a dicationic ruthenium sensitizer, that yielded a drastic shut-off and then recovery of photoluminescence, which aligns with the Gibbs free energy for electron transfer. Chapters 5-8 utilize a dicationic bipyridyl ligand to increase the cationic charge of ruthenium polypyridyl compounds. In chapter 5, three ruthenium compounds, with 4+, 6+, or 8+ charge, show enhanced ion pairing with iodide in acetonitrile. Chapter 6 characterizes a rare example of ion pairing at the sensitized interface. Regeneration occurred rapidly, k &gt; 108 s-1, within an ion pair between a hexacationic ruthenium and an anionic cobalt redox mediator. Chapter 7 determines the excited-state quenching mechanism of similar ruthenium-cobalt ion pairs through ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Finally, chapter 8 extends the use of ion pairs to excited-state proton-coupled electron transfer (ES-PCET). Direct measurement of the ES-PCET rate constants within the ion pair facilitated the determination of a sequential proton, electron transfer (PT-ET) mechanism.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Explaining the origins of diversity is an enduring goal in evolutionary ecology, and in few places is this diversity as striking as in sexual signals. One significant pressure driving signal design is the presence of competitors.  These competitors may be either of the same species and competing for resources such as mates, or of different species and competing for other resources such as signal space.  In my first chapter, I explore how changes in signal design, driven by reproductive character displacement, can be facilitated by changes in habitat.  In my second, I explore the role of signal design in determining facultative signal adjustment in response to interference from competitors.  I find that differences in ecoregion can cause variation in reproductive character displacement throughout a range of sympatry, and that signal structure plays an important role in determining how animals facultatively respond to signal interference.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Parents continue to decline or delay immunizing their children resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease across the United States. Efforts to profile these parents struggle to find demographic consensus or create a consistent profile of which parents make these problematic decisions. These parents are often assumed to be under the sway of misinformation, exacerbating the division between them and healthcare providers. Research about this population typically studies the behavior in isolate and in relation to the mainstream view where it is normative to vaccinate one&#x2019;s children. 
      This dissertation, a grounded theory embedded chronological case study of a vaccine-avoidant mommy blogger, describes a worldview where vaccination avoidance and delay is normative and documents related behaviors and beliefs that accompany not vaccinating one&#x2019;s children. This was accomplished using multiple methods, particularly inductive coding, memoing, quantitative and qualitative content analysis, bibliometrics, and digital ethnography. Data streams included seven years of blog posts, videos, comment threads, information citations, artifacts endorsed or created by the blogger, and an assessment of family resemblances between the blogger and her digital peer network. 
      From the data emerged a theoretical model that overlapped with Ludwik Fleck&#x2019;s theory of thought collectives and Elfreda Chatman&#x2019;s theory of information poverty. The findings include a set of family resemblances observed in the data and artifacts and assessed against a network of nearly 90 other cases. The findings include bibliometric evaluation of the information the blogger cited and discussion of her information behavior and how information operates within her worldview, where vaccine avoidance and delay is normative.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Problem of Sovereignty: Nations, Corporations and Power Relations</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The contemporary moment is characterized by a multitude of crises, which I argue are the result of a crisis within the historical transformation of sovereignty. While sovereignty is expressed through different forms in different socio-historical contexts, it is fundamentally a question of the organization, relations, mechanisms, and operations of power. Within the context of the United States in the 21st century, the question of sovereignty is best addressed by reframing two narratives that are commonly offered to explain this context and its multiple crises. The first&#x2014;neoliberalism&#x2014;understands the current era as being characterized by the reorganization of economic, political and social life to operate according to market forces. The second&#x2014;fascism&#x2014;is theorized primarily as an ideology or particular type of political regime, and is often used in popular discourse as a slur against one&#x2019;s political adversaries, regardless of their actual politics. 
      I reframe these narratives in order to provide a better understanding of the current moment. Regarding neoliberalism, I turn our attention away from &#x201C;the market&#x201D; to the dominance of the business corporation in the organization of social and power relations. The current moment is better understood as the era of corporism&#x2014;a condition whereby economic, political and social relations are organized according to the sovereignty of the business corporation in relation to the nation-state. This is supported by an examination of three institutions/phenomena (i.e. ALEC, DARPA and the Singularity) that indicate the assertion of corporate sovereignty in 21st century America.
      I then turn to the question of fascism, considering a set of theories that do not usually inform political scholarship in order to demonstrate the necessity of understanding the crises we face as a form of fascism, without lapsing into unfounded name-calling. This is supported by a re-examination of ALEC, DARPA and the Singularity, and an examination of the private military and security industry (PMSI), which indicate the fascist character of these forces of corporate sovereignty. Ultimately, I demonstrate that the transformation of power relations between the U.S. nation-state and legal form of the business corporation is fundamentally characterized by a crisis in the transformation of sovereign power.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY AMONG URANIUM MINERS IN THE P&#x158;&#xCD;BRAM REGION OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC</dc:title>

          <dc:description>There is strong evidence that radon is carcinogenic to humans, and the positive relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality has been demonstrated among several cohorts of uranium miners. However, information is lacking on radon-cancer dose-response relationship at low level exposures, differences between cancer incidence and mortality, the joint effects of smoking and radon, and risks associated with radon exposure and cancers other than lung.
      To better understand cancer incidence and mortality among miners occupationally-exposed to low levels of radon progeny, we analyzed data for uranium miners in the P&#x159;&#xED;bram region of the Czech Republic. A total of 16,434 male employees who worked at least 12 months underground between 1949 and 1991, and were alive and residing in Czechoslovakia at the start of the Czech cancer registry (1/1/1977), were included in the cohort. The case-cohort data included more precise radon exposure estimates and smoking information. Standardized mortality and incidence ratios were calculated. Expected disease rates were based on age- and calendar period-specific national mortality and cancer incidence rates. For internal analyses, the association between cumulative radon exposure and cancers was modeled using log-linear rate and linear excess relative rate models 
      We observed a 52% increase in deaths from all malignant causes compared to expected rates. Miners had higher rates of death than expected due to lung and extrathoracic cancer. Higher than expected incidence was observed for lung, stomach, rectal, liver, extrathoracic, and some hematopoietic cancers. Positive associations were observed between radon and lung cancer incidence along with modification by smoking. The ERR/100WLM was 0.12 (95%CI: -0.09, 0.33) among non-smokers and 1.34 (95%CI: 0.88, 1.80) among smokers. Associations between cumulative radon exposure and extrathoracic cancer incidence (ERR/100 WLM = 0.07; 95%CI: -0.17, 0.31) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ERR/100 WLM = 0.24; 95%CI: -0.80, 1.27) were positive but imprecise.
      Consistent with other published studies of uranium miners, we observed positive associations between radon exposure, and lung cancer and the joint effect of smoking and radon exposure is greater than additive. Further investigation of associations between radon and extrathoracic cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are needed to estimate more precise exposure-response associations.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Emergency Department Visits in a Pediatric Population: An Examination of Sports and Recreation-Related Injuries and Traumatic Brain Injuries among School-Age Children in North Carolina</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Sports and recreational activities provide numerous physical and mental health benefits. However, these activities also involve an inherent risk of injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although the relationship between sports and recreational activities and injury is well documented, there is still much to be described about the characteristics of these injuries, particularly in children. This dissertation included two studies using emergency department (ED) data to describe the burden of sports and recreation-related (SR) injuries among youth. The first study used 2010-2014 North Carolina ED visit data to describe the incidence of SR injuries among school-age youth, 5-18 years of age. The second study utilized data collected as part of a prospective study of youth, 5-17 years of age, with suspected TBIs presenting to a large, metropolitan hospital system during 2013-2014.
      In our first study, we identified 767,075 unintentional injury-related ED visits among school-age youth from 2010-2014, of which 213,518 (28%) were SR-related. The incidence rate of SR ED visits among school-age youth was 23.7 ED visits per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 23.6-23.8). In comparison to other injuries among school-age youth, SR ED visits were more likely to have a diagnosis of an injury to the upper extremity, the lower extremity, and a TBI or other head, neck, or facial injury. The leading category of SR-related injury was sports/athletics played as a group or team (e.g. American tackle football).
      In our second study, we identified 1,526 ED visits among school-age children with suspected TBIs enrolled in the parent study, of which 352 visits were due to SR activities. Children with suspected TBIs due to SR activities were more likely to have a history of TBI, report signs and symptoms of TBI, and require imaging services, as compared to children with injuries related to other causes.
      Sports and recreation-related injury places a heavy burden on the youth population. While programs and policies exist to minimize the risk of injury due to sports and recreational activities, our finding emphasize that such prevention activities need to consider sex, age, and type of sport/recreational activity, among other factors, when assessing injury risk.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>"Menagerie to me / My Neighbor be": Exotic Animals and American Conscience, 1840-1900</dc:title>
          <dc:date>2018-01-01T05:00:00Z</dc:date>
          <dc:type>Text</dc:type>
          <dc:format>Text</dc:format>
          <dc:description>Throughout the nineteenth century, large numbers of living &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; animals&#x2014;elephants, lions, and tigers&#x2014;circulated throughout the U.S. in traveling menageries, circuses, and later zoos as staples of popular entertainment and natural history education. In &#x201C;Menagerie to me / My Neighbor be,&#x201D; I study literary representations of these displaced and sensationalized animals, offering a new contribution to Americanist animal studies in literary scholarship, which has largely attended to the cultural impact of domesticated and native creatures. The field has not yet adequately addressed the influence that representations of foreign animals had on socio-cultural discourses, such as domesticity, social reform, and white supremacy.
      I examine how writers enlist exoticized animals to variously advance and disrupt the human-centered foundations of hierarchical thinking that underpinned nineteenth-century tenets of civilization, particularly the belief that Western culture acts as a progressive force in a comparatively barbaric world. Both well studied and lesser-known authors, however, find &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; animal figures to be wily for two seemingly contradictory reasons. For one, these figures often exceed the bounds and norms of &#x201C;civilized&#x201D; American society, from connoting the strangeness of distant lands to escaping their enclosures. While such representations affirm the animals&#x2019; exoticized status, authors show the difficulty of accounting for the animals&#x2019; mental, emotional, and social capacities. Secondly, and arguably because alien animals present impenetrable mysteries, the authors of this study confront the possibility of finding correspondence and compatibility with &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; animality, even testing the potential for a civil society more open to and tolerant of non-Anglo American difference. This process reveals a public struggling to understand their ethical and cultural identities and responsibilities in the face of global and animal alterity.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Business ecosystems are gaining in attention in contemporary scholarship. Historically, research has focused on how firms compete against other firms, how industries compete against other industries, or how markets compete against other markets (Moore, 1993; Mason &amp; Brown, 2014). Attention is now turning to how business ecosystems compete against other business ecosystems. This dissertation introduces the concept of community economic ecosystem to the body of business and entrepreneurship ecosystem literature as a central component of understanding economic development, and applies it to study race as a contextual variable within entrepreneurial ecosystems and their outcomes. 
      The first paper asks whether minority entrepreneurs have achieved parity with their shares of the national population in terms of business formation, growth and expansion. The findings suggest that America&#x2019;s various business ecosystems seem to have moved from de jure segregation to de facto segregation, as opposed to fuller integration. While the overall diversity of the business ecosystem is changing rapidly, the business success ecosystem might not be diversifying as fast, if at all. 
      The second paper asks what impact would the location of black entrepreneurs in minority entrepreneurial hubs, such as Atlanta, Georgia and Durham, North Carolina have on the relative economic equity of those populations compared to other racial groups in the area. The findings suggest that even in communities with relatively sizable black populations, high levels of black formal human capital, black experiential human capital, black wealth, black entrepreneurial spirit, and black political leadership, the economic outcomes for the black community still lag behind other communities. 
      The final paper asks whether entrepreneurship provides a viable means for advancing mutually beneficial economic outcomes for black Americans &#x2013; individually and collectively; and whether it ever has. A reinterpretation of Durham&#x2019;s historic Hayti community, from the end of the Civil War to the end of the Civil Rights Era, illustrates that this racial enclave was able to utilize strategic upbuilding to construct a &#x201C;group economy&#x201D; effective at combating overt discrimination, relying on the institutional anchoring of their community via financial, educational, cultural, and political institutions, among others.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Genetic mapping is a process by which researchers seek to identify genetic factors that influence a trait of interest. Such efforts typically focus on those that either increase or decrease the trait of interest, and assume that the variance of the trait is constant across all individuals. I develop and apply statistical methods that challenge that assumption in two ways. First, I consider the situation where non-genetic factors influence trait variance, which I term &#x201C;background variance heterogeneity&#x201D;. Though they are not of immediate interest in a genetic mapping study, they can be exploited to align observations&#x2019; weights with their precisions. Second, I consider the situation where genetic factors influence trait variance, which I term &#x201C;foreground variance heterogeneity&#x201D;. Such factors are of immediate interest because they represent novel discoveries that could be missed by standard analyses.
      I consider both foreground and background variance heterogeneity as they relate to linkage disequilibrium mapping in exchangeable mapping populations. I report three novel genetic factors with strong evidence that they influence medically-important traits in the mouse model system. Finally, I consider the background variance heterogeneity as it relates to association mapping in non-exchangeable populations. I report a mathematical advance that makes possible the fitting of a statistical model that accommodates background variance heterogeneity in non-exchangeable populations.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The present study was conducted to investigate changes in dialectal tolerance and/or social emotional competencies of Linguistics 101 students through the duration of a semester. Students from Linguistics 101 were surveyed twice during Spring 2018, along with students from a control class outside of Linguistics. A third class based in variationist theory was also surveyed. Six speaker clips of various dialects (Valley Girl, AAE, NNS, and SAE) were played for participants in a verbal-guise task, to be rated on politeness, level of education, sociability, kindness, and professionalism. Participants were asked to rate themselves according to the five core competencies of social emotional learning: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills, and Responsible Decision Making. Minor differences appeared in relation to social emotional competencies when comparing linguistics students to a control group. Dialect tolerance ratings showed minor differences, but not enough to suggest that an introductory linguistics course can change inherent biases.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In this dissertation, I describe a series of permanent sample plots in the North Carolina Piedmont used to examine near-century forest processes and to evaluate how observed trends can inform existing conceptual models. Specifically, 80 years of tree growth and forest composition were recorded across all succession phases in a series of successional Pinus taeda stands and second-growth Quercus-Carya and Liriodendron-Liquidambar hardwood stands in the Duke Forest. I use these long-term data to scrutinize classical theories of community dynamics and growth trends in Piedmont forests that have served as a model system for successional research for nearly 100 years. Specifically, using a suite of multivariate statistics I examine whether old-field pine forests have succeeded toward putative climax compositions or whether deviations in successional trajectories have occurred owing to shifts in species composition and disturbance events. I additionally examine whether biomass of successional stands can be predicted based on canopy mortality and lags in regeneration and whether growth rates of later-stage forests have increased more than expected over the last century. 80-year biomass and growth trends in successional plots confirm the importance of canopy density and mortality in driving these patterns, but lag patterns in post-hurricane regeneration are not yet formally discernible. In contrast, second-growth hardwood plots demonstrate consistent biomass accumulation and continued increases in growth rate, despite having achieved biomass levels found in more static old-growth forests. Community analyses indicate that successional stands experienced shifting compositional trajectories that were accelerated by Hurricane Fran and resulted in replacement of upland-associated hardwood species (e.g., Cornus florida) with species associated with more mesic stands (e.g., Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Fagus grandifolia). A similar replacement of putative climax species (e.g., Quercus alba) with A. rubrum occurred in understories of late-successional hardwood stands. In contrast with accepted successional models, these results are in line with mounting evidence of unanticipated and less predictable forest dynamics over the last century. Such changes could be the result of changing climate patterns or anthropogenic impacts. Regardless, more mechanistic experiments must be developed to determine the cause of these seemingly-widespread patterns to better inform global change and forestry models.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Sociocultural determinants of sleep, cognitive decline, and dementia among an intergenerational Latino cohort in the Sacramento, California region</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Latinos in the US face higher proportions of dementia. Understanding how acculturation relates to cognition may provide insight to the mechanistic pathways driving this disparity. High US acculturation, when compared to an orientation towards another birth/ancestral country, has been linked to some poor health outcomes and may negatively shape cognition through these pathways. Poor sleep is an important risk factor that has been largely unexplored among Latinos, though evidence suggests a disproportionate burden. We addressed three gaps in our understanding of the Latino cognitive disparity within an intergenerational Sacramento, California cohort: (1) sociocultural mechanisms and sleep; (2) sociocultural mechanisms, cognitive decline, and dementia; and (3) sleep, cognitive decline, and dementia, with ApoE-&#x3B5;4 genotype. Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging comprised older age generation 1 (GEN1) and Ni&#xF1;os Lifestyle &amp; Diabetes Study comprised middle-age generation 2 (GEN2).
      US acculturation may pattern sleep differentially by acculturative status of previous generations, socioeconomic context, and potentially age. High intergenerational US acculturation was associated with worse sleep among GEN2, but better sleep among GEN1. However, the beneficial association among GEN1 may be a function of lower SEP. Cognitive outcomes were explored among GEN1. High US acculturation was associated with better cognitive performance and reduced dementia/cognitive impairment, not dementia (CIND) risk. Fatigue was also associated with worse cognitive performance, but sleep, cognitive decline, or incident dementia/CIND were not associated in this population. However, sleep-cognition associations need to be assessed bi-directionally and in larger populations to gain a full understanding.
      High US acculturation may improve sleep and cognitive outcomes in low socioeconomic settings and acculturation across generations may differentially shape health, though a greater understanding of the underlying sociodemographic mechanisms is needed. If replicated, sociocultural pathways should be considered in sleep and cognitive research among Latinos. Pending further exploration of sleep and cognition, better sleep may link high US acculturation and improved cognitive outcomes. Future studies can build upon these findings as knowledge of broad sociocultural determinants can guide identification of modifiable intervention targets (e.g. sleep). Knowledge of a sociocultural framework can also guide the development of prevention and intervention efforts (e.g. community integration component).</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation studies one of Catalonia&#x2019;s most influential writers, Caterina Albert i Parad&#xED;s (pseudonym V&#xED;ctor Catal&#xE0;) (1869-1966), within the context of early-twentieth century Hispano-Catalan literary society. It demonstrates how, in a predominantly male profession, Albert/Catal&#xE0; and contemporary female writers in Spain and Latin America become the subjects of critical gossip and face gender-based critical restriction of their creative work. In the literary reception of these writers, allusions to their deviant bodies, gender identities, and sexualities distract and detract from more rigorous formal assessments of their works. I argue that Albert/Catal&#xE0; puts forth models of literary creation and methods of reception in her novels, short stories, and correspondence that function to defend her artistic liberty and to counter a culture of gendered critique. In this way, this dissertation shows how Albert&#x2019;s narrative methods of writing (and reading) worked to create a space for the creative expression of women writers in a rapidly modernizing nation. This research works to bridge the gap between Catalan and Spanish-language literature by calling attention to the contributions of a canonical author who remains&#x2014;despite her many achievements&#x2014;overlooked by critics in the Spanish and Anglo-American academies.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Two hypotheses were tested as triggering nasal effacement (leaving an aspiration contrast) in voiceless prenasalized stops in Bantu languages: 
      Aspiration is more reliably produced than voiceless nasalization. 
      Voiceless nasalization is harder to hear than aspiration.
      Productions from two Somali Chizigula speakers were measured to test the cue reliability of nasalization amplitude versus aspiration duration. Aspiration is a more reliably produced cue, providing better distinction between voiceless stops. 
      The perception of voiceless nasalization and aspiration by 10 Somali Chizigula participants was tested. Native productions of voiceless prenasalized and plain stops were cross-spliced to contain pre-burst information from one stop type and post-burst from the other. Participants then identified each stimulus as prenasalized or plain. 
      Nasalized-only stimuli were identified as &#x201C;prenasalized&#x201D; significantly less than control prenasalized stimuli, but aspirated-only stimuli did not receive significantly less &#x201C;prenasalized&#x201D; responses than prenasalized controls.
      Aspiration appears easier to hear, but not more heavily weighted than nasalization.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Prenatal exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) has been associated with adverse developmental and reproductive outcomes, and may be tied to altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the placenta. In this study, we investigated whether iAs exposure modulates GR signaling in placental cells. Trophoblast JEG-3 cells were exposed to environmentally-relevant doses of iAs and mRNA expression and DNA methylation were quantified. Results demonstrated that iAs exposure alters the expression of 12 GR-genes that play a role in fetal and placental development. Furthermore, supporting a role for the epigenome in control of this expression, the mRNA alterations were associated with changes in DNA methylation patterning in placental cells. The identified target genes have been implicated in associations with prenatal arsenic exposure, placental physiology, and fetal development. This study provides evidence of iAs as an endocrine disruptor and insight into the mechanisms by which prenatal iAs exposure induces adverse birth outcomes.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>THE COST-EFFFECTIVENESS OF IMPROVED COMMUNICATION OF PREGNANCY RISK AND CONTRACEPTIVE INFORMATION</dc:title>

          <dc:description>To prevent unplanned pregnancies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that women receive contraceptive counseling and suggests a contraceptive poster that it designed as one tool to accomplish this goal. However, the CDC poster has not been evaluated to determine whether it improves contraceptive knowledge or intentions. Furthermore, it was not developed with the input of patients. This project&#x2019;s overall objective was to fill these gaps in the literature by creating and evaluating a patient-centered poster designed to better communicate information about pregnancy risk and contraceptive effectiveness. My central hypothesis was that the patient-centered poster would be a more cost-effective and acceptable method of preventing unplanned pregnancies among women of reproductive age than the CDC poster. This project is innovative because it draws on women&#x2019;s insights to develop the poster.
       
      This project&#x2019;s first aim compared the comprehension, relevance, and acceptability of the two posters through cognitive interviews with N=26 women. The second aim compared how effectively the two posters changed: women&#x2019;s contraceptive knowledge, the accuracy of women&#x2019;s perceived pregnancy risk, and the effectiveness of the contraceptive methods women were most likely to use in the following year. We did this by conducting a randomized control trial of the posters in an Amazon Mechanical Turk sample of N=990 women. The third aim compared the cost-effectiveness of the two posters in comparison to the status quo. To do this, we created two Markov models using a private payer perspective. 
      In the first aim, we found that the final version of the patient-centered poster was preferred overall and in terms of comprehension and relevance by the majority of women. It generated few remaining acceptability issues. In the second aim, we found that the patient-centered poster improved contraceptive knowledge significantly more than the CDC poster, and both posters significantly improved the effectiveness of women&#x2019;s most likely contraceptive method. In the third aim, we found that both the patient-centered and the CDC poster reduced costs and improved health outcomes relative to the status quo. This project helps advance the CDC counseling recommendation and the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing unplanned pregnancies.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Lower extremity stiffness (KLeg) describes how subjects attenuate load during ground contact while completing dynamic tasks. Alterations in KLeg are associated with increased risk for lower extremity injury. Previous data suggests that lesser mobility during a clinical exam is associated with greater KLeg in healthy runners. The purpose of our study was to analyze the neuromechanical contributions to KLeg during running and hopping in healthy runners. Additionally we analyzed the relationship between running and hopping while also examining the feasibility of utilizing a waist-mounted accelerometer to estimate KLeg in a clinical setting. We analyzed 70 healthy runners with a 2 session cross-sectional study. We collected musculotendinous stiffness of the ankle plantarflexors and knee extensors in session 1. In session 2, we collected KLeg during self-selected running as well as single leg hopping at 3 frequencies (1.5 Hz, self-selected, 3.0 Hz).  We also collected waist-mounted accelerations as well as muscle activation of the ankle plantarflexors and knee extensors.  We found that at self-selected frequencies and higher, greater KLeg during single leg hopping is significantly associated with greater ankle plantarflexor musculotendinous stiffness, greater ankle plantarflexor muscle activation and greater hopping frequency. Greater KLeg during running is significantly associated with greater knee extensor musculotendinous stiffness, lesser hip internal range of motion and greater running velocity. We found that subjects who demonstrated greater KLeg during single leg hopping also demonstrated greater KLeg during running however this significant relationship was only minimal. Finally, our waist-mounted accelerometer significantly overestimated KLeg across all hopping frequencies. Out study found that active muscle contraction and greater musculotendinous stiffness of the ankle plantflexors and knee extensors are associated with greater KLeg during hopping and running, respectively. These may serve as rehabilitative targets to alter KLeg in the clinical setting. Additionally, assessing KLeg via hopping and with a waist-mounted accelerometer does not accurately reflect KLeg during running determine via motion capture. Additional studies should be completed to improve the clinical assessment of KLeg to reduce the occurrence of lower extremity injuries.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Low charge carrier mobility is a major obstacle that limits the performance of organic electronic devices. For conjugated polymers, increasing the contribution from intramolecular charge transport channels to overall charge transport is expected to increase the mobility of the overall device. This is because the transport of charge carriers along conjugated polymer backbones is expected to be much faster than transport between the polymers. However, designing devices that take advantage of intramolecular charge transport has proven difficult, and in virtually all organic electronic devices charge must travel not only along individual polymer backbones, but must hop inefficiently between polymers as well due to film morphology.
      Conjugated polymer brushes are films comprising densely packed conjugated polymers that are tethered to a substrate, causing the polymers to elongate creating a brush-like morphology. Due to their morphology, polymer brush devices are expected to exhibit enhanced intramolecular charge transport. Electronic devices can be made from polymer brush films by growing the polymer from a conducting substrate and attaching a metal electrode to the top of the brush film, forming the vertical electrode-polymer-electrode structure. These devices make it possible to investigate intramolecular charge transport processes, because each polymer which contacts the top electrode is also contacting the bottom electrode (i.e. the substrate).
      Polythiophene is a model conjugated polymer that has received extensive research interest as an active layer in organic electronic devices due to their electronic properties and environmental and thermal stability. In this work the morphology and electronic properties of poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) brushes are studied using the vertical electrode- polymer-electrode devices. The bulk resistivity of P3MT brush devices was found to be 1.4 &#x2217; 10^5 &#x3A9;&#x2212;cm, two orders of magnitude lower than that of spun cast films of comparable polythiophene films. The resistivity of the brush films has been analyzed on a per-molecule basis, and the resulting &#x201C;molecular resistivity&#x201D; value of 180 G&#x3A9;/nm is comparable to those obtained from transport studies of molecular wires. The significantly reduced bulk resistivity along with a molecular resistivity on par with molecular wires indicate an enhanced contribution from intramolecular charge transport in conjugated polymer brush devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Ties That Bind: Surrogate Representation in the United States House of Representatives</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In a 2015 interview with the Minnesota Post, U.S. House member Keith Ellison made the
      startling comment that he &#x201C;. . . didn&#x2019;t run for Congress to talk about my religion all the
      time. . . &#x201D;; instead he ran &#x201C;. . . to increase the minimum wage, strengthen the right to bargain
      collectively, to do something about climate change, to help students afford college.&#x201D;
      What is being described is surrogate representation&#x2014;an often understudied phenomenon
      in theories of American representation&#x2014;which is the link between a legislator and citizen
      where no formal electoral, and territorial, connection exists. Using an original method to
      identify the location of donors to members of the United States House of Representatives
      in 2016 I demonstrate the surrogate legislators have a higher percentage of their constituencies
      originating from outside their geographic district. This process is facilitated by speciail
      interested organizations, like EMILY&#x2019;s List which can increase a surrogate legislator&#x2019;s
      out-of-district constitueny even further. Surrogate legislators are attracting the attention of
      citizens across political boundaries and are seeing significant increases to the percentage
      of their campaign contributions that are coming from outside their congressional district,
      as a result. In effect, these legislators are redefining their constituencies to include both
      in-district and out-of-district citizens.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The continuity and change of Native Piedmont foodways during the Late Woodland (AD 800-1600) and Historic (after c. AD 1600) periods have been explored from several perspectives. In the larger context of piecing together the culture history of the southern Piedmont, however, there are still questions to be asked at the regional level. The current study builds on preexisting zooarchaeological research to identify patterns of subsistence practices within and among river basins before and during the process of cultural contact, spanning AD 1000-1710. Through a multi-scalar and geospatial meta-analysis of 22 faunal assemblages from 19 sites within the North Carolina and Virginia Piedmont, I ask how did past Native communities shape their animal economies to the particular environmental and cultural settings of the Piedmont during the Late Woodland and Historic Periods?</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Contributions of Hippocampal Area CA2 to Hippocampal Oscillatory Networks</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Complex cognitive abilities, such as memory, require synchronized neural activity across large populations of cells.  The hippocampus is a region of the brain required for the formation of long term episodic memories, which is our memory for autobiographical information.  The hippocampus itself consists of four sub-regions, the dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, CA2, and CA3, which can be viewed as functionally specialized processing hubs that uniquely contribute to memory formation based on their distinct molecular, synaptic, and anatomical properties.  Only together; however, does the collective activity of all four sub-regions provide the neurobiological underpinnings necessary for a functional memory system.   
      	One mechanism for the coordination of neural networks is synchronization through oscillations.  Neuronal oscillations reflect waves of synchronous action potentials and their presence in the hippocampus is strongly associated with episodic learning and memory. Although much progress been made towards understanding how different frequencies of activity are generated and how they support hippocampal-based memory, relatively little is known about the role of CA2 in organizing oscillations. In this dissertation work, I use combinatorial electrophysiological and chemogenetic approaches to genetically target and manipulate CA2 principal cells to investigate their role in coordinating hippocampal oscillatory networks in awake, behaving mice.
      	In Chapter 2, I use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to manipulate the endogenous G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in CA2 while animals explore a novel spatial environment. These experiments revealed that activation or inhibition of CA2 pyramidal cells through the endogenous Gq- and Gi-coupled pathways, respectively, is sufficient to bi-directionally modulate synchronized hippocampal activity in the slow gamma and beta frequency ranges.
      	In Chapter 3, I further dissect the role of CA2 in coordinating hippocampal oscillations by inhibiting CA2 pyramidal cells while animals investigate novel social stimuli and record from CA2&#x2019;s primary output region, CA1.  These experiments revealed that the oscillatory structure observed in CA1 is organized in a layer- and frequency-specific manner that depends causally on CA2 output.  These findings provide evidence that CA2 is an integral processing node capable of coordinating the hippocampal oscillatory networks that support long term episodic memory.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Model Implied Instrumental Variable Estimation for Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MCFA) models are most commonly estimated with full information maximum likelihood (FIML). FIML is asymptotically efficient and asymptotically unbiased given correct model specification and no excessive multivariate kurtosis.  When these assumptions are violated, we have no guarantee about the asymptotic properties of FIML.  In single level SEMs, the Model Implied Instrument Variable (MIIV-2SLS) estimator has been shown to be an excellent alternative to maximum likelihood. Following prior work for single level SEMs, this paper develops two MIIV-2SLS estimators for MCFA models. I evaluate both estimators in comparison to FIML with a Monte Carlo simulation study varying number of clusters, cluster size, distribution of data, balance of clusters and correct versus incorrect model specifications. Results suggest that both MIIV estimators are good alternatives to FIML across a variety of conditions. Most importantly, they are more robust to model misspecification and offer local tests of fit with Sargan&#x2019;s test. The primary limitation found in this simulation study suggests that these estimators may underestimate standard errors given small number of clusters, unbalanced clusters, and skew/kurtosis.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper proposes a general model of the government's choice of intellectual property rights protection given the structure of the import market and the distribution of consumers' incomes.  The model shows that the optimal level of protection chosen by the government, while most heavily influenced by institutional structures, differs depending on whether there is a competitive domestic fringe or a single domestic firm and on whether consumers' incomes are relatively equally or unequally distributed.  Measures of de facto and de jure intellectual property rights protection are used to test the implications of the models.
      The model is then extended to include local governments in trying to explain the divergence between the formal level of protection and the reality of protection in different localities.  Localities, in response to their constituents and their preferences for foreign actors, will choose to deviate from the federal level of protection, subject to the level of autonomy.  The federal government will take the chosen deviations and international obligations into consideration when choosing the federal level of protection.  These deviations are affected by the objective of domestic production: local consumption or export.
      Finally, the models are complemented by a country study of Jordan which examines more closely the effect of specific institutional structures in understanding one government's choice of protection.  The pharmaceutical industry in Jordan provides a compelling case study, as it is dependent upon intellectual property rights protection.  The level of protection increased markedly in 2000, following a distinct change in government policy in favor of foreign firms, moving Jordan from one of the worst to one of the best protectors of intellectual property rights protection in its region.  The country study uses the model to explain the levels of protection before and after this change in Jordan as compared to protection in institutionally similar countries.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Role of Positive Emotions in Perinatal Mental Health and Breastfeeding</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Major medical organizations in the U.S. recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continued breastfeeding through the first year or longer as desired by the woman and her infant. Public health programs have primarily aimed to increase breastfeeding duration and exclusivity without addressing the emotional experience of breastfeeding. Barbara Fredrickson&#x2019;s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that experiences of positive emotions lead to adaptive benefits by broadening thoughts and actions, facilitating the accrual of resources to improve health and well-being. In the context of the postpartum, this theory suggests that positive emotions experienced during infant feeding may broaden the scope of a mother&#x2019;s thoughts and actions, allowing her to build resources to cope with challenges.
      We used longitudinal data from the Mood, Mother and Infant cohort of women followed from the third trimester across the first year postpartum to test the extent to which positive emotions during infant feeding were associated with postpartum depression and anxiety and breastfeeding outcomes. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and time-to-event analyses to explore these associations, exploring modification by women&#x2019;s baseline psychopathology.
      Among women without a diagnosis of prenatal depression, positive emotions during feeding were inversely associated with postpartum depression symptoms. On the other hand, among women with a diagnosis of prenatal anxiety, positive emotions were associated with significantly lower postpartum anxiety symptoms. We speculate that women with prenatal anxiety who neverthess enjoy the experience of infant feeding may benefit from anxiolytic effects of oxytocin during breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction.
      Positive emotions were not significantly associated with time to any breast milk feeding cessation; however, positive emotions were significantly associated with a longer time to exclusive breast milk feeding cessation and with a better overall maternal breastfeeding experience, especially with dimensions of maternal enjoyment, role attainment, and lifestyle compatibility. Positive feelings about breastfeeding in the first week were similarly associated with breastfeeding outcomes, suggesting the importance of the early maternal experience of breastfeeding on long-term outcomes. 
      Mother-centered programs and policies that support the experiential aspects of infant feeding may improve postpartum mental health, breastfeeding rates, and maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Pain-related Disability Among People with Chronic Orofacial Pain
      High pain-related disability diminishes quality of life and increases health care costs. This study evaluated characteristics discriminating between high and low pain-related and examined the relationship between factors associated with pain-related disability among people with chronic painful temporomandibular disorder (TMD).
      We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a community-based sample of 1088 individuals with chronic TMD who completed standardized questionnaires assessing four domains: 1) sociodemographic, 2) psychological distress, 3) clinical pain, and 4) experimental pain. We used high pain-related disability, classified using the Graded Chronic Pain Scale, as the dependent variable in logistic regression modeling to evaluate contributions of variables from each domain. Cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC) quantified model discrimination. 
      We re-validated this measure of pain-related disability and created measurement models of TMD clinical features, psychological distress, and experimental pain sensitivity. Latent variables were combined for a full structural equation model that was crafted with exploratory model changes.
      Participants were 18-44 years old (mean 29.2, SD + 7.8) with a mean duration of 6.9 (6.4) years of chronic TMD. A third of participants had high pain-related disability. An 18-variable model encompassing all four domains had good discrimination (AUC=0.79 95% CI 0.75,0.82), as did a simplified model (sociodemographic variables plus catastrophizing, jaw limitation, and number of painful body sites: AUC=0.79 95% CI 0.76,0.82). Duration of pain, gender, and experimental pain testing results were not predictive.
      Our structural equation model of pain-related disability, TMD features, and psychological distress was created and refined based on exploratory model revisions. Estimation of the final model indicated a good fit with the data. TMD clinical features and psychological distress predicted pain-related disability but experimental pain sensitivity did not. The final model explained 78% of the variance in pain-related disability.
      High-impact chronic pain is a common problem among people with painful TMD. Assessment of characteristics associated with high-impact pain can be easily performed to identify modifiable risk factors and reduce high-impact pain. TMD clinical features (specifically jaw limitation) and psychological distress (including negative affect, somatization, and catastrophizing) should be considered by clinicians and researchers addressing pain-related disability.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This dissertation examines how Creoles of color from the Civil War to the end of the nineteenth century advocated for racial equality through the desegregation of public institutions in New Orleans. Previous scholarship has emphasized how Creoles&#x2019; class and ethnic identities as francophone transatlantic free people of color shaped their political activism. My dissertation argues that the significances of Creoles of color extends beyond these roots because their desegregation ideology served a common cause for all people; they built coalitions with Anglicized blacks and white radicals, and expanded their efforts beyond male participants to include women and children. Creoles of color succeeded in incorporating their desegregation agenda into the Republican Party&#x2019;s platform in Louisiana during Reconstruction. Furthermore, they were able to lead anti-Jim Crow protests into the 1890s, which culminated in challenging the 1890 Louisiana separate car act in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson United States Supreme Court case. This dissertation specifically focuses on Creoles&#x2019; everyday struggles through the lens of public schools, transportation, and churches. By combining archival research and digital methodologies, it portrays Creole community members&#x2019; desegregation activism and explains how their shifting relationships with the Anglicized black population and white radicals shaped their civil rights movement that persisted for nearly four decades in late nineteenth century New Orleans.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT
      Rachel Anne Norman: Multilingual Arabesques in the Novel in North America
      (Under the direction of Mar&#xED;a DeGuzm&#xE1;n)
      &#x201C;Multilingual Arabesques&#x201D; examines the literary and linguistic constructions of identity in the Arab diaspora in North America. Novels, and the languages used to write them, are cardinal spaces of cultural belonging. Arab North Americans&#x2019; inclusion (or not) of Arabic in their fiction establishes a linguistic identity that situates characters, texts, and authors within and beyond national spaces. By comparing representations of Arabic as a &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; language in novels from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, this dissertation argues that Arab diasporic writers invoke language to perform identity in contextually contingent ways. Within the United States and Canada, Arabs are socially constructed as &#x201C;enemy,&#x201D; &#x201C;other,&#x201D; and &#x201C;fanatical terrorist,&#x201D; and authors claim ethnic and national belonging through representations of code-switching and translingualism that powerfully contest and transform the spatial hegemony of the nation-state. Absent the same historical constructions of race, Mexico figures Arab immigrants as corrupt businessmen out to cheat &#x201C;real&#x201D; Mexicans. Arab Mexican authors variously utilize Arabic not as a tool to modify the nation but rather to create a linguistic space that stands outside geography. Chapter 1 explores the form and function of the intersections between language and identity categories like ethnicity, race, nation, class, gender, and sexuality. Continuing the discussion of gender, Chapter 2 argues that an Arab diasporic identity is inscribed within the female body through the cultural resources of food and language, while Chapter 3 suggests that queer Arab American characters inhabiting non-normative narrative structures challenge homonational global politics. Finally, Chapter 4 elucidates how authors manipulate language to normalize the presence of Arabic and Arab bodies by inserting Arabic into the linguistic landscape of North America. Although the Arab linguistic production of identity differs between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, all three Arab immigrant communities enlist language in the rhetorical and material pursuit of belonging. The first study in the field to compare nationally and linguistically diverse Arab diasporic texts, &#x201C;Multilingual Arabesques&#x201D; helps us to understand critical points of continuity and rupture within the Arab diaspora in North America.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Protecting American Health from Climate Change:  What is needed to expand adaptation planning by U.S. state and local health departments?</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Over the last decade, there have been growing calls for national and local governments to adapt to a changing climate to protect human health.  Due to the shift in U.S. federal climate policy under the Trump Administration, leadership for this climate and health adaptation rests increasingly among state, local and tribal health authorities.  These authorities need effective strategies for planning climate and health adaptation in funding-constrained environments. This study proposes an adapted model for planning climate and health adaptation among state and local health departments, based on a review of existing efforts in the U.S., with a particular focus on the U.S. CDC&#x2019;s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) model employed in the CDC-funded Climate Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI).    
      Study methods comprised: a literature review of existing adaptation efforts in the U.S.; analysis of 11 CDC interviews with CRSCI grantees; and 11 online, videoconference focus group discussions with 46 city and county health officials. The study characterizes the key inputs and processes involved in BRACE implementation by 9 states and 2 cities, revealing key challenges and enabling factors that influenced successful climate and health adaptation planning.  The study also summarizes the input of health authorities on operational requirements to expand climate and health adaptation at state and local levels, and their recommendations for an adapted BRACE model.  Lastly, the study proposes an adapted BRACE model for state and local health departments facing resource constraints, and recommendations for how CDC and the broader health community can advance climate and health adaptation nationwide.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>FRAILTY PREVALENCE, ONE-YEAR RISK, AND THE EFFECT OF SMOKING AMONG WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT HIV INFECTION</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The gap in life expectancy between people with HIV and the general population is diminishing. However, evidence suggests that people with HIV may be experiencing aging-related conditions at earlier ages. The objective of this dissertation was to estimate the prevalence of frailty, a syndrome of physical vulnerability, estimate the one-year risk of frailty, and examine the effect of smoking on the one-year risk of frailty among women with and at risk for HIV. This project used data from the Women&#x2019;s Interagency HIV Study between October 2015 and September 2017. The Fried Frailty Index was used to define frail status as exceeding the threshold for at least three of five frailty components: slowness, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. Among 1,404 women with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range: 47-57), we found that frailty prevalence was 11.5% (15.3% HIV-, 10.1% HIV+). The most common frailty components were low physical activity and exhaustion. The one-year risk of frailty was 6.6% (95% confidence interval: 4.1, 9.1) and similar for women with and without HIV. After adjustment for confounding, current smokers were 1.68 times as likely to become frail compared to non-smokers (95% CI: 0.69, 4.06). Women with high cumulative smoking exposure were 2.72 times as likely to become frail compared to women with low cumulative smoking exposure (95% CI: 0.96, 7.67), and this latter effect appeared to be more pronounced among women with HIV (adjusted RR = 4.10; 95% CI: 1.22, 13.78). In a low income, predominately black population of women in their mid-fifties with and without HIV infection, the prevalence and risk of frailty is comparable to women in the general population at least 65 years old. Reported smoking exposure is independently associated with increased frailty risk in this population, even over a one-year period of follow-up. These findings demonstrate that modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, could play a crucial role in preventing frailty, especially among people with HIV. Future studies are needed to investigate trends in frailty risk over time and to examine the long-term impacts of smoking on frailty among people with HIV.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Plancental Microbes as an Indicator of Neurocognitive Outcomes in Children Born Preterm</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Prenatal exposure to various stressors can influence both early and later childhood health. Microbial infection of the intrauterine environment, and specifically within the placenta, has been associated with deleterious pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth. Children that are born prematurely experience a higher rate of developmental problems throughout their lives, including neurocognitive impairment which persists into school-age and manifests as poor performance in school. The relationships among microorganisms in the placenta, placental function and fetal development are not well understood. Microorganisms have been associated with epigenetic modifications in other tissue types and are known to trigger an inflammatory response. Inflammatory proteins can damage the developing fetal brain. 
      This goal of this research was to explore microorganisms in preterm placentas, their association with inflammation and DNA methylation, as well as later-life neurocognitive function. Using data from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort we assessed the relationship between 15 microorganisms and three outcomes: (1) neurocognitive and social-communicative outcomes at age 10, (2) genome-wide DNA CpG methylation of the placenta, and (3) placental mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes.  Through these studies we demonstrated that different bacterial species have differential effects on the placenta and the child. The presence of certain microorganisms in the placenta were associated with neurocognitive delays at age 10. In contrast, the presence of Lactobacillus sp. was associated with a lower risk of impaired neurocognitive functions. In the placenta, we found that the presence of bacteria led to differential methylation of 1,789 CpG sites, corresponding to 1,079 genes. The altered genes encode for proteins that are involved in immune/inflammatory responses, specifically the NF-&#x3BA;B signaling pathway. Through evaluation of mRNA expression, we discovered that in the presence of certain bacteria there was an upregulation of inflammation-related genes. Taken together, these findings increase the understanding of mechanisms by which microbial presence in the placenta contributes to the outcomes of the children later in life.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Cholera outbreaks may be mitigated by monitoring drinking waters for the bacterial disease agent, Vibrio cholerae. Present microbial methods for V. cholerae require advanced training and specialized equipment; these methods may not be appropriate for low-resource settings most vulnerable to cholera outbreaks. Our team hypothesized that the Aquagenx Compartment Bag Test (CBT) kit could be adapted for the direct detection and quantification of V. cholerae in drinking water in field settings. The present study evaluates selective culture media for adapted field use. The results of this study suggest that previously-described and commercially-available media are limited in specificity, exclusivity, and plating efficiency. We propose new selective broth culture media for use with the CBT. Preliminary results suggest that newly-proposed media demonstrate improved exclusivity over other existing culture media. These results support the further examination of broth media for direct quantification of V. cholerae with an adapted Cholera CBT.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Abjective Conflict Among Mixed Race Mother-Daughter Dyads in Modern and Contemporary U.S. Women&#x2019;s Prose</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Many U.S. women&#x2019;s narratives of mixed race mother-daughter conflict suggest race-based abjection as a primary factor. Mothers and daughters develop a horror&#x2014;sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle&#x2014;of their respective others&#x2019; racial identifications and try to reject them, but often prove unable to separate entirely, remaining instead in fraught relationships.
      	This study examines race-based abjection between mothers and their differently raced daughters in multiple iterations. &#x201C;Chapter 1: Secret Mother&#x201D; begins in the Jim Crow era and tells the story of Norma Storch, an aspiring actress who had a daughter with a black comedian. Fearing the socioeconomic consequences of being a white woman known to have non-white offspring, Storch sent the girl to live with a black family. Storch remained part of her daughter&#x2019;s life, but refused for nearly forty years to acknowledge their biological relationship publicly. &#x201C;Chapter 2: Secret Daughter&#x201D; flips the narrative and explains how that daughter, acclaimed journalist and documentarian June Cross, responded to her mother&#x2019;s abjection with race-based abjection of her own. 
      	&#x201C;Chapter 3: Secret Genealogy&#x201D; turns to Louise Erdrich&#x2019;s iconic Pauline &#x201C;Sister Leopolda&#x201D; Puyat character and shows how she simultaneously embodies both maternal and filial race-based abjection. Puyat constructs a racial identity that rejects both her mother and her daughter as Indian, but considers herself white. Finally, &#x201C;Chapter 4: Secret Abjection&#x201D; demonstrates how race-based abjection between mother and daughter evolved after Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 Supreme Court ruling that legalized interracial marriage. After Loving, mixed race mother-daughter dyads had little need to separate physically. Instead, in the cases of Elizabeth and Ruby in Joan Steinau Lester&#x2019;s Mama&#x2019;s Child, Sandy and Birdie in Danzy Senna&#x2019;s Caucasia, and real-life author-activists Alice and Rebecca Walker, race-based abjection led mothers to objectify their daughters and vice versa.
      	This project problematizes both long-standing and contemporary narratives that mixed race people and relationships inevitably lead to greater racial harmony. It rejects romanticization and deepens current conversations in Critical Mixed Race Studies, Women&#x2019;s Studies, and Contemporary American Literature by highlighting the significant societal and psychological obstacles facing women who raise differently raced daughters, and those facing the daughters themselves, in U.S. society.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>To assess the effects of prolonged sitting on measures of arterial stiffness (AS) and circulating angiogenic cells (CAC), healthy but sedentary subjects completed 3 hours of sitting in a randomized crossover design with 10 calf raises every ten minutes (CALF) or a control condition (CON). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis (PWA) and blood draws were performed pre and post to assess AS. CACs were isolated from venous blood for analysis. PWV significantly increased (Mean Difference [MD]0.30 m/s (0.46), p&lt;0.01) and augmentation index (AIx) from PWA significantly decreased from pre-to post (MD=-9.14% (11.09), p&lt;0.001). There was no significant change in CAC counts per 500,000 events or gene expression in either condition across time. In conclusion, aortic AS increases during sitting despite decreases in arterial wave reflection, and local changes observed previously with physical activity do not persist systemically.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Larval nutrition, temperature, and geographic divergence of Pieris butterflies</dc:title>

          <dc:description>For insects and other ectotherms, temperature and nutrient availability are particularly important factors influencing selection because feeding and growth are temperature dependent. The temperature experienced during larval development affects growth and developmental rates and adult body size for many insects, and nutrient availability affects key aspects of insect growth, physiology and life history. Therefore, interactions of temperature with nutrient availability can strongly influence life history outcomes. My second, third, and fourth chapters investigate these interactive effects of temperature and nutrition on short-term physiology and long-term life history traits as well as behavior of the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) larvae. Specifically, chapters two and three compare how these factors combine to influence two invasive, geographically divergent North American populations. I used fertilized host plants to examine the effects of nutritional quantity and an artificial diet varying in macronutrient ratio to examine the effects of nutritional quality. The fourth chapter investigates how macronutrient ratio influences acclimation and behavior in this species. When fed host plants, increased fertilization improved larval performance in both populations but the high latitude population showed greater temperature sensitivity. When fed artificial diets, I found greater temperature sensitivity in the low latitude population on poor-quality, low protein diet such that few individuals survived to pupation. These experiments demonstrate that temperature effects are strongly influenced by nutrition and that this interaction differs between divergent populations. Additionally, I found that nutrition can influence behavioral choice of macronutrients in this species. In my fifth chapter, I used whole host plants to compare the effects an invasive and native plant species have on oviposition and larval performance of the native West Virginia white butterfly (Pieris virginiensis). I found that an exposed and unexposed population did not differ in their interactions with the invasive plant, but that there is a strong seasonal component to oviposition preference due to differing phenologies of the host plants.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Robots that Learn and Plan &#x2014; Unifying Robot Learning and Motion Planning for Generalized Task Execution</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Robots have the potential to assist people with a variety of everyday tasks, but to achieve that potential robots require software capable of planning and executing motions in cluttered environments.  To address this, over the past few decades, roboticists have developed numerous methods for planning motions to avoid obstacles with increasingly stronger guarantees, from probabilistic completeness to asymptotic optimality.  Some of these methods have even considered the types of constraints that must be satisfied to perform useful tasks, but these constraints must generally be manually specified.  In recent years, there has been a resurgence of methods for automatic learning of tasks from human-provided demonstrations.  Unfortunately, these two fields, task learning and motion planning, have evolved largely separate from one another, and the learned models are often not usable by motion planners.
      In this thesis, we aim to bridge the gap between robot task learning and motion planning by employing a learned task model that can subsequently be leveraged by an asymptotically-optimal motion planner to autonomously execute the task.  First, we show that application of a motion planner enables task performance while avoiding novel obstacles and extend this to dynamic environments by replanning at reactive rates.  Second, we generalize the method to accommodate time-invariant model parameters, allowing more information to be gleaned from the demonstrations.  Third, we describe a more principled approach to temporal registration for such learning methods that mirrors the ultimate integration with a motion planner and often reduces the number of demonstrations required.
      Finally, we extend this framework to the domain of mobile manipulation.  We empirically evaluate each of these contributions on multiple household tasks using the Aldebaran Nao, Rethink Robotics Baxter, and Fetch mobile manipulator robots to show that these approaches improve task execution success rates and reduce the amount of human-provided information required.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Scaling An Evidence-Based Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Demand Creation Intervention For Adolescents In Sub-Saharan Africa</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Approximately 70% of all new HIV infections occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 25 million people are living with HIV. Clinical trials have shown that voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) can reduce female-to-male transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan African countries by up to 60%. UNAIDS and the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa as VMMC priority countries, as these nations have generally low circumcision coverage and high HIV prevalence rates. Since 2007, nearly 11.6 million males in these countries have undergone VMMC, demonstrating great progress has been made in scaling up VMMC services. However, an estimated 9.4 million circumcisions are still needed to achieve the 80% coverage target.  To fill this gap, demand creation interventions are needed to provide education, motivation, and support to encourage men and adolescent boys to undergo the procedure.  
      This study includes a literature review of all completed randomized controlled trials on VMMC demand creation. This review found interventions such as interpersonal communication, incentives, and sport-based approaches have produced encouraging evidence of increased demand for VMMC; however, none of these evidence-based interventions appear to have been scaled to regional or national levels beyond the successful trials. Building on these findings, this study utilized key informant interviews (n=26) with a range of stakeholders to establish key criteria for scaling evidence-based VMMC demand creation interventions, with an emphasis on scaling adolescent interventions. This study generated findings useful to policymakers, donors, and implementing organizations as they design strategies for scaling VMMC demand-creation interventions.  
      	Findings suggest that scalable VMMC demand creation interventions should: (1) utilize ongoing collection of programmatic data to become more affordable, reach larger numbers, and iteratively improve quality; (2) implement a targeted approach to address individual barriers to VMMC uptake; and (3) continually evolve and innovate to stay relevant and effective. 
      	This study found it is critical to take a &#x201C;consortium approach&#x201D; to scaling VMMC demand creation interventions. In the consortium approach, African government ministries, community members, implementing organizations, and donors participate in meaningful engagement from the &#x201C;pre-planning&#x201D; phase through scale-up. The Ministry of Education and parents were identified as important stakeholders when scaling adolescent interventions.  
      	VMMC conversion rate, absolute VMMC uptake, cost effectiveness, ongoing quality assurance, and changes in norms and values were identified as key metrics to assess impact and effectiveness of VMMC demand creation interventions at scale. 
      	Key informants identified barriers to scaling VMMC demand creation interventions including difficult funding structures, challenges engaging government, and supply side barriers related to availability and quality of services.  Parental consent was identified as a key barrier to scaling of adolescent VMMC demand creation interventions.
      Key informants described VMMC strategies as transitioning from an emergency approach to a maintenance approach as several countries make progress towards VMMC coverage and VMMC becomes integrated into a wider package of health services. To sustain current circumcision coverage, circumcision strategies will likely shift focus from the general population of males to adolescent boys and infants. Additionally, government adoption was identified as a pathway to sustainability of VMMC demand creation interventions, yet key informants were skeptical that governments would fully take on all activities, including funding, implementation and evaluation.  Furthermore, funding for VMMC is likely to change in the coming years; in response, demand creation interventions will need to find new funding sources outside PEPFAR, including private sector funding.  
      	Findings from this study have informed a Plan For Change for Grassroot Soccer, a sport-based adolescent health organization that seeks to scale its evidence-based VMMC demand creation intervention for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>REAL-TIME SCHEDULING ON ASYMMETRIC MULTIPROCESSOR PLATFORMS</dc:title>
          <dc:date>2018-01-01T05:00:00Z</dc:date>

          <dc:description>Real-time scheduling analysis is crucial for time-critical systems, in which provable timing guarantees are more important than observed raw performance. Techniques for real-time scheduling analysis initially targeted uniprocessor platforms but have since evolved to encompass multiprocessor platforms. However, work directed at multiprocessors has largely focused on symmetric platforms, in which every processor is identical. Today, it is common for a multiprocessor to include heterogeneous processing elements, as this offers advantages with respect to size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations. As a result, realizing modern real-time systems on asymmetric multiprocessor platforms is an inevitable trend. Unfortunately, principles and mechanisms regarding real-time scheduling on such platforms are relatively lacking.
      The goal of this dissertation is to enrich such principles and mechanisms, by bridging existing analysis for symmetric multiprocessor platforms to asymmetric ones and by developing new techniques that are unique for asymmetric multiprocessor platforms. The specific contributions are threefold.
      First, for a platform consisting of processors that differ with respect to processing speeds only, this dissertation shows that the preemptive global earliest-deadline-first (G-EDF) scheduler is optimal for scheduling soft real-time (SRT) task systems. Furthermore, it shows that semi-partitioned scheduling, which is a hybrid of conventional global and partitioned scheduling approaches, can be applied to optimally schedule both hard real-time (HRT) and SRT task systems. 
      Second, on platforms that consist of processors with different functionalities, tasks that belong to different functionalities may process the same source data consecutively and therefore have producer/consumer relationships among them, which are represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). End-to-end response-time bounds for such DAGs are derived in this dissertation under a G-EDF-based scheduling approach, and it is shown that such bounds can be improved by a linear-programming-based deadline-setting technique.
      Third, processor virtualization can lead a symmetric physical platform to be asymmetric. In fact, for a designated virtual-platform capacity, there exist an infinite number of allocation schemes for virtual processors and a choice must be made. In this dissertation, a particular asymmetric virtual-processor allocation scheme, called minimum-parallelism (MP) form, is shown to dominate all other schemes including symmetric ones.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Shifting Frames, Shifting Policy: How Frame Sets Influence Policy Making in Congress</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In this dissertation, I pose and answer three questions about the presence and role of policy discussion in Congress: (1) why are some issues discussed more in the House and Senate than others; (2) do the parties differ in how they discuss issues; and (3) why does that discussion influence bill outcomes? First, I posit and show that parties are reactive to each other and pursuit of electoral goals influence how much a general policy area is discussed. Additionally, I show that, while the relationships appear to be the same across the two chambers of Congress, they are conditioned by majority party status.
      Second, I posit and show that pursuit of the party&#x2019;s electoral goal not only informs how much different issues are discussed, but also informs how they are discussed. I show that the parties differ in which frames they use to discuss policy. In doing so, I present a new measure of frames in Congress that using a set list of broad frames that facilitates comparisons across policy areas.
      Finally, building from the first and second questions, I question whether the policy discussion that occurs influences bill outcomes. I propose that the construction of policy discussion through the selection of frames shapes the considerations of those evaluating proposed legislation, which ultimately influences action (i.e. voting) in Congress. In doing this, I shift the focus from the use of individual frames and their characteristics to the concept of the frame set, a holistic look at how the issue is framed. Following from this, I posit and show that as the frame set changes more, policy change (i.e. bill passage) is more likely.
      To test these claims, I rely on large-N empirical analysis. I code the speeches in the Congressional Record for the Comparative Agendas Project general policy areas using supervised machine learning. Then, using unsupervised machine learning, I code the paragraphs within the speeches on policy for how it discusses that policy area, the frame used.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>What is Civil Society? Can we assess how strong it is? Using the problems present conceptualizations of civil society entail as a point of departure, this work develops a definition that strips civil society of its normative assumptions and functional form and fits better with the reality we observe. Civil society can be thought of as a space between the state, the market, and the family that can be divided into different sectors based on the goals of the civil organizations that inhabit it. The strength of each sector can be assessed by gauging how cohesive civil society organizations within that sector are, how embedded they are in the social fabric of society, and how developed their bureaucratic capital is. This work then sketches out how this approach can be used to analyze civil society in the United States and Armenia. In sum, it presents the basis for a new research agenda aims to investigate the relationship between civil society and democracy.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: The hallmark sign of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is cartilage damage. Patients with knee OA present impulse loading, co-activation of knee musculature, and somatosensory deficits have been. These characteristics could be precursors rather than disease outcomes. Purpose: to evaluate associations between vibratory sensation (VPT), quadriceps and hamstring co-activation, and percent change of cartilage cross-sectional area (CSA) in healthy population. Methods: VPT was measured, participants performed walking trial where co-activation was measured, and pre/post ultrasound cartilage images were collected. Pearson product (r) determined associations between VPT, co-activaiton indices, and change in CSA.  Results: 31 participants (age=22(2.5)years, height=1.71(0.15)m weight=74.9(11.8)kg) completed this study. Significant associations between medial and composite co-activation index and change in CSA (r=0.031, p=0.009), between lateral malleolus VPT and co-activation indices laterally during PRE-phase of gait, and composite during LA (r=-0.443,p=0.014 and r=0.415, p=0.023) were found. Discussion: Greater co-activation during gait may be associated with changes in knee cartilage.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Integrative analysis is of great interest in modern scientific research. This dissertation mainly focuses on developing new statistical methods for integrative analysis.
      We first discuss a clustering analysis of a microbiome dataset in combination with phylogenetic information. Discovering disease related pneumotypes of the infected lower lung is difficult because the lower lung typically has few species of microbes and there is a low level of overlap from patient- to-patient, which makes it hard to calculate reliable distances between patients. We address this challenge by incorporating information from phylogenetic relationships, which results in improved clustering. When applied to an existing dataset, the method produces statistically distinct, easily described pneumotypes, which are better than those from standard approaches.
      In the second part, we discuss an integrative analysis of disparate data blocks measured on a common set of experimental subjects. We introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Detailed comparison between AJIVE and competitors is discussed using a particular optimization view point.
      In the third part, we introduce a new perturbation framework, which estimates the angle between an arbitrary given direction and the underlying signal spaces. We also propose an efficient data-driven bootstrap procedure to compute this angle. While the Wedin bound in the AJIVE is &#x201C;subspace oriented&#x201D; and uniform for both row space and column space, this angle is &#x201C;direction oriented&#x201D; and specially adaptive to give improved inference in the row space.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>With the prevalence of high dimensional data, variable selection is crucial in many real applications. Although various methods have been investigated in the past decades, challenges still remain when tens of thousands of predictor variables are available for modeling. One difficulty arises from the spurious correlation, referring to the phenomenon that the sample correlation between two variables can be large when the dimension is relatively high even if they are independent. While many classical variable selection methods choose a variable based upon its marginal correlation with the response, the existence of spurious correlation may result in a high false discovery rate. On the other hand, when important variables are highly correlated, it is desirable to include all of them into the model. However, there is no such guarantee in many existing methods. Another challenge is in most variable selection approaches one needs to implement model selection to control the model complexity. While cross-validation is commonly used, it is computationally expensive and lacks statistical interpretation. In this proposal, we introduce some novel variable selection approaches to address the challenges mentioned above. Our proposed methods are based upon the investigations on the limiting distribution of the spurious correlation. For the first project, we study the maximal absolute sample partial correlation between the covariates and the response, and introduce a testing-based variable selection procedure. In the second project, we take advantage of the asymptotic results of the maximal absolute sample correlation among covariates and incorporate them into a penalized variable selection approach. The third project considers applications of the asymptotic results in multiple-response regression. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Material and Social Costs of Roman Warfare in the Third and Second Centuries B.C.E.</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This dissertation examines the causes of Roman military success and expansion beyond Italy, focusing on the initial period of expansion from the First Punic War (264 B.C.E.) to the defeat of the Cimbri (101 B.C.E.).  I argue that, while the current demographic explanation of Roman success in this period, which focuses on seemingly inexhaustible Roman manpower, has validity, it represents only part of a solution which must also include the Roman ability to efficiently mobilize and organize the resources of Italy for warfare.  Through the examination and comparison of battlefield equipment recovered archaeologically and described in literary sources, this project investigates the cost of Roman military mat&#xE9;riel.  This project also seeks to situate that mat&#xE9;riel cost in the context of Rome&#x2019;s major rivals in this period in order to show that Rome was able to mobilize comparatively more resources for warfare, both generally and on a per-soldier basis, beyond the established advantage of its manpower.  This approach is further extended to include naval warfare, particularly during the First Punic War, by combining the recorded figures for the year-to-year fleet strengths of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets with comparative evidence from the classical Athenian navy to produce rough estimates of the total cost of naval operations.  The result of these investigations is to show that Rome&#x2019;s advantage in this period extended beyond manpower to include a superior ability to mobilize a broad range of economic resources.  Finally, this project seeks to investigate the sources for this Roman advantage in resource mobilization.  It suggests that the ability of the Roman Republic to marshal such vast reserves was due to the translation of the social institution of clientela into a blueprint for the inter-communal system of alliances in Italy, which in turn enabled Rome to efficiently and extensively harness the economic and demographic power of Italy.  Rome&#x2019;s rivals were not able to extract revenue and manpower from their own holdings as efficiently, leading to a decisive Roman military advantage.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Positional malalignment of the sacroiliac joint is a proposed mechanism of non-specific low back pain and a risk factor for lower extremity injury due to theoretical effects on hip range of motion. The Postural Restoration Institute&#x2122; (PRI) has introduced novel techniques for assessment and correction of these positional malalignments. Twenty-four subjects displaying a left anterior innominate rotation, as defined by the PRI, participated in two data collection sessions: a control session and an intervention session, where each subject completed a three-exercise pelvic repositioning series. Sagittal and transverse innominate rotation, measured by palpation-digitization, and hip range of motion were collected at three time-points in each session: before intervention, after intervention, and after walking one half-mile. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine interaction of session and time-point. A significant interaction (p = .000) between session and time-point was seen in left adduction range of motion and left total arc frontal plane range of motion. No interaction was observed in the sagittal or transverse innominate rotation angles. This finding supports the PRI&#x2019;s claim that left adduction range of motion can be increased through use of their repositioning series and provides support for clinical use of this technique in the treatment of hip and low back pain.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The public health response to the opioid overdose epidemic of the last 20 years has focused on supply, demand, and harm reduction strategies to address initiation, use, addiction, and overdose. Among the most highly promoted strategies to reduce demand for opioid analgesics and illicit opioids is medication assisted treatment utilizing an opioid agonist, particularly the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine. This dissertation research addressed two separate questions related to statewide utilization of buprenorphine within North Carolina.
      We conducted a historical cohort study with a time-to-event analysis of buprenorphine initiation among all opioid analgesic patients residing in North Carolina, using 2011-2015 prescription monitoring data. We identified a strong association between the total number of controlled substance prescribers patients utilized and the initiation of buprenorphine (HR for patients with 6 or more relative to 1: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57). Increasing levels of opioid exposure were also associated with buprenorphine initiation (HR in highest decile relative to lowest: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70, 5.42). This suggests that patients with multiple healthcare interactions and high opioid exposure are more likely to initiate treatment. Future research should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health records.
      Project Lazarus was a statewide community coalition-based effort to address opioid use and overdose through 7 distinct strategies targeting both communities and healthcare providers. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis cohort study of opioid analgesic dispensing and buprenorphine utilization in all counties in the state before and during the period of funded Project Lazarus activity. Only Project Lazarus-supported diversion control efforts were associated with an increase in opioid analgesic dispensing (IRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09). Policy changes addressing addiction treatment expansions did not appreciably increase buprenorphine utilization (IRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.06). These results are consistent with previous findings of limited impact of the Project Lazarus strategies on opioid overdose morbidity and mortality. Future studies should analyze the uptake of medication assisted treatment by treating community coalition activity as an effect modifier of existing institutional barriers.
      These longitudinal cohort studies provide insight into clinical and community-based efforts to utilize buprenorphine for outpatient treatment of opioid use disorder.</dc:description>
