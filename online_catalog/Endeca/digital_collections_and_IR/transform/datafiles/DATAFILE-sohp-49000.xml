<dc:description>This is Ben Bulla interviewing NANCY L. BRADSHAW who was Senator Jordan&#x27;s  Legislative Assistant ior many years. Washington, D. C  January 8, 1983 BB:  Tell me a bit about your background Nancy. NB:  I&#x27;m from Wilmington, I grew up there, then- 1 went to Wake Forest, wmU graduated,and came to Washington to look for a job,  I started to wo rkfabout two weeks after graduation.(in Senator Jordan&#x27;s offic^).

NB:  I actually came to Washington t?o tvy&gt; to find a job in a law firm&#x27; and 4&#x27;0awc by Senator Jordan&#x27;s office on the recommendation of a friend, Mon Mclver, whe wfto the uncle of my college roommate. BB:  Who interviewed you for the job? Bill. Would you tell me what your duties were? NB BB: NB: gradually took on oom letter writing responsibilities and then some fef. I started as    *._________secretary and I worked with Bill^and legislative responsibilities.  I would go to the Agriculture Committee meetings, which I really enjoyed\)hearw*g the**talk about the bills and 0v*fu*. Wkw*  working on the legislation. BB:  What did you actually do in the legislative p~art of your work? NB:  Wr-frfr mainly mm  of us answered corresnondence^xb*k in those days /Z#/f-       A** v **+ the subject areas were divided up and each*person did^taoi* own research and prepared draft letters for the Senator&#x27;s signature.  We would also go to fc4re committee meetings and b##$ +~  **&quot; executive sessions, and make our recommendations about the bills, 7.7S::&#x27;-r.zzrjh.::.::::::::-;::.&quot;r.:: Nancy L. Bradshaw                                 -2- BB:  Did you do research work for him on various bills? NB:  v~~^ T think vr Md   h&quot;&quot;v t&amp;m BB:  He didn&#x27;t have time to do all that reading, I know, so who read all the reports and material he had to read.  Did you read and then inform him? NB:  Yes. BB:  When did you find time; during office hours or did you catch him in the hallway somewhere. NB:  Wdl I lliinl* we would j-w#$ talk to him as we could get him,  The Senators track then were ~n1,]r, ia g ,,oy, as busy as they are now, ** t@rm of trying to meet/constituents and keepw*g engagements^-***.  It&#x27;s hard to get hold of a U. S. Senator.  I think Bill will agree with me/x i_t&#x27; s hard to get hold of them for ten minutes, so you have to be nbla to bo piofc*y concise and give tfram your opinion and your advice as quickly as you can. BB:  As an employer, was he very demanding of you? *Hfuu3UJL A*~ &amp;or**&gt; f+6*/  eu * A+*&quot; s NB:  I think Senator Jordan#wao juct right.  I think/(he had the proper balanced-he na4 an excellent sense of humor; he was willing^to listen to tb* arguments on both sides of an issue.  I never really saw him upset with anyone personally.  He was a very comfortable person to be around and to work with I-found.  Very congenial. BB:  Did he ever raise his voice? NB:  Not that I&#x27;m aware of. BB:  What were his strong points? NB:  I think 1Jrt Senator Jordan was an excellent representative for his time and for his state.  I think he was a person who had learned a lot in life as he went along.  Ithink he learned from all of his experiences, and I think that by the time he got to be a U. S. /enator, I think he understood the state? T .think hn nndnrntnoti the people %. I think he had Nancy L. Bradshaw                                   3- a rea4 good grasp of what North Carolina was all about, and f-1 Hi ink he represented the state very well. BB:  What were his weaknesses? NB:     Well, [Innphr]   iaduii1 L  luall^   farm   LhaL liu had aiiji   wualuiLjJn   !  iri I would just say that he did his job well. BB NB BB NB Did he work hard? Yes^ I think he did*-&gt;Ithink he enjoyed being a United States Senator, Why do you say that? AI tk-ink it was reflected in his attitude, and juct boing around-^m the office  he was always very positive) always very cordial--^&quot;( **a, Bill Cochrane:  --he was completely absorbed in it; he was interested in it; he was an excellent delegator to all of us, but at the same time, if anybody took a problem to him, whether it be a rural carrier&#x27;s problem, which Nancy handled for a long time, whether it was a social security case; whether it was a lowly person or a high person--the Senator would show that he was really humanly, genuinely interested in what your problem was. And he showed a disposition to want to help--whatever it was; whether it was a rules committee problem, whether it was a point involving the rules of the Senate, whether it was a point involving one of the legislative matters we had jurisdiction over, or one of the other committees; he would take interestshow more interest than most big shots do.  He really did and he was genuinely interested in other human beings. see BB:  Bill you had a chance to/Kerr Scott in action, and also Everett Jordan.  How would you contrast those two?    [Phone rings] BB:  Nancy, when did you come to Washington? NB:  1 mum LU&#x27; HlJ^hm^fcuu in June, 1961.  June 19* was the day I started to work.  That&#x27;s a day I&#x27;ll always remember.

BB:  Is Bradshaw your married name? f^^f NB:        NO,     I&#x27;m    Single**   n    GM#m&amp;    Cl^rl     T    griP^    ynn&lt;r\    rny p^&quot;   . ^&#x27;-------------I                                    ------------------&#x27;---------------------1----------------------------------.----------------------------------------------&#x27;----------- . r&amp;f&quot;&quot;^          c .... that &amp; one   roacon   I   feel  ho  did-hiejob  wall ,   hprauiro  ho sti&#x27;O&#x27;h  a  giJS&#x27;p&#x27; uf human nature,     He  understood people;   he  was   compassionate; he  was  concerned;   he  gave  everything  a personal   touch.

It was a good feeling &#x27;akettt *** **-**r  why we were there and what we were doing.  I enjoyed it.  Of course^things ^hangeas you move along. Bill Cochrane:  Back to your question about Scott and Jordan--they were very similarwithout regard to labels--! think they reacted about the same way to particular proposals they had to vote on up here.  Their personalities were different in some ways.  They worked closely together when Senator Scott was running for Governor--we need to go into that a little more deeply--! don&#x27;t believe that needs to be a part of this conversation.  I don&#x27;t want to treat that lightly--that&#x27;s an important thing.  But comparisons A-Rl OollDKS, that&#x27;s an old saying.  I wouldn&#x27;t vaf&amp;gate be able to say anything about either one of them which would denigrate the other--as a contrast. BB:  Nancy, can you tell me how Senator Jordan approached a problem? NB:  I- th-inJt he listened to what was being said* an* I think that&#x27;s a real key quality in a member of Congress*- &#x27;fo  listen to what an issue is all about. . ) Nancy Bradshaw                                         -5- also BB:  Was he the kind of person who/knew who to go see if he had an area he was not particularly clear on?  Did he know where to go? NB:  I don&#x27;t think he would hesitate to talk to his colleagues or ask their opinion  J think ho-w&amp;f open.  He listened; he was concerned; he was a compassionate p@rs&lt;m\   a*W he was open to suggestions. stinted on rnnnrrmm Bill Cochrane:  He never stood on ceremony, NB BB NB BB NB BB No,he didn&#x27;t! So he was not devious or evasive-- No.  No. Direct and practical? Yes. Then he handled his job here in Washington about like he handled his through job back in Saxapahaw.  So the man didn&#x27;t change--he carried on/here. NB:  I would assume so.  When? I know him lie mm   lite camo porcen hm hod ai BB:  Some people, if they have a title, you know it.  How about Senator J. NB:  I think he liked and enjoyed the power that went with being a United States ^enator.*^I&quot; &quot;llll&#x27;irk any one of us would.  But I don&#x27;t think that the fact that he had/)the job detracted from him as a person.  He still carried with him his basic qualities ^ikable, wonderful sense of humor. BB:  Did you detect any changes in his political philosophy while he was here? From the time you first met him until he left, did you see any basic changes? NB:  Bill, T&#x27;m n-t fiitn wwwa *&quot;&quot; (W s#W +^+- gyp^f-inn  j/nniH this be the time to mention about the Viet Nam vote? BB:  That&#x27;s been discussed, but one thing that we didn&#x27;t go into--who influenced that decision? Are you aware of who was involved in that process? NB:  I&quot; tfrinfe many of us on the staff were.  Ac I raiiiill Uiut.^was a period of time when we had anijoutpouring of public sentiment on the issue such as I don&#x27;t recall seeing at any other time while I was in Washington.  I don&#x27;t e**r remember seeing/,tne numbers of people who came constantly- the mail--all of that is bound to have had an influence. BB:  He got a lot of mail on this issue? NB:  Oh/yes!  In fact/I think every member of Congress was getting^mail. This was as we moved into, T Wa&amp;k, the late&#x27;60s,  T tliinli In 1 i h mm J, np.1 t ht.-.-^ir k, --- rrri ,, j |  , I, il,, rnnliiiQ- +^-+ mmm  Warng *pi.....,l a t Bill Cochrane:  Well now who expressed feelings to him? m*--[laugh*] BC:  Did you ever express your feelings to him on that subject? NB:  As I recall, I probably would not have discouraged him from--- BC:  Ann Buchannan and Nancy Bradshaw picked on me all the time about that war. NB:  Welly Ben, it was an extraordinary time*.don&#x27;t you think.Bill? BC:  Why don&#x27;t you tell Ben what you really think!!! [tape runs out] Jordan BB:  0. K. Bill, you and Nancy, tell me who influenced Senator/to become a dove instead of a hawk in the Viet Nam War. NB:  [laughs]  Well^can I say that I think thn-t Bill was the primary *$lut&lt;*&lt;*&quot; parson,  I had the benefit of sitting in Bill&#x27;s office during this period of time when we were visited by numbers and numbeiu of people who were ya&amp;t so agitated over the war, and * had the extraordinary privilege of listening to -Bill talk to these people who would come in, extremely upsetj determined in their point of viewj and who would leave thinking there might be another side to the issue.  So,I&#x27;m aware of Bill&#x27;s extraordinary powers of persuasion, I would say that I -think he would have been the ultimate influence in advising the Senator about these things. Nancy Bradshaw                                        -7- BB:  Did the staff try to influence Bill Cochrane? NB:  I don&#x27;t think the staff 4*a* ever hesitated to express its views to Bill.  I don&#x27;t know to what extent he was always swayed by that but we weren&#x27;t shyj we would speak up  We also felt free to express our opinions to Senator Jordan.  I always felt I could talk to him. BB:  But did you;  Did you express your convictions? NB:  Yes.  oj I did. BB:  On this particular issue?  What was his response? NB:  fr don&#x27;-t romember &quot;I&#x27;m sure I did^Ben,&quot; but ! think thnt Bill would really be the main spokesman.  Many times we&#x27;d express our views to Bill and he, in turn, would talk with the ^enator, BB:  Bill, I&#x27;d like to explore this further because I think it&#x27;s important. BC:  I think we&#x27;ll go into that when I find that tape that records the conversation that I had with Senator Jordan immediately prior to his casting his vote on the Cooper-Church Amendment.  It occurred right after I returned from two weeks in the Far East.

The Senator and Mrs. Jordan?-J&amp;m&amp;  Mfixe g r*?i j-^^ ?r)1j T&quot;Trn&quot;&#x27;    &#x27;    1    &quot;&quot;&quot;      HVWl    &#x27;   &#x27;&quot;......               Hi I I    T&#x27;.....urn    I ill ,1   In. i    LhuL. BB:  What do you mean &#x27;they were a team&#x27;? NB:  I think she supported him in his political life and I think she was as much a part of his efforts as he was) in a way.  I just can&#x27;t think of one without the other, BB:  Do you think she influenced his opinions or his actions? NB:  * dan1I know, but,I&#x27;m sure that Mrs. Jordan would express her opinion whenever she felt-- BC:  On a limited number of topics.  If she had a strong feeling about something--she was acquainted with it, but it normally wouldn&#x27;t involve legislation. simply NB:  .....&#x27; I think wtwrt all this is*-i*/the legislative process at work. You have a Senator with a staff who researches and W*iH&amp;    and advises, and a member who makes the final decision.  And I think all of this to various degrees is played out in oil ef these offices.  It&#x27;s colored,(pf course, by the personality of the member [the /enator].  That has a lot to do with it.  The personality of the member I think ean seta the tone for the office a-voga-n, and governs to a large extent the type of staff BB:  It is a heavy burden on the shoulders of the staff to do a good job of writing and researching is it not?  So then the quality of the Senator&#x27;s work depends upon the quality of his staff? NB:  I think you could say that) don&#x27;t you,Bill? BC:  Largely, I think.  It depends on the(poweTSof the Senator --if he hasn&#x27;t got that of course it&#x27;s pointless no matter how good a staff he&#x27;s Nancy Bradshaw                                     -9 got,  You can&#x27;t always &quot;parrot&quot; everything, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an important part of it  No Senator these days can do his work right unless he has a good staff, and the better his staff is the better off he is when he gets out there on the floor.  If the Senator is handling something on the floor, then his key staff person is sitting right beside him, unable to speak on the floor, but able to write a note and hand it to him which he can act on pretty fast,  Now Senator Jordan was a very good team player.  He could take his cue and pick it up and go with it.  As Chairman of the Rules Committee he had a handle on all the legislation on the floor that came out of the rules committee.  He was the chairman, that was his prerogative--to handle it.  He also had the rules committee experts sitting over there.  If it was legislative business, Nancy would advise him; I would be aware of all of it and would have talked to him on things.  Nancy, in the case of agriculture, would attend the committee meetings--and on and on and on.  Agrigulture was very important everywhere [NC] but particularly in the state/with more farmers and more farms than any state in the union regardless of population--more total numbers--not just percentage.  Over on public works--Senator Jordan was always very active with respect to water resources.  I normally handled those for him other people, as I say, helped out, but he was always active in that area and always appeared before the public works committee, of which he was a member, to get projects authorizedand before the public works appropriations sub-committee of the appropriations committee with the same objective, so they would be funded.  The staff person that would be working on it would deal with the Corps of Engineers and other experts  with the State of North Carolina and its water peoplesometimes the Governorwith respect to projects.  There was a great deal of interplay-state and federal, sometimes city-county-state and federal on all those Nancy Bradshaw                                       10- things.  I didn&#x27;t mean to get involved to this extent but your question is very hard to answer yes or no                         .............___.... tft\[}\anoy  laughs very loud and long] Do I have your permission to repeat that?  Can/I Bill?  [still laughing] BC:  Sure, if you want to. NB:  I said, if Bill were a Senator, he would not need a staff.  He could do it all himself.  [Bill laughs in background] To a king&#x27;s taste. BC:  Nobody could do that, but that&#x27;s awfully nice of you to say that. NB: .  n n ,   I miss/|h*m.  1^ think* he is the kind of person you mire.- I think 4Jwrt because you like and respect him,you miss him when he&#x27;s not around. I&#x27;?fil1^-sometimes,when I see his picture,it brings back all those memories of tha%* early days when I worked for him.  He gave me my first j &quot;K  T      &#x27; I &#x27; &#x27;   1 ;r T r 1 ..... .....&quot;inmrh-&#x27;   T   1  ii&#x27;i   r    l   .....iPmiilili   mmteg   Mmi   ......i  hi nliliji i 11. &quot; ahnut franctituontJ whu wuuld come to aee ua about iseuooi  Bill? BC:  We had the same thing everybody else had--people who were interested in the problems the farm groups the tourist groups tourism; the textile people; the furniture manufacturers--we heard from them all at one time or another when things would come up that they were particularly interested in.  The State of North Carolina was frequently interested in matters that came upwe had our share--various people would talk to them; depending on who was handling it.  The Senator would listen to anybody himself.  He did his share of that sort of thing.  That&#x27;s not bad.  you learn a lot from those people.  Those were the ones that would be affected by the legislation.  There was nothing different or unusual about that in our office except that he would not give somebody--for example:  If somebody wanted a federal contract they wrote him a letter and asked for Nancy Bransahw -11 a particular contract.  He would write them back and say that it had been his consistent practice not to interfere for, or against any person seeking a federal contract; or seeking to sell land to a federal post officewhatever.  Then he would say, &quot;However, as a courtesy to you I will be glad to forward your letter to the proper authority, asking them to send you whatever information that is available so you can have an equal chance with everybody else.&quot;  He would not interfere for, or against anybody who was trying to get a charter for a federally chartered bank or savings and loan.  Now this was not followed in every office this policy.  I think that was a pretty enlightened policyI think that Senator Ervin followed a similar policy.  But we did this the whole time that Senator Jordan was here.  For example:  When the Research Triangle was selected as the sitethe environmental health centerwith all the buildings that were to be built down there [phone rings] ............ NB:  Bill,don&#x27;t you fclAirit I eould fray that Senator Jordan was a good Democrat? And was loyal to the party? BC:  Oh there&#x27;s no questionhe was a total Democrat.  &quot;Yellow dog Democrat.&#x27; .....back to this thing I started to mention.  Largely through the efforts of Senator Jordan up here and Governor Sanford they selected the Research Triangle as the site for the Enviromental Health Center.  Lister Hill of Alabama, chairman of  the appropriations committee, had a hand in doing thatgood friend of Senator Jordan&#x27;s and Gov. Sanford had close ties with the Kennedy administration.  A big appropriation for the time  my mind suggests $70 million or something like that for buildings.  Immediately we began to have visits from some of the representatives of some of the biggest architectural firms in the world seeking help from Senator Jordan in gettinathat contract for their architectural firm.  I saw them all for him.  I told each one of them that the Senator did not interfere Nancy Bradshaw                                     -12- either in behalf of or against people--1 told them all that.  They couldn&#x27;t believe it!  They&#x27;d come back at me in different ways.  I remember one of them came back  one of the really big firms the guy that built the U. S. Embassy in New Delhi- Edgar Darryl Stonehis representativethey couldn&#x27;t believe that and they wanted to know if there wasn&#x27;t some firm in N. C. they could associate with for this special venture that Senator Jordan would recommend to them.  Well that would be how to get you involved in it.  Well he followed the policy that we had all along that he didn&#x27;t do that.  Now the N. C. architects learned thatit was not followed that way all over the country, and there wasn&#x27;t anything illegal about doing it, it just seemed to him to be a fairer way of doing business,  And once they all knew that somebody else wasn&#x27;t getting any special treatment from the Senator, why they thought it was fair enough.  We never got hurt because of that policy. BB:  Nancy, you specialized in Agriculture.  How would you  evaluate his job performance. NB:  I -would aay excellent.  I think he represented the state and its interests,r* I~ think the Senator had a very good working relationship with members of the Agriculture Committeeytoo, and E think that&#x27;s very important in getting legislation through. BC:  They respected him. NB:  Yes^they did, and Ithink that&#x27;o impwvtnnt,.  I thiak that made him more effective.  He had a good working relationship with his colleagues. BC:  One more thought Ben:  A lot of staff people down in the lower echelons don&#x27;t really get to know their Senators.  Senator Jordan&#x27;s office was off at one end of the Rules Committee suite-- I mean the suite they had given the Senator from North Carolina.  He quite frequently, almost every day, would enter the suite at the other end--at the far end, Nancy Bradshaw                                     -13- and walk through all the offices on the way to his office speaking to everybody on the way to his office.  tow he did that almost all the time unless he was in one heck of a hurry. NB:  He should have worn an &quot;I Love People&quot; button. BC:  I never saw anyone around here that was any more congenial in all his activities, including moving down the corridors, than Senator Jordan was.  He spoke to all of them.  White 5 black, rich  poor, young  old, fatS thin, important G lowly.  One word that they applied to him when he first came up here-- some newspaper headlinedon some little furorthe word they applied to him that described him best of all was &quot;unruffled&quot; I don&#x27;t remember the specific occasioneverybody gets annoyed now and then, but he concealed it better than most people, if he did get annoyed. Now that&#x27;s the literal truthTthat&#x27;s not just a matter of bias or prejudice or preference or anything of the sort.  That just plain out happens to be true. I&#x27;ll tell you one little story that I might not think of again and it dosn&#x27;t have anything to do with anything we have been talking about. Senator Jordan was born on September 8, 1896, Albert Coates, the founder of the Institute of Government in Chapel Hill, the University, was a law professor there for many years^ who mm  a Harvard classmate of Sam and Ervin&#x27;s in law school and a contempory/classmate and eventually one of the executors of the estate of Tom Wolfe.  Mr. Coates came to see me a lot--I was with him for years in the Institute of Government, and whenever he was up here he would come by.  And he got to know Senator Jordan--he was two weeks older than Senator Jordan.  They always had a good time chatting; and one time Mr. Coates came by to see me, late in the afternoon, and he waited around a while to say hello to the Senator and finally had to go to catch the plane.  Five minutes later Senator Nancy Bradshaw                                     -14- Jordan walked in. I gave him Mr. Coates message and told him that he was sorry he missed him. The Senator said, &quot;You know, I&#x27;m sorry too; I&#x27;ve become quite fond of the old gentleman.&quot;  Two weeks older. You&#x27;ve asked several of us if we detected any changes in his demeanor, etc. after he got up here.  I think over the 15 years he was here he mellowed somewhat.  His interests vastly broadened.  He had done a lot of civic and political work in North Carolina over the years.  He was interested in things other than building his own business, although he was very good at that I&#x27;m sure.  You would know about that,  I&#x27;m sure he had to participate in family coun&amp;fl)and so forth, but for the most part he turned loose of the daily operations, gradually over time,and he switched his interests up here to the subjects he was charged with knowing about and I think he grew in wisdom and grace through the years. I think his experience here, good man that he was when he came, made him a better man.  He certainly was a better rounded person.  His pMrviewf^) was pretty broadhe reached into all sorts of things.  I think he grew in the office--he magnified his office, and made_J/t_a _real service to the people of North Carolina by both his temperament and attitude and what was in his head and what he had learned.  But I think he did grow from the year he got here until fifteen years later.  He did grow, he did mellow and he did broaden his interests in the problems that the other fellow had.  This is a good place to do that and he took more advantage of it and expanded more, I think, than many people do. BB:  Was that,typical of the average Senator or was he an exception in that respect? BC:  No I think that is the general process that goes on, but there is degree, and many people are never able to overcome their orientations that they brought in.  I think he was always interested in the other Nancy Bradshaw                                            . \ 5 .. side of the question and in the other fellow&#x27;s problem.  I think the longer he stayed here the more he learned about the other side of the question and the other fellow&#x27;s problem.  He could see the other point of view. BB:  He examined both sides of the issue? BC:  Ye*.  And you don&#x27;t always have to do that when your are pushing your own interests you know--although I think he was doing that all along. NB:  May I say also that I think he was very luckyfcthat ho had Bill as his administrative assistant. BC:  He had an excellent staff put together--all but me NB:  Most Senators do not have that advantage, [TV news broadcast in background is telling about the person they believe to be Norman Mayer who is threatening to blow up the Washington Monument.  His  demands were that the question of Nuclear Disarmament rise to the top of the agenda until that matter is settled.  The emergency has been going on for nine hours.

<dcterms:abstract>Ellen Gerber grew up in Brooklyn, New York, during the 1930s and 1940s in what she describes as a &quot;typical middle class Jewish American&quot; family. Gerber explains that she was influenced by liberal politics and the expectation that she would have a career despite her gender. In the 1960s, Gerber received a doctorate in physical education and spent a number of years teaching in northern colleges and writing books about the history of physical education and women in sports. In 1972, following the passage of Title IX, she toured college campuses to speak about implementing this measure for women&#x27;s athletics. In so doing, she became increasingly convinced that legal change offered the most viable route for achieving gender equality, and in 1974 she enrolled in law school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Gerber describes what it was like to be an &quot;older&quot; woman in law school during the mid-1970s and talks about her goals to help women with her law degree. Following her graduation, Gerber was hired by Legal Aid, where she worked for fifteen years before retiring. She describes how her own role evolved in Legal Aid after she became the managing attorney in 1980, and she discusses the impact of federal budgeting on legal service for the poor in North Carolina under the administrations of Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush. In addition, Gerber speaks at length about women&#x27;s issues, ranging from her own motivations for advocating for women&#x27;s equality and her participation in such organizations as the North Carolina Association for Women Attorneys.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Good morning! It&#x27;s February 18th, 1992. I&#x27;m Kristen Gislason of the University of North Carolina School of Law, and I&#x27;ll be interviewing Ellen Gerber of High Point.  ELLEN W. GERBER: All right, it&#x27;s moving. It&#x27;s doing something.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, we have to start off with background information, so do you want to just take it from there, where you were born, what your parents did for a living, and siblings, family life.  ELLEN W. GERBER: I was born and brought up in New York City. My parents were both public school teachers, and I had a very conventional middle-class Jewish childhood. I think the only thing&#x27;s that&#x27;s remarkable in retrospect is that with both of my parents teaching, they both as Jewish families tend to do, helped in the housework. My father did his share, just as much as, again, Jewish men do. And so I grew up not even knowing what the proper role of women was in life. I grew up being expected to go to college, being expected to have a career, and this was, you know, I was born in &#x27;36 so, you know, that is remarkable.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: That is, that is. My parents aren&#x27;t that much, I mean they&#x27;re in your generation and I know my mom was not that encouraged to pursue a career, but I was expected to.  ELLEN W. GERBER: I was expected to. My mother worked, and of course it didn&#x27;t occur to anybody that that wasn&#x27;t just part of life. I went to college in Boston, Boston University, at this point it was called Sargent College which is the school of Physical Education, and I became a physical educator.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Were you involved in sports when you were in high school?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Some, some, yeah. I, ah, you know it was just a weird choice for me you know when I look back on it. My father wanted me to be a lawyer but at that time I didn&#x27;t want to be. And so I became, when I graduated from Sargent College I began teaching at the University of Pittsburgh, so my first job was at the college level.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Physical education?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Physical education at the college level. And I did that for about 17 years at various colleges and universities. Along the way I got a PhD, a masters in English and a PhD in …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: [unclear]   ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, yes, right, in sport, the history of sport and the philosophy of sport. And so I worked in that area for all those years. I had one break in that time and that is I went to Israel and lived in Israel. When I went I went with the possible intention of living there forever.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What year was this?  ELLEN W. GERBER: That was &#x27;60-&#x27;61. And that was, in those days and probably still today you could go down to the south of the country and see enemy territories to the south, to the north, to the east, literally see three enemies&#x27; countries from one spot in the desert.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What prompted you to go over there?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, it&#x27;s a search for your roots, you know. It was the Alex Haley story, but I was a Jew. It was like, why was it that my grandparents had bags of sand from the Holy Land that they were to be buried with, you know. Every year Jews recite a prayer that says next year in Jerusalem, [unclear]   KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you have any family in Israel?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I had turned out to have a cousin, one cousin. Most of my family, my extended family, was wiped out during the World War II concentration camps. There was one cousin who escaped and went to Israel.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What part of Europe was your family from?  ELLEN W. GERBER: My mother&#x27;s family came from Hungary and my father&#x27;s family came from what was Poland and then became Russia, and now is Poland again. So they were wiped out as well, except this one cousin. And another one, who had emigrated to the United States. So anyway, I went to Israel and I spent a year there and in the course of it I really came to conclude that I was an American. So I came home, continued on with my career, and stayed teaching physical education at the university level until 1972. In that time one of the things I was known for, I had written several books and articles, I was I guess you&#x27;d call it a scholar in the field. I was known for my advocacy for women. So I wrote a book, I wrote, co-authored the first text on the American woman in sports. I did the history section and concentrated in that area, made a lot of speeches about it, and I was responsible for on the 50th anniversary of Women&#x27;s Suffrage, getting a PE convention that was a woman&#x27;s college physical education convention, was meeting at that time to pass a resolution endorsing equality for women and things like that. So everyone in the field knew me. So when I retired, or left physical education in &#x27;72, I spent about a year and a half before I went to law school, running around the United States and even Canada by invitation, generally giving speeches urging women physical educators to pay attention to the rights of women athletes. In those days there wasn&#x27;t much in the way of women athletes in college in the sport.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: My grandmother competed internationally in track and field—  ELLEN W. GERBER: And when was that?  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: In the 30&#x27;s. She was married and my grandfather was a professional soccer player in Czechoslovakia. Unfortunately, their atheletic genes have not been passed down to me at all.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, that&#x27;s interesting. There was not much going on for women in those days. [laughter] After the 30&#x27;s the colleges just shut off athletics  for women on any real competitive level. They had intramural events, but, and at most for these school play days where you sort of went with other schools and mixed the teams.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: When did they start giving equal money to, you know athletes…  ELLEN W. GERBER: In 1972 Congress passed what was called Title IX, it was an amendment to the Higher Education Act. From &#x27;72 to &#x27;75 Title IX mandated sexual equality in the school systems, and of course that affected sports more than anything. From &#x27;72 to 75 they spent three years wrangling over what the regulations would be, but that department, well, in those days education was in HEW, Health Education and Welfare. And so they spent all that time wrangling, and I knew the woman who was working on that and that whole process, I followed it. When &#x27;75 came and the regulations were published and HEW started enforcing that, that is when they began to get equal money. Now, remember, I, from &#x27;72 to &#x27;73 and a half so to speak, was when I was running around, &#x27;74, that I was running around the country. Most of the women in the colleges teaching, who would be doing the coaching and running these sports programs, were opposed to this, to doing it. They were opposed because they had been brought up in an era that said this was no good. And they kept, their main theme song was this is like we don&#x27;t want to be like the men, we don&#x27;t want to have our sports programs to be these horribly distorted, overly competitive programs like the men.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you find that frustrating, that kind of attitude that you were going to cross, have to in turn battle women who were supposed to be…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, ah, I don&#x27;t think I found it frustrating. I found it, I thought of it more, I understood where they were coming from, but I felt they hadn&#x27;t thought it through carefully, and that&#x27;s sort of what I was doing. I would go to a university, they would invite me to make a speech, I would stay, spend two or three days there, I would often meet with a department, I&#x27;d have a newspaper interview, and I would try to urge them to see that first of all 90% of men&#x27;s sports were wonderful. I mean, you know, what they were picturing were these football teams or basketball teams that were just in the top ten schools, you know, that were just sort of grossly manipulated. But when you think about the cross country teams, and the tennis teams, and the track teams, and the lacrosse teams, and the even the basketball teams in some of the other kinds of schools, you realize that there was an awful lot of very good sports programs going on for the men. And the women had by refusing to have top level sports hadn&#x27;t set any role models, hadn&#x27;t set anything to aim for, and so they had a very, very, very small percentage of women competing in sports. Anyway, in the course of running around and doing all this, I was, again we&#x27;re talking about in the early &#x27;70s, it came, and you had to think about the Civil Rights movement and its activities at that time, it, it really became apparent that all the action was in the courts. You know, and I realized that I could make 100 speeches that wouldn&#x27;t do what one good legal case could do.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: And then I knew there was a story behind there.  ELLEN W. GERBER: And so I, so largely because of my interest in the rights of women, which was very strongly a part of my philosophy and way of thinking, and for some other personal reasons, I decided I would go to law school. And so I left physical education and I was on a leave of absence during that time I was doing that speaking, and I left physical education and I started law school at …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: And your father was happy.  ELLEN W. GERBER: My father was happy, yes, my father was very happy. So I started in the fall of &#x27;74.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How did you choose Carolina?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, during all this period starting in 1966 I was living with a friend and sharing her home; and she took a time at UNC-G in &#x27;71, and so we moved our home down here.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you find it difficult going to law school as a, I imagine you were probably not the only older woman in your class, but …  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, in my class we were approaching 25%, and I certainly was an older woman.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, you&#x27;re certainly not old.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, that&#x27;s fair. At that time I was only in my mid-30s I guess.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Which is not old, but I think, somebody, I actually believe 24 is the average student.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, I wasn&#x27;t the oldest person in my class; there were a few older people, but yes, but, yes I was amongst the oldest. And no, I did not feel strange doing that. For two reasons. First of all, I liked school. Remember I was an academician so it wasn&#x27;t as if I had to worry about, &quot;Gee, how am I going to succeed? You know, it&#x27;s been so many years, is my mind too rusty?&quot; and all of that. I didn&#x27;t have any of those worries. As a matter of fact, it was completely the reverse. It was such a pleasure to take the time to study and read. You know, I used to say during exam periods … my friend, who is still teaching at UNC-G, she spends that time period grading papers, and grading papers is the most miserable experience you can have. You see totally what a failure you are.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: [laughter]   ELLEN W. GERBER: You&#x27;re right … and what they write is such dribble, and so wrong, and you see yourself misquoted and misunderstood, and so that&#x27;s a depressing experience. And I used to say, gee you&#x27;re sitting there, you know, I&#x27;d much rather spend an exam week thinking through, organizing my thoughts, outlining my course materials, learning, you know in order to take exams, than to be grading them and at the end all you have is depression and a bunch of letters that you&#x27;ve given out that everybody&#x27;s going to be unhappy with, you know. So I sort of like that freedom to go to school. And I also liked getting up if I was down or tired, so what, I&#x27;m going to sit in the class. As opposed to when you are teaching you have to get up for that class somehow. So it was much easier for me in many ways. I commuted between the law school and Jamestown where I was living at the time. It was a long commute but I didn&#x27;t have to worry. Basically I maintained a social life at home and it wasn&#x27;t like, gee, how am I going to make friends with these 22-year-olds? But I had a good circle of friends in the law school.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you have a definite goal in mind with Legal Aid, did you know exactly what you wanted to do?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No. Actually I wanted to open what I had in mind as a southern women&#x27;s law center, and I was going to emphasize women&#x27;s law. I had this whole vision of it. That changed for a couple of reasons. One of which is, I think every law student must go through this; you suddenly realize there&#x27;s no way in the world you know how to practice law. And you know you&#x27;re coming out of law school and you&#x27;re totally incompetent. And that was even worse for me. That was probably one of the biggest negatives of going back to school and having a second career. You have a certain standard of competence that you expect of yourself; you know you see yourself as a knowledgeable person who knows what to do about things, and suddenly you&#x27;re an utter idiot and you can&#x27;t find your way to the court house. You go to the court house to file a complaint and you realize you need two checks, not one check; one for the sheriff and one for the file. And you know, you have a bunch of papers you&#x27;re carrying with you and you don&#x27;t know where to take them, you don&#x27;t know which ones to leave with the clerk and which ones to take back. You know it&#x27;s one of those sort of stupid little things. But those kinds of trivial things bother me, and so I, I, you know, I tell new students as they come out now because I&#x27;ve had a lot of dealings with law students over the years in the clinic programs; you will not feel competent for at least two to three years, so don&#x27;t worry about it. You know, you have to accept it, you&#x27;re not going to. And so that&#x27;s easier for a 24-year-old who has never had a job. It&#x27;s much harder for an older person who really hates feeling stupid.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Were you involved in the clinic program at Carolina?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I was involved in helping to get a clinic program —  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Oh, I see.  ELLEN W. GERBER: I was amongst the group of rebellious students that fought very hard to have one. We never had one when I was there, but we were certainly in the midst of that fight and in fact we ran into a lot of trouble with some of the faculty who were very opposed to one.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Why were they opposed?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, they just didn&#x27;t believe; the major reason was they didn&#x27;t believe in a clinical program. Now you have to understand this was before Dean Broun, this was when Dean Byrd, and he was not in favor of it. And there was in those days a faculty alliance between Dean Byrd and Dan Dobbs, who was a fine torts professor and remedies professor and had been around a while, very intelligent.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: He wrote the textbook.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Also wrote the textbook and was a very intelligent man and very close to Dean Byrd because he too taught torts, and they were very close. And they just were opposed. On the, again on the grounds law school was the place where you learned and studied the scholarly aspects of the law. And not learned the practitioners&#x27; way of doing  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Getting back to the competency — it seems just like clinic would be the most obvious way to get that experience.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Ahm, yes, it should have been. But they were worried. They had Duke in mind. And they were worried, that was the model of a law school. Oddly enough Duke had a clinic thing. But they were not the kind of clinic I&#x27;m talking about, they had a different sort, but they, they were looking to make a law school second to none intellectually. And they, to them the clinical part, and to them, to everybody, to this day clinical programs are the stepchild of a law school. I mean, you know, you&#x27;re probably not aware of this because it wouldn&#x27;t concern you, but you know most clinical faculty are not tenure track faculty. They&#x27;re treated like second-rate faculty. And I recognize this because that&#x27;s how physical educators are looked at by the university. Clinical experience is the practical side; that&#x27;s not the real life of the university. And so that&#x27;s where the opposition lies, and I understood that very well having come through the route I came. But so we lobbied to have students on this faculty curriculum and that was a second point of contention. People like Dan Dobbs did not appreciate having to sit down and negotiate with students over curriculum decisions; he thought those were faculty decisions to be made. Very traditional view that was out of step at the time. And you know, again we talking back in the mid-70s and the revolution in education comes slowly, and he just wasn&#x27;t … he left, he left, and they always said he left because of our little group that fought for these …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: He left while you were there?  ELLEN W. GERBER: He left when I graduated, that year I graduated, and never came back.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What do you think helped bring it about?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I left, I graduated in &#x27;77 and I think it was formed in either &#x27;78 or &#x27;79. The change in the law school, Ken Broun became the dean sometime about then and he was a big clinic supporter, and that was probably what brought on the whole change.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What other classes did you, or what things did you enjoy to  ELLEN W. GERBER: I did take trial advocacy, yes. That was one of the first years that they had it and that was excellent; it was really a wonderful course. And I had Ken Broun for evidence. And that was just a treat, really a treat. Unfortunately Dan Pollitt was on leave my second year, which is the year you get to have him if you&#x27;re going to have him for a course on labor and common law, and so I got to my third year and I had already had those courses, and I had no way to have a class with him, and so then I asked him if I could do an independent study with him, because I knew he was the one professor in the law school I really would like to know. And he at that time had come back and he was getting all these requests from prisoners for some assistance. And he said what you can do is, you can answer these prisoner requests and that will be your independent study. You&#x27;ve got these letters and you can answer these requests, and another woman who was coming in at that time was Margot Freeman, and she was a year behind me, she started to do that as well and there was another student who came along and wanted to work with us, and there were three or four of us doing it. Margot then organized that into the prisoners&#x27; rights project, and so that flourished and continues to flourish to this day. And so that was the inception of that too; Dan getting somebody to deal with his things. That was a large part of my law school. The other thing was, Susan Lewis; do you know her? She came to the law school as a faculty member the same year I started. She had graduated from the University of Texas two or three years earlier, and she taught contracts and family law, because of course you had to give the woman the family law course when there weren&#x27;t very many on the faculty at the time. And I was her research assistant my second year when I did a research scholarship or something. So I wrote memos on family law for the next couple years. And that was helpful to me in learning that area of the law. And I had thought that&#x27;s what I wanted to do because I was so interested in women and those issues; but when I came out and started to practice I realized what a miserable area of the law that is.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: We&#x27;ve already found that out.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, there are no winners, there are sort of only losers. You know, if you have a couple and they&#x27;re living together and they have children and they&#x27;re going to divorce, by definition they&#x27;re going to be worse off economically. Your children are going to be worse off, separated — I mean emotionally they may feel happy because they have finally separated from each other and they don&#x27;t want to be there, but basically …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: It&#x27;s not a positive experience.  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s not a positive experience in any way, and even if the guy is a drunk and violent bum, you recognize that probably he&#x27;s got a disease, an alcoholic or compulsive addiction of some sort, and he really can&#x27;t help himself all that well, and the best you&#x27;re doing is, you know, making it right for your client as best you can, but to me there was no satisfactions in that. It was just miserable situations dealing with those things. Whereas the area that I got really interested in, in consumer law, consumer law, the consumers wear the white hats and creditors wear the black hats and everything is clear and no matter what, no matter what you always know where right is and wrong is, and you can fight for your client with 100% sense of doing justice.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Was there a consumer law class at the time?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: That&#x27;s one of those classes of the 90s.  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s one of those classes of the 90s. I didn&#x27;t even know you had one. Yeah, consumer law was always a stepchild. You have to understand that law schools go by what the Bar tests, and that was even more so in the 70s.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you feel obligated to take, I found myself last semester taking a lot of classes that were on the Bar, and …  ELLEN W. GERBER: Sure, you have to take the Bar courses. I waited till my third year to take most of those for what I thought was a smart reason, that if I was taking them so I could pass the Bar, I should take them as close to the Bar as possible, and so I took most of those courses in the third year and passed. As it turns out, the UCC course that we had, which was the hardest and most miserable course in law school, turned out to be the most valuable one. And the one professor I have ever called at the law school for assistance, and I still do to this day, is Don Clifford, because the UCC informs all of consumer law and when you take it you say I&#x27;m not interested in this at all because who cares about commercial law, who cares about how these widgets are sold and not sold, and whether the bills of lading are whatever, and you know whatever is in the UCC, and so it&#x27;s hard to understand to begin with but you&#x27;re totally uninterested in it because you think you&#x27;re never going to work in this area. Then it turns out that&#x27;s the heart of consumerism - the UCC. You know, it governs all transactions and so it&#x27;s a very, very important area.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What did you do in the summertimes between those school years; did you do research?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No, I was very fortunate that because I did have a reputation in physical education, I was invited each summer to teach at various campuses. So one summer I taught at the University of Texas at Austin, and one summer at the University of Houston, and some of these were concurrent, like I would do two places in one summer. I taught at the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, and up in Strasbourg, PA. So I did that and I was able to earn enough money to fund my way through law school. Because even though tuition was next to nothing at Chapel Hill, I still had to pay my share of living expenses, so I was very fortunate. So I did that, I therefore had just about no practical experience; I mean I had hardly been inside a law office when I graduated. That did not add to my confidence.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: So when graduation rolled around did you have a legal …  ELLEN W. GERBER: A job? [laughter] I had no …   KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Those are questions people are asking now with the recession and everything.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right. No, I actually didn&#x27;t have a job when graduation rolled around. I had a job interview the day after graduation, which was the job I got eventually. But I did not have a job.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: The legal aid position?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yes, I had applied for that in December; well, in December they had posted it, and it was, oh gosh. It was April probably before they even got around to it. What they did was send someone to the law school who interviewed 20 people or whatever, went around to two or three law schools, and I was invited for an interview at the office. I was one of two or three people that were invited to interview. And that interview was the one that was a day up after commencement. So, fortunately it was the only job I interviewed for that I wanted. I mean that was probably the one year of my life that I was in a real depressed state.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you do the big firm interviewing?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I did the big firm interviewing on campus. It was clear to me that they didn&#x27;t want me, and I didn&#x27;t want them. Now one of the reasons they didn&#x27;t want me, was because in those days those firms still were not hiring women very much. If they had one woman, they thought they had done their duty. They had no blacks and one woman per large firm. And the one woman they would hire would be young and cute, not an old lady who was a former physical educator and who boldly proclaimed on her resumé women in law, women&#x27;s rights, and so forth. And I must have had enough  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Spelled trouble to them -  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, spelled trouble to them and at every interview virtually they would say things like, &quot;Well, now, some of our clients we represent are employers. Suppose some women sued these employers, our clients, on a Title VII law suit? Could you represent the employer?&quot; And I would say, &quot;Of course I could; if they were my client I would do what I had to do.&quot; And this went on for months it seemed like, and finally I said to myself, what am I doing? I didn&#x27;t go to law school to sell out my sisters. Why am I saying this? As if I want jobs with these firms that, where I&#x27;m going to wind up representing the employers in a Title VII suit. This is ridiculous. You know, so I sort of, you know, I was very depressed about the whole thing. I was wondering how am I going to get a job, how is this going to work out, you know I&#x27;ve gone through this big career turnabout and maybe it&#x27;s not going to work. And then, as I said, I got, I finally had this interview and it was probably not until April when they came to the law school and the director of the office, a senior attorney, and I knew, I was with him 20 minutes and by the time I walked out of that room I knew that&#x27;s the job I want; that&#x27;s the place I&#x27;ll feel comfortable.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you know anything about them?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Really, very little, practically nothing. Today I couldn&#x27;t have gotten it. We wouldn&#x27;t hire somebody like that. We would expect someone to have demonstrated commitment to the poor, but in those days, you know people weren&#x27;t so eager to work for legal services. And I, the pay was not very good; but anyway, I just knew this was the kind of work for me, and I was right. So, fortunately, so what I did is then after that short little interview, I used all the skill and knowledge that I had about how employment works because you remember I had had plenty of experience on the other end of it and I knew about things like that. And I did everything that would have pleased me to get that job, you know, writing, sending things. That&#x27;s one of the famous, I was telling Dan Pollitt about this interview and how I wanted that job, and he said, &quot;Oh, I know Thorns&quot; (Craig, that was the director of the office), and he said, &quot;Here, I&#x27;ll write him.&quot; He took a piece of paper out and he wrote: &quot;Thorns, hire the bearer of this note. Dan Pollitt.&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: That&#x27;s a Pollitt maneuver. [laughter]   ELLEN W. GERBER: Isn&#x27;t that a Pollitt maneuver? [laughter] I took that piece of paper with me to that interview, and I gave  it to Thorns, and I later learned that was the thing, you know, everyone respected Dan Pollitt so much. And the fact that the next year Margot Freeman, the one who had organized the clinic, she brought a similar note and it got to be, who&#x27;s getting this year&#x27;s bearer-of-the-note award? So for several years, we had the bearer of the note. When we had openings, we called Dan and said &quot;Dan, who you gonna give the note to this year, Dan?&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: So were you offered the position right after the graduation?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No, no, and what happened is I had the interview and then I, then after that I went up north to Ithaca and along the way I taught at Ithaca College and there was a conference, a physical education conference up there, and my friend that I was living with, that I am living in, was in, is still in physical education. So she wanted to go and I wanted to go to Ithaca. So we went up to Ithaca and while I was up there I made a phone call and found that Thorns had called my family in New York looking for me to offer me the job. And I called right away and said I accept. Came back, studied for the Bar, and started working.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you take the Bar that summer?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Took the Bar that summer.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: So when did you begin work?  ELLEN W. GERBER: In August. End of August, middle of August.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Was it overwhelming at first, I mean since you did not have that much practical legal experience?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Oh, terrible. Just terrible. As I said, you know, you feel so incompetent. So unable to deal with whatever it is. I knew nothing. I mean it was just amazing. I mean because you study for the Bar, and you take the Bar review course, and that doesn&#x27;t teach you anything, and I didn&#x27;t take the practical skills course. As you know in the big firms they pay for those; that course is very expensive. I now teach the practical skills course and have for the last several years. But at the time, you know, I hadn&#x27;t taken it, so I knew nothing. But my colleagues at Legal Aid were wonderful and they understood that. They had gone through it themselves and they were very helpful.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What about the other people that were hired in your class? I mean the other attorneys that were hired at the same time; had they had it?  ELLEN W. GERBER: In my office?  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Right.  ELLEN W. GERBER: I was the last. There was one other that started work the same time I did. And he, as it turns out, was a Brooklyn boy, another Jew who had gone to Rutgers. And he had had a career in city planning, a masters in city planning and a career in city planning and again was a little older. We became like brother and sister. In fact, he came to my retirement party. He now lives and practices in Atlanta. He came. He walked down the steps and I said, &quot;My God, Ben.&quot; And he said, &quot;I started with you and I&#x27;m gonna see to it that I&#x27;m here at the finish.&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Oh, how long had it been since you&#x27;d seen him?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I see him from time to time, you know.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Sounds like a nice surprise.  ELLEN W. GERBER: it was a nice surprise, you know. But, anyway, so he and I started together with the same lack of experience, but he was a very bright guy. We stumbled through things together. That helped to have somebody else who was sort of similarly situated.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What kinds of assignments were you given, I mean initially, the first few months there?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, the way our office worked, you sat down and, about every two weeks, and did what we called intake, and it still works that way. And they interview clients on a first-come first-served basis, maybe you would see 17-20 people in a day. And then with the help of the group you make some sort of group decisions and some individual decisions. You might take five to six cases out of that. And they will be your cases. So whatever the areas were that we covered, if you took the case it was yours. Now in the first couple of intakes that I did, someone sat with me and assisted me. After that I was on my own. And you know you could get help by going around the office and saying, can you help me on this, can you show me how to do this? For example, we had a man in the office who had graduated Carolina a couple years before me; his name was Jim Gulick, and he is now the Assistant Attorney General who heads the Consumer Affairs division, and he knew a lot about consumer law even then, and you know, I would go to him about consumer cases, go to somebody else about some other kind of cases. So I got help in doing them. And in that first intake, the first case that came in the door was a juvenile driving, some kind of driving problem case. And I tried that little trial to a judge, and in fact the last day I was in the office, the mother of that boy was in the waiting room. And she said, &quot;Ms. Gerber, don&#x27;t you remember me? I&#x27;m so-and-so&#x27;s mother.&quot; And that was really weird.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Right before, last day before you retired, oh.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Last day, that&#x27;s right. And that was almost 15 years later. And the second case I had that day turned out to be my first jury trial. So I had a jury trial the next summer, within one year of working, and that was my first jury trial. It was pretty exciting to do those things.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did you get a real high off going - I mean, I know you&#x27;re a very well respected trial attorney. I mean, what was it about that trial that…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Oh, jury trials are the cream, is the cherry, the cream and everything else.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: That scares me to death!  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, you know, it is scary. And it&#x27;s not for everybody. I mean if you don&#x27;t like to think on your feet and if you don&#x27;t like to, if you&#x27;re not liking to be confrontational, then there are other aspects of the law that are fine. You can be a negotiator; you know you can negotiate, you can do a lot of things that don&#x27;t require this confrontation. But trying a jury trial is performing. And the first time I got up and started to voir dire the jury and and I was scared, I mean I was dying. I lost about eight pounds. You have to understand, I mean it wasn&#x27;t like it was duck soup for me. I got up and I asked the jurors a question, and I remember the question: &quot;Have you ever served on a jury before?&quot; And this one guy raises his hand, and he must have been about 75 years old, and you are taught the follow-up question is &quot;What kind of case was it, civil or criminal?&quot; You know, you&#x27;re trying to find out if they went for the plaintiff or not, because if you&#x27;re representing the plaintiff you certainly don&#x27;t want people who served on a jury recently and who have found for the defendant, right? So I looked at him and he said, I asked him that question, and he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember; it was so long ago.&quot; And a quip came to my mind, because like I say he was so old I forget what the quip was that came to my mind. And I thought, can I say this, can I do this? And then I made a crack about his age, and everyone laughed, and then I realized it was OK. I knew that you could do that. You could be yourself. And I was frightened. As much as anything I was frightened. How can a New York Jewish Yankee stand, come down here and stand in front of a jury, and, and win them over and connect with them? And I won that jury trial, and it was not an easy case, and I won it. Oh, by the way, I wore then and I still do to this day, pants. I&#x27;ve always worn pants in court, every place. I have not worn a skirt but once in 20 years. And so there I was, not only the New York Yankee Jew but I was in pants, in 1977; 78 was this jury trial. And it worked. And I won. And then I knew I could be myself and do, and that that was part, that would be part of my success in being a lawyer. I didn&#x27;t have to be somebody else. And so that was wonderful, and that was very, very freeing. And after that, juries, like I say, they&#x27;re like performing, they&#x27;re like teaching. You know, you work, you&#x27;re literally teaching the jury. You&#x27;re teaching them about the case, about the law, and I&#x27;ve developed a style and taught it to the people in my office, of being a teacher. And so, in our voir dires, for instance, you always do a voir dire that&#x27;s aimed more at teaching the juries about the law and about the case than it is at weeding out people. Because, weeding out, you can&#x27;t do a whole lot. I mean you&#x27;re not talking about million dollar cases where you have jury panels and experts.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How much latitude are you usually given with a potential jury?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Depends on the judge. But what I&#x27;ve been saying to trial ad groups, if you don&#x27;t get objections, you haven&#x27;t asked enough questions, you know. There&#x27;s no reason not to go right up, tiptoe up to the line and if you get stepped on, you get stepped on. If you don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think you should ever knowingly ask a question you know is offensive. In my view, as long as you&#x27;re not asking questions that say to the jurors, what would you do in this situation, then you haven&#x27;t crossed over that line. And so, what I think you should do and what we always do, we always ask jurors - for example, if you&#x27;re trying a landlord-tenant case - &quot;Did you know that under North Carolina law, as the judge will instruct you, a landlord is required to make all the repairs that are necessary to keep the place habitable. Does everybody know that? Is there anybody here who thought that it&#x27;s a tenant&#x27;s responsibility to fix a leak, or mow the lawn, or do something? Huh?&quot; So then, usually, someone thinks that. And that&#x27;s the kind of thing you can educate them about. I had a jury trial once where the real estate agent would go to the courthouse, look up people who were in foreclosure, write them a letter and say, I can help you. And then do something that I now know is an equitable mortgage; say I&#x27;ll get you a loan, process papers where the house is actually deeded over to the investor and then you supposedly pay the investor back over about 18 months, and then the house is supposed to be deeded back over to you. There is an actual transfer of the property, but the law would regard that as a mortgage. Anyway, I did a voir dire on such a situation, &quot;Did you any of you know that someone could do this? That someone could go to the courthouse and look through the records, find out that you&#x27;re in trouble and contact you? In other words, your personal business is in this courthouse?&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I didn&#x27;t know that.  ELLEN W. GERBER: &quot;And it&#x27;s available to the public. Anybody could walk off the street and find out this stuff. Did you know that? Did you know that?&quot; And you know by the time you&#x27;re finished educating them about how, you know, you&#x27;ve got them. You&#x27;ve taught them something. People are very fond of people who teach them something. Jurors respond to learning. They want to. They&#x27;re interested in the experience. And so if you teach them, reach them in that way, you really can connect with them. So I found all that very thrilling and it built on my prior career.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Were there any particular cases that come to mind that were very, very frustrating, or that you were lost, or you felt that you weren&#x27;t able to hit the nail on the head, or connect, or whatever, that still to this day just stick in your mind?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, well, the most frustrating loss I had was at the Court of Appeals. And to this day, that just bugs the heck out of me. I feel that I somehow missed the boat although it was, I, it was also I thought politically a problem. There is a law called the Consumer Finance Act in North Carolina. And it allows creditors to charge enormously high interest, as much as 36%; Sherlock would have been jailed for that; but 36%. The idea of that act was to allow people who were very risky credit, not creditworthy at all, to borrow money. And so there were high penalties on the creditor if they didn&#x27;t get a loan and very strict regulations within the statute, but it did allow this high interest rate. Well, at some point along the way, they put a section in that act called Motor Vehicle Lenders, and they put a maximum interest rate of 16% on motor vehicle lenders within this act. And to me, and to this day I still believe, the act requires that if you take collateral in a motor vehicle as the statute points out, you cannot charge more than 16% interest. And the reason for that is that that&#x27;s good collateral. So even if the person isn&#x27;t creditworthy, the creditor is well protected. But it doesn&#x27;t say it explicitly … the Court of Appeals, anyway, I took a case up to the Court of Appeals. We had won it a summary judgment at the trial level, and the motor vehicle industry really fought this, and the Court of Appeals eventually said a creditor lending under this motor vehicles section can only lend at 16%, but they could lend under a different section of the statute that allowed 36% interest, and there&#x27;s nothing in that other section which is a prior written section that says that if you lend under this section you can&#x27;t take motor vehicles as a collateral. So basically they said a creditor could choose to lend under this 36% section, take a motor vehicle for collateral …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Which they would all do …  ELLEN W. GERBER: Which they would all do then, so that was the end of Motor Vehicle Lenders. You know, it didn&#x27;t matter, you know, so I thought that was ridiculous interpretation, because that rendered nugatory that Motor Vehicle Lenders section, and the legislature couldn&#x27;t have put it in there for no purpose. And it was written afterward and they didn&#x27;t go back and amend the other one, and it just makes it evident, self-evident it seemed to me, that if you took motor vehicle out, it said so in the statute, you were limited by the 16%. But the Court of Appeals disagreed and the Supreme Court refused to take review, which is probably the next most frustrating aspect of the law. The Supreme Court does not review very many civil cases. And they can&#x27;t. I understand their case loads are so huge; but that means if the Court of Appeals rules wrongly, you don&#x27;t have another shot with a civil case of getting it overturned, because you can&#x27;t get review. So sometimes that has happened to us. But the most frustrating is this one case, it is called Riddle v. Barclays American, and it&#x27;s annotated in the statutes. And it&#x27;s a terrible case.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What about a bad client, or a good client?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, this equitable mortgage circumstance I was telling you about, I had one of those cases where I got my client back all the money, you know, back about $18,000 and that went all the way up to the Supreme Court. And in the process, we also had to pierce the corporate veil, and that issue was the issue the Supreme Court considered, that was in Glenn v. Wagner, and they came up with a decision that made us one of the most liberal states in piercing the corporate veil. It was a terrific decision on that issue. That was my case and it was kind of fun to have a Legal Aid case be the piercing the corporate veil case.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Would you say that most of your cases help individuals resolve their small problems, or were they usually more broad cases that affected…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well the cases …  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  ELLEN W. GERBER: Collectively I have in my office a number of cases in the area of landlord-tenant law. In 1977 the legislature passed the Residential Rental Agreement Act, Chapter 42, and that was the year, remember, I started practicing law. And so since then we have developed the law in that area, and of the, oh I don&#x27;t know, six or eight or so published opinions on Chapter 42, most of them, not all, but several of them come from our office. Some of them were my personal cases. Now that collectively we&#x27;ve established a good interpretation. The Court of Appeals has bought our arguments and we&#x27;ve put a great spin on that statute, and we&#x27;ve been, you know I feel as if I have made a real contribution in helping to have that statute become a very important and strong tool for the tenants. Prior to that time there was no warrant of habitability in this state. A case, also out of our office as it happens, had established that, you know the great Washington, DC case that everybody learns about in law school, Judge Skelly Wright&#x27;s case; you know that just wasn&#x27;t so in North Carolina. And so until the legislature enacted Chapter 42 there wasn&#x27;t any warrant of habitability. The rain could come in on the tenant&#x27;s goods in the middle of the house and the tenant had no right to require repair. And so, you know, I think that&#x27;s probably one of the biggest impact type thing we&#x27;ve done. The other statute that was passed then in 1977 was the unfair debt collection act statute. We, again, we had a number of cases, not so much at the Court of Appeals level, although we&#x27;ve got one right now waiting for a decision, hasn&#x27;t been argued, but we&#x27;ve used that a lot in cases and managed to leverage very, very good negotiated settlements. And sometimes the trial court wins on using that statute which has now a $2000 statutory penalty. Those are, those are two areas that were, you know, virgin when I started practicing because the legislature had just passed the statute and we were able to really run with them and make consumer law and landlord tenant law enforceable in this state.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How did Legal Aid grow while you were, over the 15 years that you were…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Our office or as an institution?  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Both.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, let me start with our office. In 1980 I became the managing attorney. Now, at that time we hadn&#x27;t had one. We had somebody who was a litigation coordinator and he had not done that good of a job because of his personality; he left. And then nobody wanted any leader, any boss to supervise their case. Everybody was doing their cases, walking around and saying give me some help here or there to their colleagues, but there was no effective system for supervising.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did your colleagues come to you and appoint you, or did see a need and fill it?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, what happened is we had a fellow there who was going to take another job, and he was made the managing attorney briefly, sort of a half-time position. And he held it for about a half a year or so, and then he left anyway, a year maybe. And he was a black fellow and at that time we had a lot of racial tension in the office and he was wonderful at resolving that and getting us all together; again you&#x27;re talking about the end of the &#x27;70s and there were a lot of issues going on. And then so the office said, well we want to have a managing attorney; we like that, that worked well and we want to have one. And people urged me to apply. And we had an affirmative action plan that required the office to consider women or minority applicants internally, and if they took one, fine. If not, then they had to advertise the position, which meant that males or white males could not apply for the position internally. So I was urged by my colleagues to apply. My first instinct was no. I don&#x27;t want to, I don&#x27;t want to get it this way. If I get it I want to … and I really wasn&#x27;t ready for that. I had only been active eight years and I was still learning. But then I realized that that denigrated the notion of affirmative action, I mean, which I believed in. Then you&#x27;re saying that the people who get jobs under that aren&#x27;t worthy of them. So that didn&#x27;t square with my philosophy either, so I applied and I did get the job.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: As manager  ELLEN W. GERBER: As manager. And so at first my colleagues were people who were my colleagues. So it was a very soft approach. And as they left and I helped to hire people - our office hired people very democratically, and new attorneys would come in and I took on the role of supervisor. And within a few years I had developed a very strong supervision system in the office. And over the next decade I developed a system where I supervised every case. And I mean by that that every pleading that left that office had crossed my desk — I mean every pleading. That includes sometimes a 20-page; a 20-page package of discovery, interrogatories, request to admit, request to produce. It includes all briefs. It includes all complaints and answers, counterclaims, case strategizing. I worked on every case in that office; I supervised them. And I feel it was successful because after a while I never had to urge people to come to me. Even to this day I&#x27;ve retired and I went to the office and they said, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re here, could you sit down with me and strategize on this case?&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I see, so it&#x27;s like old times …  ELLEN W. GERBER: &quot;Could you look at this pleading that I&#x27;ve written?&quot; And people want that help; you need it. And as I was finally saying to sort of more senior people who might feel, hey I don&#x27;t need to have somebody looking over my pleadings, I am gonna submit everything I write to someone else. The only difference is I have to go find someone in the office who will look at them, whereas you have as a right somebody, and whom you&#x27;re not bothering. And so I became a full-time managing attorney although I maintained a caseload, a small caseload over the years, and continue to co-counsel, try cases and do things. For the most part my work was as managing attorney and I developed forms. We have form books that are unbelievable. For example, we have a discovery package. It&#x27;s divided into one section definitions; you know there might be 100 definitions in there, or whatever, because nowadays you have to put a lot in definitions because you can only ask a single question, because you&#x27;re limited to the number of questions you can ask. And on landlord-tenant law, for example, we have it divided into condition of the unit, the lease agreement, and other sections. There might be 20 questions under each section; maybe 200 landlord-tenant questions. So then when you&#x27;re doing a case and you want to do discovery, you pick up the dictaphone and say, give me question 2, 5, 9, 11; modify question 12 in the following way; here&#x27;s one that&#x27;s not even in there, add it. And you can do a whole thing in 15 minutes that comes out that&#x27;s 10 pages long, because we have every conceivable thing. What I had to do then was make sure that people didn&#x27;t go overboard, and so when I would review these things I would have to say, &quot;Why are you asking this question? That&#x27;s not an issue in this case.&quot; You know, I had to teach people that even if a question sounded good you still had to keep them focused on the case. But then I did the same thing with pleadings, just pages and paragraphs of pleadings. And you just have to pick&#x27;em. Pick the issues: I have facts, I have defenses, I have counterclaims, and each one has case and statutory citings, all divided by category, prayer for relief, the whole thing is in there. Now what that, what that does is first of all it sets a standard and allows people to trace things and do things at a pretty high and consistent level. Second, it reminds people of things they might have forgotten as they&#x27;re working on a pleading. They say, oh yeah, that&#x27;s an issue here I hadn&#x27;t even thought about that. It sort of jogs their memory. Third, as a supervisor it saved me a lot of time because I didn&#x27;t have to work on that rewriting, grammar, you know, awkwardness. And so when someone is creating something they don&#x27;t have to spend their time thinking about how to phrase it. And again, remember, Legal Aid often has new lawyers. You get a fair amount of turnover, although in our office less than a lot of places. But even experienced lawyers, they may not have worked on this kind of case or that kind of case. So by having these &quot;go by&#x27;s&quot;, it&#x27;s sort of taking these &quot;go by&#x27;s&quot; to a higher level and putting them altogether in some organized fashion. By everyone having this on their desk, they were practicing on a higher level and focusing on the substance rather than &quot;how do you do this, how do you say this?&quot; And it&#x27;s like, you know, it&#x27;s like computers in public schools; it frees the teacher, it doesn&#x27;t replace the teacher, it just frees the teacher to concentrate on what she needs to be concentrating on. And that&#x27;s what these form books do, and I developed them for the office. My God, they have three of them; by the time I left each one more monstrous than the next. But you know, our office grew. And that way we were able to focus on litigating. And everybody, I liked jury trial so then we would, everyone would get onto jury trials. And, that&#x27;s, in our office we kept hearing, all you care about is when we&#x27;re doing our first jury trials. Everybody&#x27;s scared to death of it, but it&#x27;s one of those things that one should do to see how much fun it is. And when we do do a jury trial, everybody comes down and watches and cheers you on and learns, and people say &quot;I wanted to see cause I&#x27;ve got one on the calendar next month, I want to see how you do that voir dire, see how you do that opening argument.&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What type of people when you are about to hire do you look for?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, first of all we look for people who have a dedicated and demonstrated commitment to the court and nowadays that means we look for people who have either worked in a clinic or did some things for the poor or worked for organizations, you know something that shows that you care, that you just don&#x27;t want this job because your girlfriend lives in Winston-Salem…  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Or it looks good on a resume.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right. Secondly, we look to people who are well recommended by people we know. I wouldn&#x27;t think of hiring someone who went to Carolina without talking to Dan Pollit, for example, and you now, Dan Pollit over the years has been very candid, you know about, this person is not for you, good person, lovely, not for you, not up to your standards. Walter Bennett, Alice Ratliff, those are people we know, and you know these are people we trust. And if they come here from the law schools in this state, its easy enough to find that, we&#x27;ve got a connection. We try to find to find people who has had some prior legal service and experience, during the summer or in a clinic situation or as a volunteer. You know if someone is applying from Wake Forest, for example, and we&#x27;ve never seen that person, never seen them, they never showed up, they never called our office to volunteer, we hire summer clerk, I am very skeptical. If you&#x27;re so dedicated to legal services, why didn&#x27;t we see you in three years? So we look for people who have shown a commitment either to the clinic or coming to us.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: You said that there is a high turnover rate, do you know what that is attributed to? Is it easy to burn out?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, in some offices that&#x27;s what it is, burn out, not our office, our office is real careful about that for the most part. I think the real reason there is a high turnover, there are two basic reasons. First of all, everybody who is coming, pretty much, is taking their first job, and people don&#x27;t stay in their first job forever. You know there is no reason to beat yourself over the head, you know about, why are we failing to hold on to these people. It&#x27;s natural to move on, and its particularly natural if their first job is a job that pays less than other jobs and that has no basic promotions because in most offices there is no place to go but doing more of the same. Now, over the years, since I became that managing attorney, other offices have had managing attorneys. They&#x27;ve seen that that&#x27;s a good system, around the country, so that&#x27;s a slot. But that leads to the institutional issue of growth or no growth. In 1977, when Jimmy Carter was, in the years leading up to Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency, legal services was in its heyday so to speak. I don&#x27;t know that you know this, but it became what it is today, the Legal Services Corporation Act, it was literally the last act signed into law by Richard Nixon of all people. It just shows you how far to the right the country has moved in some ways, because, in those days, even though Richard Nixon didn&#x27;t begin to match the conservatism of a Ronald Reagan or George Bush, and you know, there were reasons he was forced into it but regularly never signed it.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: But still it got done.  ELLEN W. GERBER: It got done. O.K., so Congress began to mandate at some point in the mid 70&#x27;s, &#x27;76, Congress mandated that there should be access to legal services for the poor for everyone in the United States. So they upped the budget, increased the budget in order to provide for them. They set an arbitrary and very funny figure of $7.00 per poor person. The sort of formula by which they appropriated money. But at any rate, that was Congress&#x27; idea, and so at that time then in the late 70&#x27;s, well, it must have been about &#x27;76 or so, that we got legal services in North Carolina. The bar worked on and founded it. So in the late 70&#x27;s legal services of North Carolina opened offices all over the state under their auspices so that there were the three original offices that had been funded even before the corporation act, under the old OEO, Charlotte, Winston-Salem, the Office of Economic Opportunity and that was under one of the original antipoverty programs and legal services fell under that in the Johnson era. We were and the bars were able to apply and that&#x27;s how the bars of each of those cities applied for a grant, started a legal services office in their city. So those offices have to this day remained independent in the sense that they are funded directly from Washington. Legal Services of North Carolina is the fourth grantee of the state, and it&#x27;s funded, and then it funds and oversees all the rest of the programs in the state, Burlington to Asheville, all of those. Those are all under aid service in North Carolina with which we are affiliated but we&#x27;re still funded. So that has all grown in the state, since I&#x27;ve started practicing, you know, we had developed offices all over the state. We developed consistent training programs throughout the state. There were national training programs that were wonderful. As a new lawyer I went to new advocate training in Atlanta with others from the Southeast region. There were office support back-up centers established; consumer law, housing law, family law, welfare all over the, you know that you call on to assistance and then do publications aimed at legal services. There was a training coordinator in D.C. There were all these things that were established based on this money that Congress was appropriating and supporting and the bar supported it, everything was well immersed. In 1980 when Reagan was in office, Reagan and Meese, collectively and individually, hated legal services. They hated them because when they were out in California, trying to do their dirty work in California, and to cut programs for the poor, legal services, CRLA, California Rural Legal Assistance, which is what legal services was called out there, legal services out there fought them bitterly and won in the courts and prevented them from doing these cuts. And the net result was that they were implacably opposing legal services when they came to Washington. I read an interview with Ed Meese in the American Lawyer and the chief said, in his view, legal services offices were run by lesbians who used their power to recruit so they could seduce young women attorneys. That was in print, that&#x27;s in print. Those guys were really something. So from Reagan&#x27;s first budget on, they recommended zero funding for legal services. When Jimmy Carter left office, the funding nationally was something around $316,000,000. It was cut back in 1982 to $277,000,000 nationally. You&#x27;re talking about inflation, think of inflation. It just reached in 1991 the level it was when Jimmy Carter left office. So, and in addition to cutting off funding, so, again not only are the numbers cut absolutely, but if you think of what inflation was during that decade, the numbers are cut more in half and worse. In addition to cutting the funding, they also installed in Washington, a corporation board that was opposed to legal services, hated us. And so they restaffed the office with people that hated the programs and they changed their focus, instead of assisting programs by providing training and publications and you know you&#x27;d have a monitor visit, the monitors would come down and check you out, and they were there to help you, to make your program better. Under Reagan and now Bush, the monitors were out to sabotage you, their whole focus was how they could dig up dirt to hurt you. They never had any helpful suggestions. Just the most awful stuff like the tax IRS fund while they would pick a program that was particularly effective, like a farm workers program and they would monitor them to death, hoping to reduce their effectiveness. They hated farm workers most of all. This is again the hangover from what California did against the farm workers. The farm workers are the most vulnerable minority in this country, this little group of migrant workers. You know, they were minorities to begin with and secondly they&#x27;re &quot;vagrants&quot; in a sense. You know, they have nobody to speak for them, so legal services all over the country where there are a lot of farm workers, including North Carolina, is very effective in enforcing laws that Congress and the states have passed to protect these people, which always went unenforced because of such difficulty. And legal services would go to court and have the farm workers plan to be slaves and that they&#x27;re not getting the minimum wage. That sort of thing, the housing doesn&#x27;t meet the standards of the state, the drinking water isn&#x27;t, you know there are all kinds of those things and so if there is ever a hot spot that the critics focus on is its farm workers. So you have all that sort of problem going on and in &#x27;82, &#x27;83 our office, like every office all over the country, had to face the fact that our budget had just plummeted.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How did that affect your office? Did you have a hiring freeze?  ELLEN W. GERBER: A hiring freeze would have been wonderful, that didn&#x27;t work. In a lot of offices, people quit, Reagan was very, very successful. What happened was the top staff bailed out while the bailing was good, you know they said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get a job, this is going down the tubes,&quot; and so even though the offices wouldn&#x27;t have had to cut those staff out necessarily, they left and our ranks were decimated, nationally, of the most experienced people and our back-up all was gone. To this day, you don&#x27;t get much in the way of regional training, national training anymore. But, what happened is, in our office, for some reason or another, people didn&#x27;t do that. We have always had a very good office and a very tightknit staff, and they just didn&#x27;t do that, and so we had a difficult problem, we actually had to fire people, and there was another reason why we had to do that. A lot of offices in the course of this expansion, to provide access to the people, established satellite offices, so, you know, Charlotte has one in Gastonia and, you know, each of these offices, Raleigh has Smithfield, and at some point they had a lot of them, they had more satellites than you see now. So, one of the first ways they could cut back on their budgets was to close the satellite offices. We never had any satellite offices, our director didn&#x27;t believe in it, he said the people who serve the satellite offices were the youngest, least experienced attorneys and paralegals because nobody wants to be there, one or two people in an office.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What is your territory?  ELLEN W. GERBER: North-West North Carolina. So the satellite offices idea was sort of poo-pooed in our office and we just provided by going and driving around. Anyway, so we didn&#x27;t even have that efficiency, we were efficient, we were lean and we were hard and we were mean and we didn&#x27;t have any place to cut and so the place we had to cut was salaries. You know, in an office like that 80-85% of your budget is salary. We had to do what was called, there was a word nationally that was used, not only by legal services but by others, and that was called, rifing, reduction in force, and you had to rif people, it was better than say fire them I guess. So, we had a rif.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What if you reduced the level of pay to save money?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No, no we had to lay them off, and in our office, we did something that was unbelievable, we did a paired comparison in each of the categories in which we compared each person with each other person and then basically one, you know you say, as between Lenny and Gwen, who would you retain, as between Gwen and Kristen, as between Kristen and, and you compare each person with each other person, each lawyer with each other lawyer and then, so, you add them up. And then, what we did, we brought in a consultant who did it all, consulted with us, and helped us through that process. That was pretty depressing, but we worked our way through it, we lived through it, and Reagan is gone and Bush, while hostile, is not as hostile, he doesn&#x27;t have an ideologically negative bent. And with Meese gone from the justice department, it isn&#x27;t as bad. And then, in the meantime, the Corporation has been unbelievable, they have acted like such fools. They have had one executive after another and one was caught with Twinkies and Spam in his back pocket, he was shoplifting and he was supposedly a respected attorney. And one scandal after another, and, you know, they&#x27;ve tied themselves up in knots up in Washington. They haven&#x27;t been such a bother.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How do you determine what people are eligible?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, of course a client at legal services has to be eligible, meet certain financial criteria, and that&#x27;s the bottom threshold.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How are they informed about legal services in these civil cases?  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s something the community knows these days. Of course, judges, and social workers, and even sheriffs will send people, if they don&#x27;t think to come on their own. And they come to a legal services office, the first thing they have to do, they have be checked for eligibility. If they are eligible, they are served free, at least for their attorney costs, they have to pay a court cost, but they&#x27;re eligible for free services. Then the question is, what kind of case they have, whether they have a case that&#x27;s fee-generating. By law we&#x27;re not allowed to take it, you know, if you can get a private attorney to take that case, they&#x27;ll take a tort case. Private attorney will take that case in the hopes that he or she will collect a third, and if that&#x27;s the case, we don&#x27;t take it. And there are certain cases we are not allowed to take, we don&#x27;t do abortions rights cases or immigrations rights cases or homosexual rights cases. We&#x27;re fond in our office of saying when we really want to violate the law, we represent lesbian Mexicans who want to get abortions.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Really shock them.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, and that&#x27;s the kind of nonsense. But anyway, they pass those laws, as fast as they pass them, we figure a way around them because basically all they can do is say what you can do with your Legal Services Corporation. Because they&#x27;ve been so stingy, because they&#x27;ve been so difficult, we have had to find other sources of funding. Fund raising has become a part of legal services today, it never was when I first started. The state starting two years ago and the legislature has actually appropriated a million dollars for legal services in North Carolina in each of the last three budget cuts and we hope it continues to do so. Now that money has its own restrictions, you know, not so much restrictions, but it&#x27;s pointed towards certain uses, but that&#x27;s money that isn&#x27;t Corporation money, so you can do things with that money that you can&#x27;t do with Corporation money. And then everybody raises money. Most offices now get money from their local United Ways. IOLTA gives legal services about a million dollars a year, more next year, and that money is virtually unrestricted. And so forth, so we&#x27;ve been able to use other money to do things that would not otherwise be allowed, like voting rights cases. So that&#x27;s the way its been dealt with. Now a client comes in, and if they pass the eligibility threshold, then the next question is what kind of case it is, got to pass that threshold. Sometimes they&#x27;ll come in with traffic tickets and we don&#x27;t handle it. So then an office can restrict its own cases and most do. Most do not do family law, most offices, that&#x27;s just going to eat you alive with custody battles and both sides are probably poor, so you&#x27;re in that problem. Anyway, so you&#x27;ve got to get to the type of case. And then we turn away cases that are not winnable, maybe the client does not have a good case, you know, every wrong does not have a right. The most typical example of that is the person who comes in and says, I was fired unfairly. You know, they fired me for such and such a reason, it wasn&#x27;t my fault, the real reason is, the boss didn&#x27;t like me and I want to sue. And you know, under North Carolina law, you have no remedy under most of these circumstances. So you have to say, I&#x27;m sorry. And we have controlled our case load by controlling our intake, so we only do intake two days a week, whereas once we did it four and we only do it two days now. So that kind of cuts it in half, so we only see half as many people and therefore, and by nature we&#x27;re going to get about half those cases, and that&#x27;s how we control the cases coming in. If you get to see us and you meet all those thresholds and you&#x27;ve got a worthy case, you&#x27;ll do fine.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Now that you&#x27;re retired are you still, in and out of the office?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No, no, I&#x27;ve been down. I&#x27;m weaning myself from them.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Any plans to do anything legally related?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yes, I expect to, well, mostly I&#x27;m setting up to do, very locally, wills and powers of attorney and things like that for the lesbian/gay community as a group that is always looking for the lawyers, who are on the stand. I will do that even though I haven&#x27;t managed to get myself together enough to get out letters and have business cards printed which I expect to do.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Come on, you just retired though.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right, take some time. I already have clients coming who want me to do legal work [unclear] I don&#x27;t know yet. I also expect  to do some writing and if the legal services wants me to do training, I&#x27;ll do stuff like that. I&#x27;ve been on the faculty for the NITA negotiation of Chapel Hill every year, for the last couple of years and Walker Blakey&#x27;s [unclear] . I expect to do that for a few years and there&#x27;s a  triad health project which has a lot of free legal services there [unclear]   KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Looking back, is there anything you&#x27;d change about your life - knowing what you know now?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Kristen, I just don&#x27;t think that way, you know.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, neither do I.  ELLEN W. GERBER: So, I just know, I did what I did, I did what I did, it was a fun first career and I enjoyed my second career. I think in all honesty that I was cut out to be a lawyer [unclear] . But I also am cut out to be a teacher, and I think having a  field to teach, you know, that was a silly thing for me to do physical education - I think there are other things that I could have enjoyed better in the long term, say, like history, and I actually did do that because I was working with graduate students, I think that&#x27;s the one thing in that respect. I think I got into it because I was influenced by some camp counselors who I wanted to emulate. Gym teachers who I got influenced by, but that wasn&#x27;t, I really wasn&#x27;t all that interested in sports. Anyway, [unclear]   KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What about any advice for a young female attorney entering the legal profession?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, we haven&#x27;t talked about one area, and that relates to this advice and that is, law schools almost all have women in law organizations. I think they&#x27;re very important. The fact that we have almost 50% women in law schools, does not obviate the need to have a group that you can identify with and start building systematic ties. I am a big, big believer in being part of the regular bar, you know, I go to bar meetings, I&#x27;ve taken part, I serve on committees, you know I think that&#x27;s important for anybody and it&#x27;s part of service. And, you know, I believe that if you&#x27;re a professional, that you have to relate to your profession as an institution in addition to doing your work for your clients. But the need for people to focus on women&#x27;s issues is still there. Sexism has not disappeared and the legal status of women, while it&#x27;s improved a lot, there are still many things, many issues of importance, that are more important to women than to others. Choice is a good example. You know, issues of choice? Issues of family law, I mean God knows that in the next two decades we&#x27;re going to be focusing on this issue, of when is a parent a parent. And while that of course is an issue for the male and the female, it is primarily a woman&#x27;s issue, because its women who are bearing these kids, whether they&#x27;re inseminated, or surrogate parents, or the person who wants the custody, and the child, you know, those are enormously interesting issues. Interesting lesbian issues, you know, what happens now when you&#x27;ve got two lesbians and one of them has a kid? I mean there are all kinds of lawsuits these days about visiting rights to these, you know, two lesbians getting together, and they decide, we&#x27;ll have a kid, and one of them has it, and the other one thinks, I&#x27;m a co-parent, and then they split up. What are the rights and obligations of that co-parent? These are women&#x27;s focused issues and they&#x27;ve got to be dealt with. And so, we need this now. In the years since I got out of law school, and I was part of this group, we founded the North Carolina Association of Women Attorneys and that group has become very vital over the years. It is an important group, it has lobbied the legislature-equitable distribution. I personally sat in Marissa Schoolmaker&#x27;s office with another woman attorney and drafted the original legislation of that now. It was modified of course, but, you know, and I did that as then president of the North Carolina Association of Women Attorneys. We lobbied that issue successfully, and that was ours, the women attorneys, we&#x27;re the ones that got that passed and there are other issues like that. In North Carolina up until a couple years ago, if you owned property in joint tenancy, the male was entitled to all of the rents and profits. It&#x27;s absurd, you know, a man in jail could throw his wife out of the house and install his girlfriend, which is what happened in this state because the law gave him the right to control that home, so we got that abolished by legislative lobbying. That organization has been important to say on judges. It supports people who judge, endorsements and all kinds of things. My advice to women graduating from law school is to be active in organizations like that, both locally and state-wide. Don&#x27;t say, I&#x27;ve made it, I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m equal, there&#x27;s no such thing as a woman lawyer, I&#x27;m a lawyer. I believe that in the logic, important sense, but in the political sense of getting the kind of solidarity and support that makes us count, that gives us a bigger voice than the legislature, that allows us to do something, you&#x27;ve got to have groups. I mean, that&#x27;s why you have an AMA, you know, doctors are people too, right, but they have a strong lobbying organization in Congress, everybody does, and women don&#x27;t have a lobbying organization, except for us. You know, we need to work on things like that, and so you can&#x27;t come out of college, [and say] I made it, I wasn&#x27;t discriminated, I got here on my own, I&#x27;m a bright young woman and I&#x27;ve got a career ahead of me, and why do I need women&#x27;s organizations for? The answer is you need them because we open the doors to begin with, and we&#x27;re going to open other doors, the battle isn&#x27;t over and women have to learn that the same way that blacks have to learn it. Some of the most noted black activists I know mourn that their children are uninterested in these causes. They say, well, we don&#x27;t have those laws that didn&#x27;t allow us to walk on the side of the street, and you know, they&#x27;re all gone, those Jim Crow laws. But the truth is, it isn&#x27;t just laws, laws have to be interpreted, they have be enforced, they have to be changed, you know, its an evolving process that will never stop. And maybe in a century we&#x27;ll have more equality than we do now, but we do not have it yet by a long shot. And these large numbers of very bright wonderful women graduating from law school owe it to their foremothers to keep on fighting for us, and that means banding together and getting in place to do that sort of thing. It means running for the legislature, it means really stepping out in front and realizing that in addition, and this is the kind of speech that the judges like to give to lawyers, you know, you owe service. When you get sworn in in the ceremony and in most counties, they have a big ceremony for everybody at once in the fall so, you know, 40, 50 lawyers get sworn in at once, and the presiding judge always makes nice speeches about service and stuff like that. Well, that&#x27;s real. That is real. That is something lawyers, professionals have an obligation for service, maybe everyone does, but I can&#x27;t speak to everyone. I think we would have a better country if we all were more community minded. But I would speak to the women and say, when you&#x27;re coming out of law school remember that obligation of service, and if you don&#x27;t care about women, who else is going to? So others may do something else, others may build houses for the poor, others may serve on corporate boards, and that&#x27;s fine, I have nothing against that, and maybe women ought to do that too, but don&#x27;t forget our special needs.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, thank you. I …  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  ELLEN W. GERBER: &#x27;74, about a quarter of our quest, that was a big jump, you know, that was just the beginning of a lot of women going to law school. And the law school wasn&#x27;t all that old then; it was just a few years old, but it had been not designed to have women students. That&#x27;s right. Well, let me tell you what it was like then. On the first floor, not the downstairs, but the first floor, there were two stalls on the left side. You walked in, I think there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s room there now, there were two stalls. There were no other bathrooms, there were no bathrooms on the second floor, there still aren&#x27;t and there were no bathrooms on the top floor, and then there was the basement bathroom near the lockers and that was it. Those two stalls on the first floor were all you had and we used to wait in line. You know you could not, you virtually, between classes you&#x27;d run downstairs, you could not get to the bathroom and get back up on time for class. So we started lobbying, the Women in the Law group started lobbying for the university to do something about it and so, we had a meeting one day, and the law school said, the then associate Dean Morris Geldman who has since died, and somebody else, and they came to hear our proposals, and I proposed, and the group had agreed on this, that the big bathroom on the second floor, the urinals be taken out and they put more stalls in so that everything was stalls, and then make it co-ed. Which is the way they do it in Europe, and after all, you have co-ed bathrooms at home, you know, there&#x27;s no big deal. They were outraged, outraged, and they said, this is so absurd, you&#x27;re not being serious about this, you&#x27;re not being helpful. And they walked out and they refused to do anything about it because they were so angry that we had made such a silly proposal. Now, ultimately, of course, they took the top floor and put some bathrooms in there and then they switched the ones on the second floor to make it somewhat better, but it&#x27;s still a problem. And the other thing about the law school which you may or may not know, and this was another Dan Dobb&#x27;s special, is that law school was deliberately designed to keep the faculty and the students apart.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: The wing that locks off now…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, the wing that locks off now, when I was in law school, the faculty, I had a mole in the faculty meetings, so I learned this, the faculty debated endlessly about whether or not to keep that door locked, from the second floor classroom area that went past the faculty lounge into the faculty area. They wanted the students to go downstairs through the library, come up the stairs and go back. The students unfortunately, people like me, trounced right through past the faculty lounge if they had to go to a faculty office. I mean after all, there&#x27;s a little hallway there, and walk through it to the faculty offices, and they hated that. And they wanted the students to be too timid to do that, but they weren&#x27;t and the faculty didn&#x27;t like confronting them, saying, you can&#x27;t do this, so the best solution would be to lock it. The trouble is that when you go to, when the faculty would go to the classroom, they always had books. So that means that they always had to have their key, they had their key to open their door to get through when class was over; they didn&#x27;t like that either. So they debated that for at least two of the three years I was in law school, what to do with it, to lock it up, not to lock it up, how to keep the students from marching through the…  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: With this bathroom issue and the faculty issue, there must have been some professors that were happy to see you march in 1977.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Very happy, oh yes. It wasn&#x27;t just me, there were about half a dozen of us and they…  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, I always joked that when I&#x27;m a wealthy alum, but if I ever am, rather than donate a plaque or a bench, I&#x27;m going to donate a huge, huge bathroom for women on the main level.  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s a great idea.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, thank you again.  ELLEN W. GERBER: You&#x27;re welcome, it&#x27;s a pleasure, it&#x27;s a pleasure.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: The first thing I wanted to ask you is if you could give me the title of some of the publications or books that you have written? Looking at the tapes, you had mentioned that you had authored and co-authored a couple.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, the books that I had done were in my prior career in physical education, and the first book I wrote was a book on the history of physical education and it was called Innovators and Institutions in Physical Education, and it basically investigated the people and the institutions over time, starting back in ancient Greece, who were really important to the history of physical education and went up through, primarily in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. And the second book was a collection that I edited and did introductions and bibliographies for each section called Sport and the Body: A Philosophical Symposium, and it was a collection of papers, including some of my own, on why people are involved with sports, the meaning of sports, values inherent in sports and so forth, and the body. And the third book was a book called The American Woman in Sport and four of us did the book, I did the history section and there was also a section on the philosophy, I mean on the sociology, and one on psychology and one on the physiology of women in sports. This was the first book out on women in sports and it was a textbook, and I&#x27;m still getting royalties on that. That book, I think came out, it came out before I went to law school, and I&#x27;m still getting royalties on it so that&#x27;s twenty years later.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I also wanted, just before I ask you, there&#x27;s one area I do want to pursue about your interest in women&#x27;s issues. But before we get to that, I just wanted to get a little more background on your family because when my classmates in class have been doing their oral reports that&#x27;s one of the little, and I realized listening to the tapes that I don&#x27;t have that much. I know you&#x27;re from New York, but what part of New York?  ELLEN W. GERBER: O.K., I grew up in Brooklyn.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: In Brooklyn, O.K. And your parents taught, didn&#x27;t they?  ELLEN W. GERBER: O.K., both of my parents were public school teachers in Brooklyn. My father taught in a section called Greenpoint, a junior high school, he was a history and civics teacher, that was a largely Polish section in town, and my mother taught in a section called Bensonhurst. She was a third grade, fourth grade teacher.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Siblings?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I have one sister and she lives now in Florida and has two children and both of them are married and have children, so I have nieces and greatnieces.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Are your parents still living?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Both my parents are still living.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Are you in pretty close contact with them still?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yes, as a matter of fact, I just came back from a visit where I did their taxes.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Oh, well, they must appreciate that.  ELLEN W. GERBER: My father&#x27;s 92 and he&#x27;s in a nursing home right now. He had a stroke about a year and a half ago and my mother&#x27;s in good health, thank God. She&#x27;s going to be 90 in June.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: My grandmother&#x27;s 80 today, I just mailed off her gift. What did you admire most about your parents? I mean what qualities did  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, my parents were, and perhaps they are, typical middle class Jewish Americans.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, look at me shaking my head like I know what that means.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, what it means to me, amongst other things, is they lived a marriage of equality pretty much, and that is very typical of the Jewish family. Where both parents have a role to play in the house as well as outside of the house. My father, for example, helped clean the house. He did what was called the heavy work, the vacuuming, washing the floors; he helped do the grocery shopping; he did the laundry, although that was not so typical of other families and they did things together all the time. You know, on a weekend we might all go to Prospect Park and walk, or the Botanical Gardens or some museum, or something like that. That was not atypical of them and their friends. And it was not until I got out of college that I came to understand how atypical that was in the world at large. But among Jewish families, that&#x27;s very common, that men take a much more active role in the home chores. And they both were public school teachers, so they had a sense, there was an equality of money and everything else. I remember one thing, my mother, when we were going clothes shopping, she said to my father, I need two hundred dollars or whatever, sometimes she&#x27;d ask for a hundred dollars, and he&#x27;d just opened up his wallet and gave it to her, and I said, Gee, Daddy, it&#x27;s generous, you&#x27;re good about that, and she said, well, why shouldn&#x27;t he be, it&#x27;s my money too, I earn it. You know, and I grew up that way, so that was an important quality. They both, again typically, typical middle class Jewish, they were very liberal; you know, I was taught that it would be death if I crossed a picket line and they was at one point a petition my mother took around to have something about an Asian family living in the neighborhood. I mean, you know, they did, they were not prejudiced against blacks or any other ethnic group and they taught me to be that way. They also were interested in education. The expectation that I would go to college and do something professional was there from day one and I was just brought up that way. It never occurred to me that my life could be different.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Did it shock you later when you did reach college and you were around other students, and you realized that you didn&#x27;t have similar upbringings?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yes. I think it may be typical of New Yorkers, you know. There is a wonderful New Yorker poster, I don&#x27;t know if you have ever seen it; it is sort of in the foreground, there&#x27;s like Fifth Avenue and then the …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Oh right, then the other side of the world.  ELLEN W. GERBER: May be this is true for everybody. You grow up thinking that the way of life you know is the way of life of the universe. I mean, for example, it shocked me when I went to a city and discovered there were no subways. It didn&#x27;t occur to me that subway systems were relatively rare cause I grew up in New York.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Had you traveled much outside the New York area?  ELLEN W. GERBER: We have traveled through the south. That was another very informing experience in my life. My family had taken me to Florida, I think I was probably about 13 years old. We drove down the coast, then we stopped and we visited Williamsburg and Richmond, Virginia, and things like that. I remember we went into the capitol building in Richmond, Virginia, and there were signs over the water fountains, white, black, Indian, and I said what is that? My father explained it to me. I said, but this is a government building. I couldn&#x27;t understand then, as I can&#x27;t today, how any government could ever segregate that way. And I remember from that time on driving south from that moment in Richmond, you know, noticing it. First understanding the notion of segregation, which of course, again growing up in New York, it was not apparent although I have come to think that it was there in other ways. I was just shocked; in fact, I saw beaches that had signs white Protestants only; so I learned and I also in my …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Sounds like something straight out of Capetown.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Straight out of, straight out, right here in Florida it was, or Georgia. You know, they don&#x27;t like Catholics; they don&#x27;t like Jews; they don&#x27;t like blacks. I mean, you know, it was at that time, all the prejudices were rampant and legal. And another time when I was 10 or 11, 12, that age group, my parents decide to spend the summer in the Pocono mountains and sent away for all these resort brochures. This was after WWII, and they would come and they had a big black mark like something they use when the price has been changed and they put a black mark to cover up the old price and if you held up to the light, you could see that it said, &quot;No Jews allowed.&quot; The traveling we did was largely east coast, but I learned a lot from it and how the prejudices of the world really were very strong. Again, growing up in New York, which was probably about 20 to 25% Jewish at the time.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How important was your faith to you when you were growing up? Did you have a batmitzvah?  ELLEN W. GERBER: No I did not have a batmitzvah. My sister did. I did not and that&#x27;s odd because my sister was in reform temple that we had moved when I was very young, but she continued to go that. I was an orthodox, brought up orthodox; and my parents kept a kosher home and I was not allowed. I was a girl scout leader. I was a girl scout honor scout and went to meetings on Friday evening, which they were not strict about riding in a car. Sort of outside the house you could do things, but not inside the house they weren&#x27;t allowed. So then I had a troop on Saturday morning and I was an assistant, and I felt my uniform had to be pressed. To my mother, the notion of using an iron in the house on Saturday morning was just absolutely forbidden, and I used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and iron my uniform so she wouldn&#x27;t  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Do it on the sly.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Do it on the sly. But I went through stages when I was a…I did go to Hebrew school unlike most girls. I did do what the boys did, but then I never was, of course, again I was in an orthodox temple. In those days, which would have been in the forties and early fifties, you didn&#x27;t…orthodox temples didn&#x27;t batmitzvah. I don&#x27;t know if they do now because women are not that important in an orthodox temple. You are supposed to sit separately upstairs behind a curtain.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: After listening to the tapes, one of the things that really struck me, this is moving away from your childhood, but that is the issue of your interest in women&#x27;s issues kept popping up over and over again. I was wondering what, was it a childhood experience or just the way you were raised or your educational experiences? What made you so passionate about that particular area because I know today there are so many women who are apathetic or feel powerless or just don&#x27;t - you know, why was that?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, it&#x27;s hard to put my finger on it, but there are two things that probably are relevant here. One is that I was brought up in liberal environment so when I was faced with the reality that women were put down in many ways, it was a shock to me. I didn&#x27;t sort of just accept it because you know, it&#x27;s like carrying a very heavy weight. The old story of the Greek who carries the calf. As the calf grows, he can take on the weight, take on the weight; you don&#x27;t notice so much if the change is gradual. But for me it was sudden to realize what was going on and when I was in, probably it was the early 60s when Betty Freidan&#x27;s Feminine Mystique came out. That really put a name and a face and a understanding to, you know, sort of set out what the reality so that I was able to use my intellectual skills to understand. Thirdly, I was in a field, physical education, where in those days it was still segregated. Women&#x27;s physical education and men. The gym classes were separate. That was changed, of course, by a law in the middle 70s. When I grew up they were separate and the teachers of course then were all women teachers and I went to a school that educated women to be physical educators. So I was in a group of women who all were professional and strong. So it was important to me to contrast that again with the world at large and see that women could be that way and why shouldn&#x27;t we fight for it? Then finally, and I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s appropriate I think at this point for me to say I&#x27;m a lesbian. And so I identify with women and I see them as equal to anybody in the world and [I] lived a life of equality. I don&#x27;t see any reason why everybody else shouldn&#x27;t have that opportunity if they want to. I can see that as something to fight for.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What problems do you feel are the most serious facing women today — the ones that are still unaddressed or under-addressed?  ELLEN W. GERBER: There is no question that we have not resolved the basic issue of pay equity. That&#x27;s really, women are never going to be equal if they can&#x27;t earn salaries commensurate with their skills. I don&#x27;t know how much you&#x27;ve studied about pay equity personally, but for example, women who take care of children like in a daycare center or kindergarten are paid so much less than let&#x27;s say zookeepers who take care of the animals. You think of the difference in the skill level and when they do these pay equities, that&#x27;s the kind of thing they look at. What skill is demanded, what training, what education; and the idea is that jobs that require skills, training, and education should be paid more and jobs like collecting garbage by contrast are paid less because they require no training, no skill, no education. So you look at the jobs that have been handled by women such as working with young children which should be one of the most important functions of our society and those people are paid less. Librarians, another very important job, most librarians are women; so librarians get paid practically nothing. But it used to be when men cleaned buildings or garbage trucks, they would get salaries twice as much in any given city than the city would pay its librarians. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about when I talk about pay equity and I think that&#x27;s a real important problem. I think the family issues and how to resolve them has made a lot of progress in the last decade or 20 years. It has got a long way to go still. I think men still think they are helping out. A good man is a man that really helps out a lot.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What a catch for anybody that finds one.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Right. As opposed to sharing in the responsibilities. I think there is a big difference in saying this is my job too. I went to a meeting the other day and a man was saying how busy he had been and why he had not been able to do something because he&#x27;s busy playing &quot;doctor mom&quot; because his wife has been ill. You know, I thought what do you mean &quot;doctor mom&quot;? First of all, doctor is so presumptuous, he&#x27;s a PhD, so it&#x27;s doctor mom rather than Mr. Mom. But worse, it seemed to me and that was the notion that because he was taking care of his daughter he was doing the mom function, as if the father didn&#x27;t have the exact same responsibility. That&#x27;s a realization that society is a long way from accepting. Those are two of the larger problems.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: In your career, both of your careers—your teaching and your legal career, did you experience any discrimination because you are a woman or harassment? Would you know of people that did?  ELLEN W. GERBER: You know, I thought about that question for years because I think it is one that people ask, you know. Well, why you acting as if women are harassed if you&#x27;re not harassed? They asked Hillary Clinton that the other day and it was hard for her to put her finger on why she did. I think it&#x27;s not easy to know when you&#x27;ve been discriminated against. If you compete with somebody for a job, a male and he gets it and you don&#x27;t. Is it because you&#x27;re a women or because your credentials were less good and so forth? For the most part, because again, my first career I was a woman in a woman&#x27;s field, women&#x27;s physical education. I didn&#x27;t experience personal discrimination vis à vis the others, but as a whole we got less than the men. The women athletes got next to nothing to run our programs. Our offices in the last place I worked, every woman shared a office and no male did for example. We would go to a conference, I remember this was in 1970 I went to a conference in Asheville from Massachusetts. I was teaching at the University of Massachusetts and we went to a conference in Asheville. The conference was like a week long and I got x amount of dollars from the University to help pay for my expenses, and the men in December had a conference in Asheville at the same place and their conference was five days long and they all got, each got more money than we did. So, you know, those little incidents, what we used to call clicks, would come up and you would notice it. Those were minor points, but they add up to many, many, many major points. So, yes. When I got out of law school, the big law firms were beginning to hire women. One. You could see that Womble had a woman, not a partner at the time. Petree had a woman. Everybody had a woman and it was very clear to me that they would never hire me. Because if they were going to hire one woman, she was going to be young and cute. I think that was obviously a form of discrimination. I was asked many times about my interest in women&#x27;s issues because that was on my resume that I was in [the] Woman in Law [organization], and it was clear to me that they were negative to me because I had those interests. It was like a good team player that merely focused on those things. When we first founded, and I was one of the founding members of the North Carolina Association of Women Attorneys, the largely male at that time bar �� the standard bar — was very aggravated at the notion of having a woman&#x27;s bar. And many of the women, especially those who were successful and who were working for largely male law firms and who had been accepted would say, &quot;Why do we need a woman&#x27;s bar? See I have this job. You can get one.&quot;  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, you had mentioned earlier that that&#x27;s one of your warnings to a young female attorney starting out is don&#x27;t turn your backs just because you personally have not suffered from it.  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s right. Because first of all you don&#x27;t realize there are still these glass ceilings and these types of quotas and there are still these sort of very subtle put downs, you know. I think it is beginning to change enormously. In the law, for example, there are just so many women graduating that you couldn&#x27;t say, well, women can&#x27;t be litigators for example. And so then of course once women go out and they are successful litigators, then it helps to pave the way for somebody else. But that&#x27;s still a battle that is being fought. There are still people who are doubtful. There are still clients who aren&#x27;t necessarily comfortable because they have a woman representing them. Big fat cat business men and that kind of thing. They just sort of assume that women aren&#x27;t interested, and I think that&#x27;s an ongoing problem. We had to fight to have the regular bar accept the women attorneys as being important and worth supporting and having a function. My view always was and most of my colleagues who founded the women attorneys always was, we weren&#x27;t saying join the women attorneys and don&#x27;t join the North Carolina Bar Association for example. That isn&#x27;t the point, it is that the North Carolina Bar Association is not going to spend time and energy essentially worrying about women&#x27;s issues. They are not going to send people to lobby on those issues. They are not going to focus on things that are of special interest to women. And as long as we live in a society where things are not 100% equal, there will always be women&#x27;s issues.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: How did you go about organizing the group?  ELLEN W. GERBER: How did that start? Well, a handful of women got together. I was not one of those few. One was Carolyn McAlister, who graduating a year ahead of me at Carolina, and Sharon Thompson, - so those two were very actively involved and two or three other women who decided we ought to have such a group.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: When was that?  ELLEN W. GERBER: That was about 1978 or thereabouts. So after talking about it, they invited a number of women to join with them in sort of an internal governing body and we met for about a year or two. Oh, about eight or ten of us were working on a constitution and bylaws and an organization, drawing up the outline: what should this organization look like, who should be members, should men be allowed to join if they wanted to, should students be voting members, what kind of committee should the committee have, who would comply to the executive board.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What was the vote on male members?  ELLEN W. GERBER: We agreed to have male members. We agreed to have anyone be permitted to join, any practicing attorney could join if they wanted to because we realized that if you were interested in the organization and its goals, you should be allowed to join, and we have always had some male members in the organization. Sid Eagles, for example, was a member. He is running for the Supreme Court now and has asked for the organization&#x27;s endorsement. Unfortunately, he is running against a woman. Going to be a tough decision — Sarah Parker. But some of our members&#x27; husbands joined, for example, as a gesture of solidarity. We agreed, we have Murph Archibald, who is a lawyer in Charlotte, has been a member and comes to our meeting every year, our annual meeting. On students, initially the organization voted against students being full voting members. I think they had in mind groups like the National Lawyers Guild which was so student-oriented that the students had virtually taken over the organization. They were afraid that the students would join in large numbers, but not women attorneys and that somehow would be leaning toward student interests. I opposed that strongly. I urged students to be full members and after a few years when the organization got going, they went back and redid the bylaws and students are now full voting members. The people who opposed me on that have been gracious enough to say that they were wrong. But I have always been a great fan of students, so I was one of those when I was teaching at the university who always wanted students on committees and that sort of thing.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: What about the future?  ELLEN W. GERBER: What&#x27;s the future? It is also a voice, it&#x27;s also a voice. It seems to me that if you&#x27;re a part of a community, you have something to say. Your point of view is your point of view. You know, you come to it from a different stage in your life and it may be different for good reasons or it may be different for invalid reasons, but nevertheless, it is a point of view. It just seems to me that inclusion in any context is better than exclusion. If you have community members, I mean I would have the janitor&#x27;s job, you know, why not? In my office for example, in our legal services office, we always had a hiring committee composed of anyone in the office that wanted to be on the committee.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Oh, as you mentioned before, that person has an interest better that they should be …  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s right. And while the committees have always been weighted with attorneys for when we were hiring an attorney, but we have always had at least one paralegal who chose to sit in. And if a secretary had wanted to, that would have been fine. As a result, we have done wonderful hiring through the years. I think that always works out always, if you trust people to do the right thing.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Well, here&#x27;s another question that popped into my head. How do you feel about the, what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for? Well, it seems like now a days a lot of attorneys get a bum wrap, just public view of attorneys, public perception of attorneys. Over your many years of practice, do you feel that most of the attorneys that you came into contact with—I imagine the ones you work with were wonderful people and you have nothing but praise for them—but what about your average opposing counsel that you came up against, the counsel that represented perhaps a large corporate interest?  ELLEN W. GERBER: I have two responses to that. First, I do think attorneys get a bum wrap as a general principle. The thing that people think is that they are greedy and that they have created a litigious society. I think that is absolutely an erroneously concept. I had an argument with some close friends the other day whose son-in-law is being sued and they kept saying it&#x27;s the greedy lawyers&#x27; fault and I kept saying no. The person who is suing your son went to a lawyer. The lawyer did not stand in the middle of the street and say, hey, you know, I&#x27;m ready to sue if you&#x27;ll come. The person went to the lawyer. Lawyers only represent their clients and most of these, when people talk about greedy lawyers, they are talking about tort suits and they think how much the lawyer gets. They don&#x27;t understand that a lawyer might take five or eight tort suits and lose most of them and only win one or two of them. If they lose, they get nothing. They could put in hundreds of hours of work for nothing, especially these big medical malpractice suits. I&#x27;ve seen lawyers that locally lose and get zero. So I think that&#x27;s a bum wrap and I don&#x27;t think lawyers are greedy. I think they&#x27;re hard working and for the most part and do their jobs in the way that the public would support. But having said that, I must say that the shoddiness of people&#x27;s work shocks me. I just cannot believe what poor jobs my fellow members of the bar do in most cases. They seem—the standards and I blame the law schools for part of this because clearly they are graduating without any standards for excellent work. That&#x27;s partly because law schools don&#x27;t teach them how to work. They only teach them how to analyze cases and basically they are not getting any models of what it means to really handle a case, to do discovery properly, to do a thorough job in researching and drawing up pleadings. They just don&#x27;t do it, they just don&#x27;t do it. They&#x27;re trial preparation is sort of back of the pants, seat of the cuff. There&#x27;s something wrong with that image, but you&#x27;ve got the idea. Seat of the pants. As a matter of fact, the session I was doing yesterday was training new lawyers case management—from case acceptance up to the preparation of the trial. I was saying you must learn to do all of these things. These are not luxury things that you do on a rare case; these are something you do on every case. At one point, I was talking about formal discovery and I said the biggest mistake I see even in my office and I always have to urge people, you send out this fat package of interrogatories, and make a request to produce, and back comes a fat package. They put it in a file to look at some later date and I say that&#x27;s just not acceptable because you need to review it. You need to see if you need a motion to compel, you need to see if everything is there, you need to see if there are follow-ups. The bar doesn&#x27;t do that. By and large, the vast numbers of attorneys practicing in one, two, three person firms, they represent too many people. They do routine things and they just don&#x27;t spend the time in preparing and building a case. It&#x27;s a whole lower standard and they learn that from each other because it has never been a point in time when they developed a habit of what a real case handler would do. I don&#x27;t think the public understands that part, you know. I think the public&#x27;s feelings about lawyers is based on what they see: big settlements and the feeling that smart lawyers get criminals off and things like that. They resent that, but what they ought to resent is the shoddiness of the work and they don&#x27;t understand it when they have their own lawyers. I have seen people come with documents that have been prepared and they&#x27;re just not thoughtful, they&#x27;re not personalized in a sense. Lawyers tend to use forms and just use them. Often they have their secretaries fill them in. Creditor, I&#x27;ve seen creditor, what I consider debt collection violations, because the stuff in there is inaccurate and a mess, and it&#x27;s because they just have a single formula for doing it. And they hand it to their secretary, they pay no attention, they don&#x27;t keep file notes, you write them a letter and I&#x27;m representing the client, and therefore, you can&#x27;t contact them again, and the next thing you know, your client gets a letter and you say to them, hey, that&#x27;s a debt collection violation. Oh, it was a mistake and my secretary sent it out. Which is true, I mean, they don&#x27;t intend to be bad, I believe that, but those mistakes should not happen. And they wouldn&#x27;t happen if the lawyers take charge, and I could go on and on with that kind of story. Cases that we win, all the time, I can always count on lawyers to do a lousy cross-examination, making my client tell the story ten times over.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Do you think that contributed in part, at least in small part, to your success, that you were so…  ELLEN W. GERBER: Sure, absolutely, cause we&#x27;re super prepared. And even though we represent, as Legal Services attorneys, clients who are not respected, and in fact are considered dead-beats not having paid their rent, not having paid their debts, we win because we&#x27;re prepared and the other lawyers aren&#x27;t. They haven&#x27;t researched the law, they haven&#x27;t looked at anything, so they get up there and assume they&#x27;re going to win, and they don&#x27;t.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: While you were practicing, did you have any role models in the legal community, I mean, anybody you especially look up to, male or female?  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, Dan Pollitt is high on my list, is probably number one, for somebody who has always devoted his life to public service. I think that&#x27;s really one of the most important role models. If you&#x27;re talking about role models in terms of skill development, no, I had to make, I had to become the role model for myself and others, and it was a painful lesson how to do it. I don&#x27;t, and there were too few people. Certainly, Jim Gulick in our office, was a good …  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: The interesting thing about Professor Pollitt, we had a large, you know a kind of spoof night at school, where we did a retirement tribute to Dan Pollitt, and while he was on stage, they showed slides and they played sappy music, and you know, he made a speech and everything. But I love him and what a wonderful feeling it must be for him to look back at this life that not only is he doing something that he loves, but to know that he is so well respected, also that he has been serving the people, and he hasn&#x27;t pulled out.  ELLEN W. GERBER: That&#x27;s right.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: You know, look back at 70s, you know, he is…and I imagine you are a role model to some of the people you&#x27;ve touched, you know, in your life.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, I hope so. And I think that people have been generous enough to say so, and I&#x27;ve tried to be, I really think that&#x27;s important for them to understand that you can live in that uncompromising way, to do the job the way it needs to be done. There&#x27;s someone else I want to mention too who was important, and that is Barry Nakell. Barry has had some hard times lately and but when I was a student, Barry was one of the few professors who was out there really doing good public service work. And he has been terrific, he had never stopped and never lost that. He&#x27;s being punished for it at the moment, but we shouldn&#x27;t forget - Lee v. Bounds was a very significant case, in North Carolina and nationally. And because of that our prisoners have representation on levels that he could find any input in any other state, and Barry Nakell brought that about.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I&#x27;m thankful that he&#x27;s coming back in the fall.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yes.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: For a while there the students were feeling that the school was just trying to sweep everything under the carpet, and like all the problems that have been following him didn&#x27;t exist. But he was certainly missed this year.  ELLEN W. GERBER: There are also some women who have made a wonderful mark here in North Carolina, I think we also grew up together and they weren&#x27;t out there as role models for me because they were not fully developed then either. But there are some women attorneys in this state who have just made incredible differences, and would you like to know a couple of them?  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I sure would.  ELLEN W. GERBER: OK, let&#x27;s start with Leslie Winner, who right now is running for the state senate from Charlotte, I don&#x27;t know if you know her. She has worked, she started out as Legal Services attorney and then for the last several years has worked for, what&#x27;s the firm, Chambers, Stein, is now Ferguson, Stein &amp; Watt, whatever, and she&#x27;s the one who did all of the work, including right up to the trial, right up to the U.S. Supreme Court, when Julius Chambers did the arguing on Jingles, which is the redistricting case that really changed the face of North Carolina, and as a result of which, in the follow-up work she did, going around suing all of the communities across the state, we now have blacks on city councils, boards of education, and county commissioners, and things like that we never had before, and in the state legislature, larger numbers than ever. That&#x27;s Leslie&#x27;s work, the Voting Rights Act has just been applied to North Carolina because of her work. Sharon Thompson, whose first few years were spent as legislator and before and since then has represented Planned Parenthood and other groups like in the legislature as a lobbyist. Because of Sharon Thompson, North Carolina has always supported abortions, or that is, paid for them, when Medicaid stopped funding them. We are one of about 14 states in the country that fund abortions for poor women, and we have withstood all the challenges of parental consent, and all these other limitations that people try to put on them, and Sharon has single-handedly been responsible for that.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: Where is she located?  ELLEN W. GERBER: She&#x27;s in Durham, she&#x27;s a terrific attorney.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I&#x27;d love to speak with her sometime, I wrote a paper for Constitutional Law about parental consent and notification statutes.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Well, you can find her,  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: It&#x27;s fascinating but also very scary.  ELLEN W. GERBER: Yeah, very. Well, we just defeated that again in the legislature, this time because they brought in those parents of that women who had died. So she&#x27;s been another terrific one. Angie Bryant, who was also in law school for about a year, a black woman, who had been on the industrial commission, and just worked really hard on the inside to bring women&#x27;s, in particularly black women&#x27;s, issues to the fore. When she was an industrial commissioner, then people would come and represent maybe a black plaintiff, and they would ask her, I mean a black defendant, and the lawyers who were representing the insurance companies when there was a black plaintiff or petitioner, would come along and ask her to recuse herself, because after all, she was a black woman on the bench, and she would be sympathetic, forgetting all the years that they were budsies, budsies with white males. Right, so Angie has been a very important person, right there in the middle of all of things. Right now she&#x27;s not being an attorney, she&#x27;s working on some other projects involving race relationships. And I should mention Laura Hays, Laura practices in Chapel Hill, the Southern Environmental Law Center, she heads the center there, they&#x27;ve done some really important law suits in this state. And she too started her career in Legal Services. I saw her when they were trying to decide whether the state, the Department of Human Resources, should pay to fund abortions for poor women. I saw her turn the Board around in five minutes, they said they would give her five minutes to speak, and not a second more, they really didn&#x27;t want to hear, they had their mind made up they were not going to do it, and Laura stood up there and in five minutes changed them. That was probably 1978, and it passed, from that day to this we still have abortion funding for poor women. Ah, she has just a bang-up job as an environmental lawyer. So these are some of the women I came out of law school about my time, and they&#x27;ve just been terrific, just great people.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I think I&#x27;ve mentioned to you before, that by interviewing you I&#x27;ll be giving the only report on a woman, so you will be the first woman attorney included in the Southern Oral History Project, and thank you so much.  ELLEN W. GERBER: I think it&#x27;s a pleasure.  KRISTEN L. GISLASON: I really do appreciate it, and I&#x27;ll shut this off before I ramble too much.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Born in Wilkes County, North Carolina, during the early 1930s, Junior Johnson describes what it was like to grow up in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where moonshining was a commonplace local enterprise. It was because of moonshining, in fact, that Johnson first learned to drive cars, having watched his father and older fathers &quot;haul whiskey.&quot; Drawn to cars and fast driving at an early age, Johnson soon became a well-known stock car driver in the region. Johnson speaks at length about what it was like to be one of the founding participants in the then-nascent industry. According to Johnson, stock car drivers were motivated by a competitive drive and a desire to race for the sake of racing. Moreover, Johnson discusses how stock car drivers in the 1950s were known for their propensity to party and shirk the law. He was able to avoid the former, but not the latter, and served 18 months in prison for moonshining, which he describes as a positive, life-altering experience. He retired from driving at the age of 31, having accomplished all of his racing goals. From them on, Johnson participated in the building of the NASCAR empire by running his own race team. From an insider&#x27;s perspective, Johnson describes the technological innovations that shaped the evolution of the sport and the changing role of sponsors and audience. In addition to describing his role in the shaping of NASCAR, Johnson talks about his other business endeavor as a poultry farmer for Holly Farms in Wilkes County. Following his success with NASCAR, Johnson and his wife (a childhood sweetheart) returned to Wilkes County as their home base. He describes how that area changed over the course of his lifetime. Finally, Johnson briefly discusses Tom Wolfe&#x27;s interview of him and his short prison sentence in the 1950s.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  PETE DANIEL: [This is an interview with Junior Johnson. It&#x27;s being done on June 4, 1988, at Dover, Delaware, at the Dover Downs Race Track.] I think most people would want to know about your family background. That is, how long have the Johnsons been up in the mountains of North Carolina?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, my grandpa lived in the same area where I live now and my father lived since about the 1900&#x27;s. That&#x27;s where my father was born, in that same area, and it was where me and my brothers and sisters all was born and raised up.  PETE DANIEL: Could you just put on for the record your parents&#x27; names?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Robert Glenn Johnson, Sr. and Lora Money Johnson.  PETE DANIEL: Did you go to school right there in your neighborhood?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: A little community called Clemmon. We went to school there up until we finished the seventh grade, and then you moved on to a high school called Ronda for the rest of your years in school. I only went to the seventh, I mean through the seventh and started in the eighth, and I quit school in the eighth.  PETE DANIEL: Were any of your teachers particularly significant in your life?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: All of my teachers was very significant in my life. I had a teacher called Tom Calloway that was one of the, I thought, smartest persons I&#x27;d ever seen in my childhood years. I also had a teacher called Nola Howard. She was really a great person, and still living. She retired from teaching several years ago. She was a patient, good person, and she really took a lot of time with her school kids.  PETE DANIEL: Do you have friends now that you grew up with back there?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yes, I still live in the same territory or area where I was born and all. I grew up there and I still live there, and all the neighbors and friends and relatives still live in the same area where I growed up. All of my friends are still there.  PETE DANIEL: Did you have any particular person you looked up to and sort of set as a role model when you were growing up?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I looked up to my father a lot because I thought my father was one of the most knowledgeable people about everything that he went to do. You know, farming, he was in the whiskey business when I was a young boy. He had more knowledge about everything that he did, and anything that anybody wanted to do, he knew how to do it and how to go about it and stuff. I&#x27;ve always felt like if I could grow up and be like my father, I&#x27;d be happy and satisfied with my life, and I still feel that way about it. He was the one person in my eyes as far as I was concerned.  PETE DANIEL: Was he a farmer, mostly? Is that what he did mostly?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: He farmed for a living, but back in them days you could just survive on a farm. In that area of North Carolina where I lived was kind a a moonshining area. Of course, about everybody who lived around where I lived was either involved in it one way or the other, or they sold the material to make it with, or they had some connection with the moonshine business. Course, he, by his being that close around it, and him being where he could get involved in it, he got involved in it.  PETE DANIEL: What did folks do for leisure? You were growing up mostly in the what, late &#x27;30s and early &#x27;40s, on through there. Did you have movies? What all did you do for recreation?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Most of the time radio was about the only communication you had with the outside world, at the time that I was growing up. Television didn&#x27;t come along until quite some years after I was growing up. But radio was about all your connections with the outside part of the United States, our world, far as that goes.  PETE DANIEL: What did y&#x27;all listen to?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Ah, stuff like the Grand Ole Opery on Saturday night. They had various programs on that most all the family, like Amos and Andy, this type of program was basically what everybody listened to and followed and all. You know, through every day there were certain things on that they kept up with. That&#x27;s some of the most famous ones.  PETE DANIEL: Was religion a big part of life growing up?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Religion was pretty well taught in everybody&#x27;s home because they had plenty of time to go to church and raise their kids in a religious type atmosphere. They didn&#x27;t have all the things like they have today to go to to get &#x27;em away from religion. So about all families were very religious.  PETE DANIEL: Well, changing the subject a little bit, what kind of food was your favorite growing up?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Basically vegetarian type of stuff that come out of the garden that we growed on the farm was basically my prime foods and still is today. Stuff like potatoes, pinto beans, stuff that you grow in the garden, normally.  PETE DANIEL: Did kids in those days have milestones? I know when you grow up on a farm, a lot of times you have chores and then you&#x27;ll sort of, you get a driver&#x27;s license or join the church or get your first shotgun or maybe kill your first deer? Were there things like that that kind of marked growing up for you?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: It was getting a car, was the basic—about every young boys&#x27; dream, you know, in growing up, especially in the area where I lived cause a car at the time was unheard of. About one family out of ten had cars. That was about the extent of it. If you was lucky enough to make enough money to buy a car, you was like the kid on the block, you might say. And about everybody worked frantically towards that goal when he&#x27;s going to have his own  PETE DANIEL: Who taught you to drive?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: My Daddy, I think, had a big influence on me, and I had two brothers that was very influencing on driving. Both of them was older than I was, and they was kind a in the moonshine hauling business. I picked up on fast cars and stuff because I seen them doing &#x27;em and driving &#x27;em and had an opportunity to see their mistakes and stuff. And I picked up on the fast cars and driving basically when I was just a young boy through my father&#x27;s effort of trying to have fast cars to haul whiskey with and my brothers.  PETE DANIEL: What were your brothers&#x27; names?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: L.P. and Fred Johnson.  PETE DANIEL: And you learned how to drive with them sort of as your teachers?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That and seeing mistakes that they made when they was growing up. They was a little older, and I&#x27;d see them make mistakes in driving, and I tried to better myself by capitalizing on their mistakes.  PETE DANIEL: What kind of mistakes would they make?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, they&#x27;d wreck cars and tear &#x27;em up a lot, that type of thing. I tried to avoid all that stuff I could because I could see what kind a shape they was in when they wrecked. Sometimes I was with them in a car and the car would get away from &#x27;em and they&#x27;d tear it up, that type of stuff.  PETE DANIEL: You think you had a real nak for driving?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I think I did. I think I was gifted with the feel of an automobile to correct any situation I got into when I got a little older. I basically could outguess what the car was going to do.  PETE DANIEL: How do you explain having that gift? I mean your brothers were probably really good drivers but you come along being the younger one and seemed to have a better hand at it than they do.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I think you build your confidence in what you think you can do and what you can&#x27;t. And when you get your confidence so high, you don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any kind a position that you can get a car in that you can&#x27;t correct it and save it. Confidence has a lot to do with how you drive an automobile, especially in a racing application.  PETE DANIEL: So how&#x27;d you get interested in racing?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: They built a local speedway there close to where I lived, and one thing led to another. I was sort of the brave type young boy that lived in the community. If there was something that nobody else couldn&#x27;t do, I&#x27;d either try it or do it, one of the two. I became a little bit more braver than most of the other guys did. And it wasn&#x27;t long until I was in the racing, proving that I was braver than the rest of &#x27;em. And it just kept growing from that on to, the first thing I knew I was in racing full-time.  PETE DANIEL: When you say braver, you mean you were willing to go harder and take more chances and have the confidence that you could pull it off.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That&#x27;s true. That was one of my beliefs that I felt very strongly about, that as long as I was controlling the wheel, that I could do anything with that automobile that I wanted to and still save it, not wreck it and tear it up.  PETE DANIEL: When you were starting out like that, were you doing any work on the cars or were you just driving?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I worked on the cars a tremendously lot when I was driving &#x27;em because it become pretty, well, it become pretty important that you know what it took to make the cars do what you wanted &#x27;em to do, that you knew what the car was going to perform like. So you can take care of the unexpected basically. That was basically the reason I wanted to work on them, so I&#x27;d know what it took.  PETE DANIEL: So you learned how to build engines and tune suspensions and all that as you came along?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: As I came along and through trial and error, I kept making &#x27;em better and better. It wasn&#x27;t long until I could, in any kind a situation, I could tell you where it was good or bad and what it was going to do.  PETE DANIEL: Did it take you long to start winning after you got into racing?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I was winning right away. I went right into it, right off the bat, started winning.  PETE DANIEL: Well, I think anybody that is going back and study the early days of racing, would kind of be interested in what kind of an operation those early racing days were, back in the &#x27;50s. That is, did people have, I know they didn&#x27;t have the support they do today but what kind of support did they have? Did you have a garage, you have a sponsor, or anything like that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, it was a rarity to see somebody with a sponsor. What you&#x27;d do, you would get some friends and y&#x27;all would start either a race operation, or you would basically put a bunch of guys together and each guy would put x amount of dollars in it, and you&#x27;d go racing. You more or less raced because you wanted to. You couldn&#x27;t afford to, and you couldn&#x27;t make no money out of it. It was just basically because you wanted to.  PETE DANIEL: Were the tracks any good back in those days?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, most of them was dirt. They pretty well proved that if you had a good enough car and a good enough driver, you could take dirt and show your talents and overcome most of the other competitors.  PETE DANIEL: Driving on dirt must be a lot different than driving on a track like this.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yes, it takes a lot of, a different style or type of driving. You broadside a car quite a bit when you&#x27;re running dirt. When you&#x27;re running asphalt, you basically have to take a car down in the corner, and kind a finesse it through the corner to keep it from getting sideways or doing anything like that. On dirt you run it sideways all the time.  PETE DANIEL: I think I saw you drive in &#x27;57 or so, &#x27;56. I grew up in a little town close to Wilson, North Carolina. Ya&#x27;ll were at the Wilson fairgrounds, and I&#x27;m pretty sure you were there.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I run Wilson a lot. It was a good dirt track, and it put on a good show.  PETE DANIEL: You ever think about the influence that you and all those people you were driving with had on people like me who would come to races. You ever think about what we thought of you?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, not so much back in the early days. It was basically trying to prove to the other drivers that you was a better driver than they was, and you could outdrive them. The fans back then weren&#x27;t, you know, they weren&#x27;t figuring in what we do today, back then. Cause today the fans are what brings us to the race track, what supplies the money to pay the bills. The fans are basically our financing. Back then, they weren&#x27;t so much because we was doing it for the fun of it, more than anything else. And we didn&#x27;t need financing much. We just, all we needed was a place for somebody to say, &quot;Just come and race,&quot; and we&#x27;d go. [Laughter]   PETE DANIEL: Well, just to get off the subject just a little bit here, almost every book you read on the early days of stock car racing talks about not just the legendary drivers but all the hell that was raised by those drivers on Saturday night and probably during the rest of the week. Was it really that wild back in those days?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, it was because that was part of the reason that we went to the race track. You know, seeing who was the best partier was just as important almost as seeing who was the best driver. And I don&#x27;t think people was partying just to see how much hell they could raise. I think it was more a way of life with them. let&#x27;s go have a drink and have a good time and so on and so forth. And it grew into something that was kind a exposed. I don&#x27;t know if everybody wanted it exposed or not but that&#x27;s what it kind a grew into.  PETE DANIEL: I&#x27;ve never seen your name connected too much with that in all the accounts I&#x27;ve read. I guess you were there though.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I&#x27;ve never been much of a party person. I&#x27;ve been to parties. People can do what they want to. But there&#x27;s two ways to look at that. If you are getting anything out of it and you enjoy doing it, it&#x27;s fine. If you&#x27;re not, then you need to be doing something you like to do. You know, going somewhere or another where you like to go, and stay away from that stuff. It&#x27;s just one of them things that I never really picked up on. Not that I haven&#x27;t been to some and all but it was not my big thing, really.  PETE DANIEL: You seem like you&#x27;re a lot more thoughtful and reflective about things than other drivers that I&#x27;ve met. You seem to have a way of approaching things very calmly and you&#x27;re not excitable or anything like that. I would think that would figure in that you probably wouldn&#x27;t like parties all that good.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I don&#x27;t like to do things that I don&#x27;t think out thoroughly—are they the best thing for me, are they the best thing for the people I&#x27;m involved in, or what I should or should not do? For that reason, nothing much seems to excite me like, somebody says, &quot;Let&#x27;s go party and raise cain tonight.&quot; I don&#x27;t see no benefit in that. If you want to drink a beer or do something, that&#x27;s your business. Going out and getting drunk and raising Cain, I just don&#x27;t see no sense in it. There ain&#x27;t nothing there to be gained, as far as I can tell.  PETE DANIEL: Well, let&#x27;s go back to racing. Who do you think in your day were the best drivers, if you could name about half a dozen of those that you drove against that you thought came closest to you?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Curtis Turner, Fireball Roberts. I think coming on at the end of my career, Cale Yarborough was certainly a driver who was in the category of myself and Turner and so on. We had guys when I was driving like Roy Hall and Tim and Fonty Flock. Bob Flock was a tremendous race driver. Herb Thomas was a very good race driver. These are some of the guys that I ran against that was excellent race drivers.  PETE DANIEL: What in your opinion makes a driver fast?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Nerve, one word, that&#x27;s it.  PETE DANIEL: Like, if you have the nerve, then how do you graduate them, something like intelligence or reflexes or aggressiveness, or maybe just meanness, be a part of that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, if you&#x27;ve got the nerve, then all you&#x27;ll have to do is keep working till you get with the right team to where you&#x27;ve got the speed. Then you put both of them together and you&#x27;ve got something that nobody can basically cope with. We have a boy in our sport right now, don&#x27;t have the fastest car but he&#x27;s got the nerve. He&#x27;s one notch up on everybody.  PETE DANIEL: Who&#x27;s that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Dale Earnhart.  PETE DANIEL: Speaking of nerve, do you or any other drivers that have that—when you&#x27;re out there, what&#x27;s going through your mind? Are you calculating or is it just something you&#x27;re born with and go with?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Something you&#x27;re born with, and you use it as a weapon. But if you&#x27;re smart, you use it sort of unnoticeable. It pays off more to keep it to yourself and don&#x27;t expose it unless you have to.  PETE DANIEL: But people know that when the chips are down, that you&#x27;re never going to back off.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That&#x27;s right, and that&#x27;s when it pays off. Because if you use it any other time, to where it&#x27;s not a profitable tool, you&#x27;ve basically wound up making somebody mad at you because, it didn&#x27;t mean anything. They feel like you&#x27;ve run over &#x27;em or you did something to &#x27;em for nothing. You need to save all your nerve and skills and stuff till it&#x27;s real important. Then use them. Then they understand why you did what you did. You out nerved &#x27;em or what not. They know why you did it.  PETE DANIEL: Awhile ago, we talked about the fifties and you said that when you were going through it, you probably weren&#x27;t really aware of how significant what you were doing was. But when you look back on it now, you&#x27;re sitting up here on a race track in Dover, Delaware, and stock car racing is one of the biggest things in the country—one of the biggest spectator sports in the whole country—and it was you and men like you that really got it started. Do you look back on that as being as significant as say, people who were starting up rock and roll at the same time or people who were in the movies like James Dean? How do you see your self in all that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I basically look back over it now, and I can see how my career and people like Curtis Turner&#x27;s career, Fireball Roberts&#x27; career, were so devastating in promoting and pushing racing to the point it is now. We did it with bullishness, use our nerve to present to the public our skills that people could not understand and believe that people would do some of the things we was doing. Why would you want to go out and try to kill yourself to prove that you could outdrive another guy, or you have the best racing team or the best car, whatever? To start with, it was like we was all crazy, and we might have been cause, like I said before, we did it mostly for fun to start with because we all enjoyed the challenge. And we didn&#x27;t make that much money, so the crews, the guys that we&#x27;s friends with, would pool their money. We&#x27;d put it all in a car and go see if we could beat the other guy. So it was definitely a challenge to us more so than the money cause wasn&#x27;t that much money in it.  PETE DANIEL: You think the fans came because they knew that y&#x27;all were out there and you were going to race. Why do you think fans come to watch it?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, to start with they came to watch, what I would call, a bunch of fools. But in the same reality, it was disbelief to the fans that you could take a car and do with it what we could do with cars. Basically, we&#x27;d run &#x27;em sideways and backwards and about anyway you wanted to see one, in whatever position you wanted to see it in. We could get &#x27;em in that position and still save &#x27;em and not wreck &#x27;em a lot of times. A lot of times we would wreck &#x27;em but it was a disbelief to the fans to start with, I think. It brought them out to the race track. Then it become, as time went along, it started to be a sport because it was their favorite driver against somebody else&#x27;s favorite driver. So, it just kept growing. They started following certain people and going to certain race tracks, seeing what was entertainable to them. The sport raised itself up. It just kept growing by leaps and bounds. Then we got television, and it wasn&#x27;t long before we got national sponsorship. It&#x27;s just beyond where anybody ever thought it would go to. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s close to being over with or how far it&#x27;ll go.  PETE DANIEL: Couple of years ago we had another conversation about this, and you made the statement that it&#x27;s all been tamed now. And I kind of picked up in your voice that you were kind of ambivalent about that. You weren&#x27;t sure that was all together a good thing or all together a bad thing.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I think it&#x27;s good that we have a control atmosphere on it where we can stop a crisis or something of that nature. It&#x27;s not as colorful now as it was then because, regardless of how you look at it, if the sport is rambunctious, exciting, a lot of controversy, I guess you could say, going on all the time, it makes for good entertainment. And for that reason, I think, it might be getting to the point where we&#x27;re taming it down. It could hurt the fans&#x27; interest in it.  PETE DANIEL: There&#x27;s a part of the &#x27;50s and, I guess, the &#x27;60s that isn&#x27;t generally known to a lot of people except those who really follow races, and that was the fact that Wendell Scott raced all through that time even though it was a very, sort of tense time as far as race relations. That&#x27;s an interesting thing because a lot of times people think of racers as kind of a closed minded people and all that. How was that era when he was driving? Was he welcomed or was he just kind of, how did that go?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: He was certainly welcomed everywhere he went. All the people that I know helped Wendell in many, many ways. I know my crew and I did a lot of things for Wendell. We give him parts and stuff to try to help him along the way. He was a very well mannered gentlemen, and he didn&#x27;t try to present a problem around the race track. He wanted to be part of our sport, and he was part of it. Wendell was very limited in his resources and things he could do and all. I don&#x27;t know if I could have lived underneath the strain that Wendell lived under and kept on racing. I think I would have quit. You gotta give him credit for keep plugging away at it and trying to come up with a professional organization where he could go out and really show his talents and stuff. I think if he&#x27;d had the right situation, he could have been pretty successful.  PETE DANIEL: I got the impression from what I&#x27;ve read that his reason for driving was just like what you said about everybody else—he wanted to race. He felt compelled to go out and race.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yeah.  PETE DANIEL: Have you still got some time?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yeah.  PETE DANIEL: I&#x27;ve got some more things to ask you. What do you think your most important contribution was, as a driver?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I think I contributed a self confident skill to the sport that people still live by. And that&#x27;s guts and nerve, where you basically do your driving with your nerve and the gut feeling that you can do something. I think Curtis Turner was very instrumental in that kind a situation also. We proved and showed that you can do various things with cars. Once you&#x27;ve seen it done, you know it can be done, and you&#x27;ll try it if you&#x27;re a race driver. I think a lot of these things was instrumental in pushing a lot of people forward in racing. I think myself, I came from nowhere and come to where I&#x27;m at today, and it&#x27;s basically living proof that if you try hard enough and work long enough, you can succeed in this sport. And I think it&#x27;s been instrumental in a whole lot of race teams, that they didn&#x27;t give up and quit because they had living proof that it could be done.  PETE DANIEL: Well, before we leave your racing career, do you want to just add anything about, any more thoughts that you have about racing, because I want to move on and talk about why you retired and how got into running a team.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  JUNIOR JOHNSON: We basically tried to run a racing team that our sponsors would be proud of us—they&#x27;d be proud to be associated with us—and do what the fans come to see. Put on a good show and go home and feel like we&#x27;ve done a good job for the fans. Cause the fans is what makes or breaks us. If it wasn&#x27;t for them coming out, going to the races, it wouldn&#x27;t be no use for the big sponsors to be here. They&#x27;d have nothing to present, or we wouldn&#x27;t have nothing to present to &#x27;em if it wasn&#x27;t for the fans coming out. So I just think our racing is going a long, long ways from where it is right now. It&#x27;s a good opportunity for young engineers to get involved in it because it&#x27;s a highly skillful, high paying position to be connected with the right kind a racing team.  PETE DANIEL: Well, you retired at what would be a relatively young age for a driver. You want to explain that a little bit.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, the biggest reason I retired when I did, I&#x27;d won all the super speedways that we had on our circuit at the time that I retired. And I&#x27;d won all the other, you know, basically half mile and mile race tracks that we had. For me to keep racing when I&#x27;d win another race, I was duplicating what I&#x27;d already done, and it wasn&#x27;t long &#x27;til I lost interest in it. And I had a real good opportunity to get off in the car owner field of the thing and make much, much more money doing that than I was driving. So when that opportunity came along, and already having won most all the races that I could win, I felt like, and I still feel that way, that I made a good decision by retiring. I had never got hurt up in a car to the extent that I was broke up and banged up, and I had accomplished what I set out to accomplish in it. I took that as success and went into another field of it. I&#x27;m glad I did. I was young when I quit but I still don&#x27;t have no regrets.  PETE DANIEL: How old were you, just for the record?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Thirty-four years old.  PETE DANIEL: Well, part of what y&#x27;all learned was that safety was very important. And of course, NASCAR has a record, probably the best record in the world, for having safe cars. Did you encourage that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, our team has been one of the most contributive, innovating team to the sport. We basically have been big innovators of a lot of the safety equipment that we have out here today. We still continue to work on safety. That&#x27;s one reason, I think, we&#x27;ve been lucky, and we&#x27;ve never had a driver hurt in one of our cars. We&#x27;re proud of that, cause I don&#x27;t reckon anything can hurt a race team worse than having one of its drivers to get banged up or hurt up in a race car.  PETE DANIEL: Can you just tell some of the things that you did to help safety?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: The fuel cell that we have today is a big factor. We had a big hand in that. Our brakes that we have today, we basically helped design and build them. The wheels we have today were basically part of our influence in the sport. What we call safety hubs and stuff is, we totally invented that stuff. It&#x27;s what we call a full floating hub. You can break an axle and the wheel won&#x27;t come off. The real heavy, beefed up suspension is, basically, a lot of that come from us. The roll cage, safety belts and stuff, we was a big part of developing that. The cars don&#x27;t have hardly anything on &#x27;em that we weren&#x27;t a part of innovating. We either did it or had a big hand in it.  PETE DANIEL: Did they even have seat belts when you were driving?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Not when I first started. But it wasn&#x27;t long until we had seat belts plus shoulder harnesses. And we was the first to ever run shoulder harness.  PETE DANIEL: Well, when you started off as a car builder, were you in partnership with somebody or was this your iniative? Could you explain how you got into that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I always built my own cars and raced them. When I was running for Holly Farms, basically owning my own car. Every once in a while I would quit building cars and go drive for somebody else because I had things that would interfere with me building cars. I was still driving then but I still liked to build my own car. So I finally quit driving and when I quit driving, I started building my own cars, and I&#x27;ve been able to do that ever since.  PETE DANIEL: Could you list who has driven for you over the years?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I&#x27;ve had Darryl Derringer, Bobby Isaac, Custis Turner drove some for me, Fireball Roberts, A. J. Foyt drove some for me, Gordon Johncock, Mario Andretti drove some races for me, Lloyd Ruby, Indianapolis Guy. I&#x27;ve had such drivers as David Pearson drove some for me. Leroy Yarbourgh, Cale Yarbourgh, Darryl Waltrip, and let&#x27;s see, Terry Labonte drives for me now. They&#x27;s some other drivers has drove for me but, right off hand, some of them kind a slips me.  PETE DANIEL: I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a good question to say which one of those was the best?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I wouldn&#x27;t turn my hand for the driving ability between about three or four drivers in stock cars. I know there&#x27;s better at Indianapolis cars than these boys are. But Cale Yarborough, Darryl Derringer, I mean Darryl Waltrip, Bobby Allison, and Leroy Yarborough are four people, I think one of them is just as good as the other.  PETE DANIEL: Did Mario win any for you when he was driving for you?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: No, Mario run second for me. Mario did a good job for us, and he only run in between races. Like if we was gonna run Daytona Beach in February, we would run two cars and Mario would drive one of them. Of course, our other driver would drive the other one. We&#x27;d only do that at Riverside and different places.  PETE DANIEL: I was thinking when I was writing these questions, is there a point where the speed of a car gets to be the enemy instead of the friend of the driver? Do you get to a point where speed is just too much, or is that what you&#x27;re always looking for more of?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re always looking for more of. I think it gets to where it&#x27;s too much for some drivers. I think the one driver here at our race track today that could handle any kind a speed without getting into trouble, and it&#x27;s Dale Earnhart. Bill Elliot is a very good speed driver, and he handles speed very well also. But I think it can get to a point where it would overtake Bill Elliot. I don&#x27;t think speed is ever going to take Dale Earnhart.  PETE DANIEL: I want to go back to building cars and engines. There&#x27;s a lot of stories told about how a team manager, a mechanic, can cheat a little bit and get an edge on somebody else, and sometimes that would be incorporated because it was such a good idea, later when it was found out or whatever. Do you know of any particularly good stories about how you make things go faster and not get caught in it?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d call it cheating or not. I guess you could. The way the rules read and the way they&#x27;re interpreted, sometimes you have a very, very broad span to work in. And a lot of times the first person that thinks of anything, or the first person that comes up with the best fast track, is the one they call cheating. We have a rule book to go by, and we take that as far as we can stretch it. And a lot of times that could be cheating determined on who interpreted the rule. It&#x27;s very rarely now that you see a guy who&#x27;ll go out and build a big motor, we&#x27;ll say. That is outright cheating. Or, he&#x27;ll go out and make his car too wide, or off-set his car, run it too low to the ground, run with wide wheels, and all kinds of stuff like that. That&#x27;s out and outright cheating. But what we do and what we&#x27;ve been accused of, ever since I&#x27;ve been building my own cars, is cheating. And when you cheat them ways that I mentioned, you are cheating. We stay away from that. What we do do, if NASCAR says you can run the car twenty-six inches off the ground, that&#x27;s counting on the lowside, we run it twenty-six inches. A lot of people can&#x27;t run them twenty-six inches, run twenty-six and a half, twenty-seven. They don&#x27;t build their cars where they take advantage of the rule book, and for that reason, they wind up getting hurt. Not only that, they get to believing that everybody&#x27;s cheating cause they&#x27;re getting beat.  PETE DANIEL: [Laughter] Yeah.   JUNIOR JOHNSON: Now there&#x27;s a thousand ways you can cheat, especially in the motor area, carburation, cylinder heads, manifolds. You know, black and white can be interpreted a lot of ways. We could take an aluminum manifold and make it look exactly like the one that everybody races out here, on the outside. That&#x27;s what they look at. But on the inside you can&#x27;t see it, so you know, it could be many, many ways, shape, forms, whatever, inside. That&#x27;s part of the terminologies of cheating cause they think it&#x27;s something wrong if you beat &#x27;em. And if they can&#x27;t see in there, they feel like you got to be cheating.  PETE DANIEL: How do you organize your life around racing? You pretty much into it all the time, every week, all season long? How do you organize your week, say, like this week?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, we prepare for races in advance. Like this past week we was ready to come to Dover before we ever went to Charlotte. And we prepared as if we was going to wreck and destroy our car at Charlotte. So when we got home from Charlotte, we&#x27;s ready to go to Dover. So we&#x27;ve prepared for Riverside, California. And when we go home from here, we&#x27;ll be at home on Monday and Tuesday, and we&#x27;ll be preparing a car for Pocono, Pennsylvania, while we&#x27;re there. Then we&#x27;ll leave for Riverside, California, on a Wednesday.  PETE DANIEL: Does this truck carry the car?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: We have two of these trucks. One of them, while we&#x27;re in California, will be loaded out and ready to go to Pocono when we get back. So all a driver will have to do is get out of the other truck and get in this truck and head for Pocono, Pennsylvania.  PETE DANIEL: Do you have a hands-on relationship with your shop? Do you go in and personally inspect the engines and look over the suspenion?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I go over their stuff pretty often. And I do have a hands-on relationship with everything that goes on in my shop. I hate to send the racing team off to the racing track, and it failed and me not know why it failed. If I know why it failed, I know what kind a shape it went there, I accept it. If I don&#x27;t know why they failed and didn&#x27;t have nothing to do with preparations of going to the race track, then it&#x27;s disturbing to me to stand back and see something that either disintegrated or destroyed itself, and the first time I seen it was after it happened at the race track.  PETE DANIEL: That sounds like a pretty high pressure life. What do you do to relax?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, you don&#x27;t. With the schedule we have today, you don&#x27;t relax. If you do, somebody will beat you. We have twenty-five good racing teams here that can produce winning race teams that&#x27;s basically about as good as ours. Lot of &#x27;em here has four or five people that&#x27;s worked for me on their crews. So they know basically how to organize the structure to prepare and be ready for about anything that comes along.  PETE DANIEL: Do you personally have any hobbies or do anything to get away from it all?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Basically, the only thing, the only hobby that I have is I do like to—I grew up in, you know, kind a at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains���and I like to coon hunt. I do have a bunch of coon dogs. When I can get away from the shop, six or seven o&#x27;clock at night and go to the house and eat supper, I do load my dogs up and go a coon hunting on every occasion I can break loose and get away.  PETE DANIEL: How big an operation do you have as far as employees?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, we have forty-three men that work in the shop. You know, do the racing stuff. Our staff consists of five secretaries, and bookkeepers. So you know we&#x27;ve got like forty-eight people working full-time.  PETE DANIEL: Do you do work for other racing teams too?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I do build some motors for other racing teams but that&#x27;s about the extent of it. Most all of them work just on our stuff and make parts and produce parts just for our race team.  PETE DANIEL: What&#x27;s your relationship with the various sponsors that have supported you through the years?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: We have a very good relationship with anybody that&#x27;s ever sponsored us. It is such a relationship that some of the sponsors has come back and sponsored us as many as three times. You know, like they&#x27;ll get in for two or three years and some reason, hard times or a change of managements or something another, will dictate them to get out of racing. Then four or five years from then, they&#x27;ll come back and want to do it again. So we have had sponsors that has raced with us over a period as much as three different times. This is a second time that we&#x27;ve had the Budweiser-Anhauser Busch people out of St. Louis sponsoring our cars. So, you know, we&#x27;re sponsor conscious. They come first in whatever we do.  PETE DANIEL: Do you ever get any offers personally to do appearances and all? I never see you personally appearing.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I do personal appearance stuff for our sponsors, and that&#x27;s the extent of it. I don&#x27;t go out and do stuff like most of the race drivers do, which is, they&#x27;ll go with car dealerships and stuff of that nature. I don&#x27;t do that kind a stuff, no. What I do is if Budweiser or Baby Ruth candybars or Banquet frozen foods have a convention or something in some city like Chicago or somewhere, I will go to them things and represent them because that&#x27;s part of our relationship.  PETE DANIEL: You don&#x27;t do things like television advertisements like you see Mario Andretti or Richard Petty or somebody like that? I&#x27;ve never seen you do anything like that.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: No.  PETE DANIEL: That&#x27;s just a choice you made not to do it?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I think it&#x27;s better for our driver to do most of our TV stuff. He is a person that&#x27;s out in front of the public. He is a person that we rely on to basically present our product and our race team out in the marketplace and stuff of that nature. Management-wise, I think I&#x27;m better qualified for that for a company than our drivers are.  PETE DANIEL: Do you have much trouble with curiosity seekers, people pestering you, or do you pretty much know how to not be bothered too much with that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I do have a lot of that but I don&#x27;t have no problem with it. It comes with the sport, and it&#x27;s part of what we need to keep in contact.  PETE DANIEL: Say tomorrow, you&#x27;ll be directing the team during the race, and you stand there in the pit and look out on the track, like they&#x27;re running around now, do you look at your car, do you hear what other cars are doing? How do you gauge that? What are you talking to your driver about? What are you thinking about?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, we&#x27;re discussing what we need to do to our car to make it better for him. We&#x27;re constantly working with whatever combination that we need to be working with to help him—tire stagger, air pressure in the tires, and all kinds of stuff. We also monitor most of the other race teams&#x27; radios, and we pick up their conversation and stuff. We know if they&#x27;re in good shape or bad shape, or what their troubles is, right along with ours. So we pretty well have a handle on, we know the race and the operation of everybody else, the same as we do ours.  PETE DANIEL: So somebody is telling you what the other drivers are talking about too?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Right.  PETE DANIEL: Who else among the team managers here would you rate real high?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I would rate Richard Childress&#x27;s team pretty high. Richard&#x27;s a very good manager. He&#x27;s very knowledgable. I would also rate Bill Elliot&#x27;s crew—they&#x27;re a very knowledgable team, of what&#x27;s going on. Harry Hyde has a lot of knowledge of what racing&#x27;s all about. We do have some younger teams here that have young crew chiefs and stuff that are doing a good job, but I think it&#x27;s a temporary good job. I think that good management will be around a long time. I think they&#x27;ll swap teams and go other places. And keep working at it til they become a professional in the management field of it, and then you&#x27;ll see them stay with just one certain team for a long, long time.  PETE DANIEL: Do you want to elaborate anymore on the ownership?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, nothing except, I think that guys that are interested in owning a race car and running a racing team should take a look at not waiting until you&#x27;ve wore yourself out as a race driver, and you&#x27;re not able to get off in the field of owning the cars and stuff. You&#x27;ve got, like from forty-five, fifty year old til, you know, and you sure ain&#x27;t gonna be able to do that kind of stuff when you&#x27;re getting to be sixty year old. I think you need to do it in your early forties, and you&#x27;ll be successful at it for maybe twenty or twenty-five years. I think once you get fifty-five years old, you&#x27;re not going to be successful at it at all because you&#x27;re basically a person then that&#x27;s looking for retirement or a easy way to live or something. Racing&#x27;s too tough to think that you can wait that long and be successful at it—owning a team and running it for long time.  PETE DANIEL: Well, let&#x27;s move on and talk a little bit more about your personal life if you don&#x27;t mind. Like, could you just tell me when you got married? How are met your wife and a little bit of that?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, my wife is basically a young sweetheart from, you know, fourteen years old. We knew each other all of our lives, and we grew up together. We dated and run around together and went to the race tracks. Like when I was growing up and driving at local races Saturday night, Hickory was about thirty mile away, and we&#x27;d go to the races and back on Saturday night. I basically growed up with my wife. She&#x27;s not only been my sweetheart, she&#x27;s been my friend. She&#x27;s a big part of what I&#x27;ve accomplished—without her I don&#x27;t think I could accomplish nothing.  PETE DANIEL: Did she help you manage any or do any of the work?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: She has a lot to do with our managing of our race team and our business. We&#x27;re in the poultry business. We have a very large herd of cattle, and we have 178,000 chickens that we grow for Holly Farms. We have other interests besides just racing so she looks after a lot of that stuff. She kind a takes care of our, you might say, home life, more so than I do because I make major decisions and I do major things overall, but we have guys that looks after the farm and runs that part of our business just like the ones that run our racing office.  PETE DANIEL: I was going to ask you about that anyway. What other kinds of business interests you have? You say you have poultry and cattle.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: We&#x27;ve been in, both of us is first a farmer. Then I got into racing, and it&#x27;s been part of both our survival. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be happy without our farm. It&#x27;s what we growed up with, what both of us like to do. Racing&#x27;s been good to us. You know, we don&#x27;t want to be, if somebody says, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve got what we want out of racing. We gonna take it and go.&quot; We&#x27;re not gonna do that. We&#x27;ve got a lot out of racing, and we want to give part of it back.  PETE DANIEL: Well, when you grew up in Wilkes County, it must have been one thing, and when you go back to it now, it must have changed a whole lot. Could you elaborate just on how life has changed in those years since you grew up there?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, when I was growing up a boy in Wilkes County, the roads basically was all dirt. We didn&#x27;t have no real good roads. Nobody much had a car. You walked about ninety percent of the places that you went. Nobody didn&#x27;t have no money either. If they weren&#x27;t fooling with whiskey, like I said before, or selling some of the products it took to make moonshine, they didn&#x27;t have no money much. So as Wilkes County has progressed and come along, the moonshine businese kind a died out. There&#x27;s a company come in there, name of Holly Farms, that started a tremendous poultry industry from scratch. A little company that kept growing and growing and growing. Most everybody in Wilkes County started growing chickens for this poultry business, and it&#x27;s been the life saver of our county, Wilkes County. It and a company called Lowes Hardware has produced jobs, facilities, and stuff for people that made a tremendous change in our economy of the county. I think now it&#x27;s one of the greatest counties that we have in North Carolina. We certainly have the greenest, best farming, fertilization type situation with the poultry business there of anybody I know of.  PETE DANIEL: I was gonna ask you a question about politics. How do you describe yourself politically?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I&#x27;m basically a Democrat. I always will be a Democrat because my whole family, father, grandfather, and all of &#x27;em, has always been Democrats. I guess in North Carolina if you&#x27;re a Democrat, you die a Democrat. Ninety-nine percent of the people that I know are either one way or the other, and they stay that way. We have had a mix in politics where the Republican situations have created a change, let&#x27;s say, from Democrat to Republican, but not very often. I like people on both sides. I don&#x27;t vote a Republican ticket. But I&#x27;ve got good friends in Democrats and Republicans. As an individual, I don&#x27;t want nary one of them mad at me from the standpoint of, will you help me or do me a favor or would you do this and that? I have helped the Democrat party a lot. I contribute to it a lot.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  PETE DANIEL: If you hadn&#x27;t become a race driver, what other kind of career do you think you would have pursued?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I was going after a baseball career. I think that&#x27;s what all people in my area at the time, that was the top sport of everybody round where I lived. It was either a baseball player, if you made a lot of money, you have to go away from there to make any money. And I was pursuing a baseball career. I think I would have been very, very good at playing baseball. I was a pitcher, a left handed pitcher. I had put, from about ten years old to about fourteen years old, I put four years in an effort of being a major league baseball player. And I was advanced at the time I was on the farm and turned a farm tractor over and broke my arm, but prior to that I had advanced to where I was playing ball with people four and five years older than I was because I was as good at fourteen as they was at eighteen. And I think I would have made it. Not just because I was that much better than everybody else, but because I had tried that much harder. I had put four years in learning how to throw a ball, learning how to control, learning how to make good pitches, curve balls, sliders, and stuff of that nature. I had a professional baseball player helping me at a very young age. He was one that had already been in the major leagues, and he knew what it took, and he was teaching me major league ball when I was twelve, thirteen years old.  PETE DANIEL: Who was he?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Frank Johnson, played with the Philadelphia Phillies. He hurt his arm, and of course, he kind of fell out of basball after that. He still knew the fundamentals of baseball. He knew how to pitch and what balls that you had to have. You had to have the fast ball, curve ball, you know, hit the spots you were supposed to hit and stuff. He taught be a lot of that stuff. I worked very, very hard to try to make sure when I got an opportunity I was good enough to present, you know, something that I could make money from. But then I broke my arm, turned the farm tractor over and broke my arm. From that point on I never could throw a baseball. I could throw it okay but it hurt so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it. So I gave it up. Course, at that particular time, I was fourteen. I was trying to, you know, get into the booze business because that was the only thing going on around us. I was learning how to drive fast cars already at that time. And it just came natural that I kind a, I hurt my arm and I said, &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t do this anymore, so I&#x27;ll go do this.&quot; First thing you know I was in the racing business. Plumb forgot about baseball cause I was at a loss for what it took to play baseball.  PETE DANIEL: What teams were you playing on? What kind of teams were there around to play with?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: There were some good Triple A ball playing teams around in my area that we had back then. They would form a, you know, sort of county teams. Local business people would get up teams to play other teams and stuff. We had a lot of baseball teams, you know, just kind a country ball teams. A lot of the players that I played with or against went on to play, like I say, class A ball and some went to the majors.  PETE DANIEL: That&#x27;s another example of your having a kind of exceptional confidence in your abilities that you could, almost like you always knew that you were going to do something to sort of get away from Wilkes County or be, if not famous, at least be very good at something.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I&#x27;m a strong believer if you try hard enough and work hard enough that you can see defeat is just unheard of to me. I have a lot of boys that work for me. There&#x27;s just certain things that I tell them to do. They say, &quot;It can&#x27;t be done.&quot; It can be done if you work hard enough, put enough effort into it, it can be accomplished. Maybe not what you want to accomplish but in that field you&#x27;ll find a place that you can accomplish what you&#x27;re trying to do.  PETE DANIEL: Where do you think you got that confidence? You just always have it or somebody teach it to you?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: I think I got it from my father. My father was undefeatable in anything he went after. If it was building a tool shed, a barn, whatever, he always accomplished what he set out to do.  PETE DANIEL: But a lot of people don&#x27;t have that confidence. It&#x27;s interesting to see that you had a little bit of an edge on your brothers, and you that came from a background that wouldn&#x27;t suggest that you were going to end up as a famous race driver and all that. It&#x27;s just a remarkable kind of thing. You have something, a gift of some kind that not everybody gets.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I think I do, and I have had and still have, and I&#x27;m tickled to death that I do have. Cause I still work with my brothers on the farm, doing various things, and they haven&#x27;t, over the years I can remember doing things with them. Their attitude towards the basics of whatever they do has not changed. I mean, if things are too hard to do, sit down and say, &quot;Looks like it&#x27;s not worth it to me.&quot; But if it&#x27;s worth doing, it&#x27;s worth doing right. It&#x27;s worth taking the time to make sure that you&#x27;re satisfied that it&#x27;s the way that you want it to be. Not substituting or not give in to the idea that it&#x27;s too hard to do, or it ain&#x27;t worth working on. That&#x27;s defeat to me, and I don&#x27;t like it.  PETE DANIEL: [Laughter] One last kind of question is about the way of life here. For  most people, anybody who&#x27;s going to be studying racing today, you sit here at a track and you have a way of life. What kind of people are attracted to this? Are the people, do they come from rich families, or middle class families, or poor families? Do they stick with this for a long time? What kind of a way of life is it from your point of view?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, it&#x27;s not the rich people that come to our sport and stay. The rich people that comes to our sport most of the time has a belief that I got money, and I can buy success, and that&#x27;s not true. You&#x27;ve got to earn success in our sport. And that&#x27;s the people that stays. One that&#x27;s willing to give enough to make sure that they&#x27;re successful. Money don&#x27;t have a whole lot to do with it to start with. Certainly when you get in a position to where you&#x27;ve paid your dues, you want to make money out of it. But that&#x27;s a long time down the road. You got to be willing to stick with it until payday comes.  PETE DANIEL: This is sort of like a circus or something. You come here and set up. You know, you come up for the week-end, and then you pack up your tent and your cars, and you go on to the next place. Is it a hard life?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: It&#x27;s a very hard life. You&#x27;re on the road a lot. You&#x27;re away from your family a lot. You extend your ability and physical ableness beyond what you believe you can do. And if you extend your energetic system twice what it&#x27;s capable, because your determination not to give up. It&#x27;s a very tough life. It&#x27;s basically, like you say, like a circus. You come here and you set up and do this. It is like a circus to a certain extent, setting up and getting ready to perform. But when the time comes to perform, the circuit that our stock cars, is physical ability to produce and give the strength and energy beyond any belief. A circus is a performance that you perfected. You do it because you&#x27;re good at it and you won&#x27;t extend yourself to the physical ability that you would be exhausted, or you couldn&#x27;t go no further and that type stuff. That&#x27;s the difference in the circus and what we do.  PETE DANIEL: Yeah. Well, I think that anybody who&#x27;s ever seen you drive or seen anybody drive would like to know what&#x27;s going through your mind when you&#x27;re out there competing. You&#x27;re out there behind the wheel, and you want to lead the race. What goes through your mind? Do you have any sense of speed or danger or thrill, or, what&#x27;s going through your mind?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: You never believe that it&#x27;s dangerous, and the reason I don&#x27;t think you ever believe it&#x27;s dangerous is simply because you&#x27;re controlling everything. You control the driving. You can either slow down or go however fast you want to. And I think that sense of being in control, don&#x27;t never cause you to be ascared or fear for your life or whatever you want to say. I think, in answer to your question about what makes you have that drive, is the competition. You want to prove to the other guy you&#x27;re better than he is. It don&#x27;t make no difference how much nerve he&#x27;s got, or how hard he drives, or whatever he does, you still, if you are a determined race driver, you gonna try to prove to him that you&#x27;re better than he is. And you&#x27;ll wind up doing that if you work at it hard enough.  PETE DANIEL: It&#x27;s competition like any athlete, thinking about, I can do this better than the next person.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That&#x27;s exactly true, and you&#x27;ll perform better under pressure than you will any other time.  PETE DANIEL: Do you remember any times in your career where you could elaborate, where maybe somebody was pushing you real hard, and you got the best of them because you pushed back harder?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, when I won the Daytona 500 in 1960 at Daytona, I was the underdog. Like, if you was betting on something today, it&#x27;d be a 100 to 1. Because the car I had weren&#x27;t capable of winning. The situation I was in, it was unbelievable that you could take a car like I had and win the race. But during the last week of practice at Daytona, like three or four days before the race, I was out playing around on the race track with Joe Weatherly and Jack Smith and Cotton Owens and some old racers that I raced against. And I picked up and sensed that if I got behind the other cars that was faster than I was and stayed as close to &#x27;em as I could, that I could run as fast as they could run. But yet I was like 50 horsepower under horsepowered, 20 miles an hour slower than they was by ourselves. But when I could get in there close to &#x27;em and hang in there, I was just as fast as they was. So they didn&#x27;t have nothing on me. And when the race started, that&#x27;s what I started doing. Well, the 500 mile race was two-thirds over with before everybody figured out what I was doing. How&#x27;s he taking this car that&#x27;s not even competitive, and he&#x27;s still here with us, and he&#x27;s still, you know, I had led the race right smart because the other cars were faster than I was and was tearing tires up and stuff. But I was using them to pull me along. When they finally figured it out, most of them had done blowed their cars up trying to out run me, and they was only a couple of &#x27;em left. And it come down to the end, just me and them, and one of them was trying to get away from me when he wrecked his car and lost it and just basically left me sitting there by myself. But I had used up all the competition to get me where I was at.  PETE DANIEL: That&#x27;s amazing. So that&#x27;s when drafting first started?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: That was when drafting first started.  PETE DANIEL: What kind of car did you have at that time?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: A &#x27;59 Chevolet. And I was running against the factory Pontiacs, and they had, you know, souped up motors and everything back then that they had produced from the factory Pontiacs. My car wasn&#x27;t supposed to even be in ten laps of them.  PETE DANIEL: Yeah, that&#x27;s a good example of, you just felt that when you were out there fooling around with these guys.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Playing around with them, yeah.  PETE DANIEL: Did y&#x27;all do a lot of that before races in those days? Were you free to go out and just race a little bit and get a little…  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Get a feel of how your car felt and everything when you was around other cars. And then later on, &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s go out and draft a little bit.&quot; Well, before then it&#x27;s, &quot;Let&#x27;s go out and run together and see how our cars run.&quot;  PETE DANIEL: Do the cars draft as much now at the speeds they go?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Oh, now, all cars are so fast that there ain&#x27;t no drafting to it. Your car is running right behind the car in front of you, running wide open. You can pull out and run wide open by yourself just as good as you can running behind them. But what they did, we took the aerodynamics of cars and made them so streamlined that they&#x27;s not a slip stream there to follow along.  PETE DANIEL: So the air closes back down behind them.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yeah, yeah, like an airplane, you know. It just sheds off from them and there ain&#x27;t nothing there for you to follow.  PETE DANIEL: Well, are they, when you see the camera they put in cars, it looks like they&#x27;re almost skating. I mean, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not but they look awfully light.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: They are light, very light. That&#x27;s what them spoilers are on the back, to make sure that the, you know, keep driving it back down to the ground and it don&#x27;t get loose.  PETE DANIEL: I think most people don&#x27;t realize that these are race cars as much as they are. I&#x27;ve heard people say, &quot;Well, what&#x27;s the interest in looking at stock cars racing.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, they&#x27;re not exactly stock cars.&quot; [Laughter]   JUNIOR JOHNSON: No.  PETE DANIEL: Could you just tell a little bit how much different these are from stock cars? I think that would be an interesting thing for people to learn.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, the sheet metal on these cars are basically stock, street sheet metal. Just like you could go down to a dealer and if you bent a fender, you could buy a fender, and it&#x27;d be the same fender we&#x27;ve got. But we have what we call a rear spoiler on the deck lid that the air comes over the back glass and it hits that spoiler and it drives the back end to the ground. And on the front, we have a spoiler on the front of it which is a cup spoiler. It kind a pooches out in front of the car. Air comes in and hits that and goes up over the hood and drives the nose in the ground. So them two things make that car stay on the ground, in the front and in the back. In a straight line, you could easily run them cars 250, 300 mile an hour, and they drive good. The only place that we don&#x27;t have spoilers to really put pressure on them is when you go into a curve sideways. There&#x27;s nothing there to keep it from sliding sideways except the tires. But in a straight run, them spoilers just nail it to the ground.  PETE DANIEL: Have you ever studied ground effect?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yes, we do that all the time. We&#x27;ll spend a month out of, probably one month out of the year in the wind tunnel with ground effects study.  PETE DANIEL: I talked to Tony Rudd who worked for Lotus cars. He and, I think, Peter Wright were the ones that Colin Chapman gave that assignment to. He was telling me about some of the problems they ran into getting that formula one car, that Mario Andretti won the world championship in, developed. It&#x27;s an interesting idea that he came up with.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: It&#x27;s an interesting formula. But sometimes what&#x27;s so intriging about air is that you never know what air&#x27;s going to do. You have to try it, and you can formulate what you think it&#x27;s going to do but you still have to try it to see if it&#x27;s going to do it. Sometimes it won&#x27;t do it. It will either help it in one area and hurt it in another, or do something that you&#x27;re not expecting it to do.  PETE DANIEL: So where do you have a wind tunnel?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: We&#x27;ve used the Detroit General Motors&#x27; wind tunnel all the time.  PETE DANIEL: Do they have one with a movable bottom to it?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: They can put it in yaw or, you know, twist it anyway you want to twist it.  PETE DANIEL: Well, I&#x27;m about out of questions, but we could go on if you wanted to.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, I think you&#x27;ve covered about everything that I can think of like right now. We&#x27;ll just say when you get back and you set down and start going over your stuff and all, and you come up with a question you want to know something about, just call me at the shop on the phone and I&#x27;ll, you know, get back with you. That way you won&#x27;t have to come down to my shop or meet me somewhere or another to get, you know, your questions answered. I can just do it over the phone.  PETE DANIEL: Well, this has been really informative to me. I want to make sure that we have a record. This goes to this Notable North Carolinian Collection in Chapel Hill like I wrote you. What it is is people will be able to learn from this. As historians they&#x27;ll come in and be able to consult it.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: What you should do, probably is, would help you some, is kind a walk around and talk to some of the people.  PETE DANIEL: Some of your people here?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yeah, or some of the other race teams.  PETE DANIEL: Well, I may have to interview some more North Carolina drivers. This is the first one. This is for part of this, I guess they&#x27;d interviewed bankers and politicians and realized that there were people who were Notable North Carolinians that didn&#x27;t come from that background at all.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Yeah.  PETE DANIEL: So it may turn out that we do some more of these so I may just come around to do interviews. There&#x27;s one question that this friend of mine suggested that I ask you, and I ought to do it. He&#x27;s from Sparta, North Carolina, named Jim Kelly. He&#x27;s Curious, what your reaction was to Tom Wolfe when he interviewed you for that piece he did.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Well, you&#x27;d almost have to know Tom Wolfe to get anybody&#x27;s feeling about him. Tom Wolfe is a very unique type individual from the standpoint of—his beliefs about things are not normal people&#x27;s way of looking at something or thinking or writing about it. He acts a lot like a person to me that can see beyond anybody else. And I kind a sensed that in him right away when he came to me and wanted to do the article and stuff like that. But I also sensed that if I didn&#x27;t let him do the article, and go out and research and find his own material to do the article, that he was going to do the article like I wanted him to do it—leave the bad out, put the good in, cover up a lot of stuff. And I told him, I said, &quot;Tom, I&#x27;ll help you with anything that I can help you with. But I&#x27;m not going to help you with that story. You&#x27;re going to have to go out and get that yourself.&quot; I said, &quot;You go get it from the people. Let them tell you what they think about Junior Johnson.&quot; You know, if they say he&#x27;s a sorry, no good scamp, that&#x27;s fine with me. That&#x27;s their opinion. But I want you to do it that way. Don&#x27;t ask me to help you write your story. I&#x27;m not going to do it. And that&#x27;s what he did, and it took him about eighteen months.  PETE DANIEL: Really?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: To do that story. He would come and work on it a while and he&#x27;d leave and he&#x27;d come back. He did that and it&#x27;s about eighteen months he worked on it.  PETE DANIEL: Did he talk to you a lot?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Quite a bit, but I particularly watched that I didn&#x27;t influence him. I didn&#x27;t want to influence him.  PETE DANIEL: Yeah, you just gave him information. You didn&#x27;t color it in anyway.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Facts, I gave him facts. That&#x27;s all I would give him. If he asked me, he says, &quot;Well, you know, has your Daddy been in the pen or prison? Have you been in prison?&quot; and stuff. I said, &quot;Yeah, I was in prison in 1957.&quot; Told him, you know, where I went, how long I was there, and what it was for. Then, you know, sometimes he would ask me, say, &quot;Well, what&#x27;d you think about going to prison?&quot; I didn&#x27;t want to tell him, you know, that probably prison was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It taught me a lot of things. It taught me discipline. You learned to live with your fellow man and get along with him, and you&#x27;re not the only thing there are on earth. There&#x27;s somebody else bigger than you are. You will do what you&#x27;re told. And if you don&#x27;t want to live a life like this, you can change it. First things, I think if, I don&#x27;t say that you need to go out here and do something to get in prison to learn what you need to do. But if you go in there and take what you learn in there and come out and live with that for the rest of your life, it might be the best thing that ever happened to you.  PETE DANIEL: That&#x27;s an interesting intrepretation of it.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Cause I truly think that my life was directed in another direction, and it&#x27;s been an asset to me all the time that I have been associated with people and made decisions and see people—you know, fly off the handle and stuff like that. It&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s a waste of frustration that don&#x27;t accomplish nothing.  PETE DANIEL: Do you want to elaborate anymore on that? I didn&#x27;t bring it up simply because I&#x27;d rather for you to bring it up.  JUNIOR JOHNSON: No, it was part of my life. It&#x27;s a part I&#x27;m not ashamed of. If people says, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#x27;t want nobody to know I went to prison.&quot; I&#x27;m a not ashamed that I went to prison. In fact, if everybody got out of going to prison what I got out of it, it might be good for them. Because when I went to prison, I was a pretty well hardheaded, set type individual. When I came out of prison, I weren&#x27;t that way, and I never have been since. And I learnt that in there. I learnt that it didn&#x27;t make no difference who you are or where you come from. You did take orders. You did do what you were supposed to. And you lived by their rules and not your own or you paid, paid dearly. It&#x27;s how much you wanted to suffer is how much you fought them.  PETE DANIEL: So that kind of directed your energy. You learned how to control your energy and direct your resources in a more positive way, you think?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Positive is probably not the proper thought. You learn to concentrate before you open your mouth. And I still do it today from being in confinement and being proper discipline, you know. Made do what I was supposed to do. It was a lot of times it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to do but I learnt you accepted that as a way of life. They didn&#x27;t ask for you to come here. You made that choice of screwing up or doing whatever you done, that you got here. You had to accept the fact that you did wrong and you was paying for it, and the quicker you could pay for it and get out and do what was right, the better off you was. I ain&#x27;t forgot that nor never will forget it.  PETE DANIEL: How old were you then?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Twenty, well, it was in &#x27;57. I was born in &#x27;31. Twenty-seven. Right in the prime of my racing career, really.  PETE DANIEL: Yeah, you were just getting…  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Really getting into it.  PETE DANIEL: … getting famous and all that, winning a lot. Did y&#x27;all listen to music when y&#x27;all were growing up? Did music have any influence on your life?  JUNIOR JOHNSON: Not basically, we did listen, you know, like I told you awhile ago, the Grand Old Opery was something that you had to listen to on Saturday night. And people like Bill Monroe, Charlie Monroe, and Lester Flat and Earl Scruggs and all these people were your folk heroes back in my growing up days.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>-1- BEJ Senator Sam Ervin 3-24-81__________ VA^yf ^ /i .$ tK-.jf.near  Swepsonville.  He said, &quot;Where&#x27;s Swepsonville. &quot; He says, &quot;Not very far from Altamahaw.&quot;  Oh Yeah, he had a sense of humor.  He liked people and people liked him.  He was a wonderful person. Everett&#x27;s father, as I understand was..studied law, and was licensed to practice law, and practised law for a little while then felt he was called on to preach, and abandoned the law for the ministry. He was a very fine preacher; very eloquent.  He preached here for four years; like most Methodist ministers, -they move^on.  That was the First Methodist Church of Morganton, which is still in existence up here. No, I&#x27;m not a member there, I&#x27;m a Presbyterian.  Everett was in the schools there - in the graded schools - Everett and myself was about the same age, as a matter of fact he was born on the 8th of September and I was born on the 27th; same year, same month.  I used to., his birthday came before mine you know; I used to take him a bottle of Scotch and say, &quot;Here&#x27;s a present for my venerable friend, (laughs heartily) of course after the 2 6th I couldn&#x27;t call him venerable friend because I was in the same category.  Everett always had a lot of fun in him, from the time he was here.  I knew all the family pretty well.  Henry was next to Everett, of course Charlie and Frank was so much younger than we were - I guess Everett must have been along about 16 and he had a baseball team up in the part of town he lived in, and I had one in the part I lived in, and we used to play baseball about two or three times a week, and both of us caught.  He caught and I caught on my team.  Henry was comparatively small at that time, Everett used to say..Henry was on his baseball team... Senator Sam Ervin                                 -2- Everett said he was the &quot;pigtail&quot; - he runs after the fowl balls, and brings them back.  He always had a great sense of humor from the time I first knew him; and was extremely popular with people. As you say  Everett loved people, and if a person loves people he usually finds his love reciprocated.  In fact he always does.  We wern&#x27;t in the same grade at school..! think I might have started a year ahead. Everett was more inclined to have fun than he was to study.  He was sometime a little mischevious.  We had a YMCA, and whoever was running it - one day he caught Everett and some more boys shooting craps which wasn&#x27;t supposed to be the customary occupation of a preacher&#x27;s son.  I don&#x27;t think his pa ever learned about it though.  His father was a very fine preacher.  Had a good deal of eloquence and a good deal of emotion in his preaching.  He was not, to any great degree, a &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; preacher, he had a tendency to preach on the kinder aspects of religion, like love and service to others and things like that, instead of trying to scare the devil out of people.  A very fine man. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to girls in those days, but I do remember I was very fond of both of his sisters, Margaret and Lucy.  Like Everett, Charlie had a great sense of humor too.  I had a daughter vgomans that wanted to go to/college at Duke University, and I told her, &quot;Leslie I don&#x27;t see how that can be, I&#x27;m president of the Carolina Alumni Association now, and I can&#x27;t explain to the satisfaction of the Carolina alumni how it happens that your brother is at Davidson instead they would excuse me for of Chapel Hill, and I just don&#x27;t believe theee-6-aRy-e*eHGe-#ee-me ~ &quot;plotters (?) having a daughter at Duke.  Well ......the Potters, and the Potters being women folk in my family I had to surrender.  So Leslie had very good grades, she had been to Peace College the last two years of high school, and she and one other person made the highest grades in the history of Peace College since it was founded around 18 50.  She had Senator Sam Ervin                                 -3- good grades, but I thought I ought to write Charlie a letter, he was then Vice President, I told him she wanted to go to woman&#x27;s college of Duke, and I would appreciate anything he could do to help her get in. I got a letter back, Charlie said, &quot;I&#x27;ll be glad to help your daughter get in.  All the Ervins I know have either been to Chapel Hill or Davidson College, and I&#x27;d like for one of them to get a real opportunity to get a real education, so I&#x27;ll help any way I can.  Charlie had a sense of humor, and he also had the Jordan courage.  I don&#x27;t know how many operations he had. Lucy lived in SC when she married a minister.  I don&#x27;t recall Everett&#x27;s mother at all.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the old parsonage here ha$ been torn away, because the church building has been torn away.  The church building was on what we called King Street, and it&#x27;s sometime called Church Street because it had the Methodist church, the Methodist parsonage, the Baptist parsonage and the Baptist church, and further up they had the Episcopal church.  King Street.  The original streets of Morganton were named after the streets of Charleston.  People traded at Charleston.  Drove the turkeys down there from Morganton. A long drive.  They used to tell me that they took tar along, and every evening they dipped the feet of the turkeys in the tar so they wouldn&#x27;t get so sore walking.  Morganton was a small town back in those days and I knew virtually everybody in town, and where the cats and dogs belonged.  That&#x27;s the kind of town it was.  It has always been a very friendly town. BB:  What kind of man was Everett Jordan? SE:  Well I would say that Everett was a deeply religious person.  I think that he went to church every Sunday, no matter where he was, and he was a very strong supporter of the church in general and the  Methodist church in particular, quite naturally.  Another fundemental trait of his, Senator Sam Ervin                                 -4- he loved people, and he was always very kind to people.  He would bring his great sense of humor into play on all kinds of occasions.  He was very charitable in his judgement of other people; even people that he didn&#x27;t like, he never had anything harmful to say about them, and never did anything to try to injure them.  He was also very loyal to his friends, certainly in politics, he was extremely loyal; would go the second mile with a friend.  I found that my service in the Senate with Everett was extremely pleasant because we had had this association that went back to when we were teenagers, and played baseball on the sandlots here, and we had associations politically from time to time through the years. Everett&#x27;s career and mine were quite different; I&#x27;d been in the law, concerned with legal questions, therefore I was much concerned with constitutional questions in the Senate, especially after I became chairman of the subcomittee on constitutional rights; Everett&#x27;s career, as you know was in the business and manufacturing.  He had experience that was quite different from mine, and I had experience in my profession that was quite different from his, so as a result of that, I think that in the Senate we complemented each other.  I was interested particularly in legal and constitutional questions; in the because not only I served on rights of individuals from a legal standpoint; Re*-eRy-di-ee&gt;ve-eR- the judicial committee and had to handle these things, but Everett was interested in what some people in Washington call &quot;The loaves and the fishes.&quot;  I always tried to help get things for NC, but Everett specialized in that.  He recognized NC&#x27;s great stake in agriculture and got a position on the Agricultural Committee just as soon as he could.  He looked after the farmer in general and the NC farmer in particular all the time he was in the Senate.  He was also interested in rivers and harbors and roads and highways and things like that, and to get just as much as money as he could for NC to help out in those things.  He also served on the Public Works Commission, and he did a Senator Sam Ervin                                 -5- magnificent job for the state in both of those things.  Both of which concerned the state very much, because we have so many rivers and harbors.  Anything he was interested in, he was very thorough, and so he got to be an expert on agricultural problems; with particular reference to problems in tobacco, peanuts, soybeans and all of those things that affected NC.  He also got to be an expert on rivers and harbors, so I relied implicitly on him in getting advice in those areas on how to vote, and he relied on me in areas that I worked in, so we complemented each other. I don&#x27;t remember any of the details on the two price cotton, except that he did a tremendous job.  I know he and I used to have some hard fights up there, when we had some of them like the Kennedys and Senator Williams (John) of Delaware, trying to get price supports for tobacco.  We had a many a fight.  Oh yes, we were able to get farm programs because we sort of teamed up with the people from the midwest and North Dakota; Milton Young, a Republican Senator from N. D. was a great ally of ours on those things...we sort of looked after them and they looked after us.  You have to work together to get anything.  That&#x27;s the reason that so many of these people that call themselves liberals don&#x27;t ever get anything done, because they want a whole loaf, their way, and if they can&#x27;t get a whole loaf they won&#x27;t take a half, and furthermore they won&#x27;t relinquish their views and cooperate with other people. I would say that Jesse Helms is extremely conservative.  On some things, too conservative for me, and I&#x27;m very fond of Jesse personally, I&#x27;ve known him a long time (he was very fond of Everett too).  I think that Jesse goes to these extremes - in other words - Jesse is not a lawyer, but I recognize as a lawyer that most of the value of the constitution of the US is that it is a short simple instrument, and I don&#x27;t favor adding many ammendments to it; like abortion, prohibiting Senator Sam Ervin                                 -6- abortion, things like that, because if everytime the Supreme Court makes a wrong decision, if we try to cure it by an ammendment the constitution will soon be as long as the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and be worthless.  I do not think that Jesse quite appreciates that. However, I do say for Jessie&#x27;s credit, he does have a trait that is in short supply among politicians, and that is the courage to stand up for what he believes whether he&#x27;s right or wrong; I think that&#x27;s his strength. BB:  How effective was Everett Jordan as a Senator? SE:  Very effective, especially in the fields in which he worked. One thing, was the principle, that he realized that legislation is the art of the possible, and the art of the compromise.  He was always willing to help somebody in return for help.  In other words if a person helped him on a proposition, he was always willing to support return the favor, and consequently he always had a good rapprt among the Senators.  He was also an awful good mixer, and on very friendly terms with virtually everybody in the Senate.  Somebody said, &quot;The Senate is the greatest club on earth&quot; and there&#x27;s a lot of truth in that.  As a result of his ability to mix with people, and also in the fields where he was knowldgable, they knew he had made a success in business and manufacturing and people listened to him, just as they will listen to any man who has experience.  Th Senators knew him personally, extremely well. I don&#x27;t recall any particular bill that originated with him, but Everett was fundamentally a cooperative fellow, and in the Agriculture Committee and the Public Works Comittee he assisted very much in forumlating many bills along with other members of the committee, and so he made a great contribution that way.  His/contribution was his ability to cooperate with other people, and in his quiet way, persuade Senator Sam Ervin                                 -7- them about the correctness of his views on the things in which he was particularly interested.  Most work in the Senate is done in committee. Woodrow Wilson said, &quot;Congress in committee is Congress at work.&quot; Everett was very effective in his committee work and his personal contacts with other members of the committee. I would say that as a general rule, Everett was opposed to excessive federal spending.  He told me, &quot;The trouble  with these folks up here they come in here with these big corporation bills and things,they never had to meet a payroll, they never had a note falling due at the bank, they don&#x27;t know what it is to have to meet these things.&quot; I would say that he was very sound economically, in other words he believed in pay as you go as far as you could do it in the climate that prevailed in the US at that time.  His judgement was pretty good. BB:  Why do you think he was defeated in the last election? SE:  Well I think this:  In the first place, lets see Everett was 72, and the trouble is when you get that age most of your old friends have gone aloft, and the ones that still remain, on account of their age, they can&#x27;t get out and work from sunrise to sunset to get voters to the poles.  Then in recent years you&#x27;ve had the younger people come along and anybody that had any age on them was somekind of doddering old idiot;and for some strange reason everybody that was, was born with wisdom, and there was not much wisdom on earth until he got here.  So they started to discount on account of his age, which, since I&#x27;m prejudiced in that field; I work the position in favor of the seniority system because experience is the most efficient teacher of all things. Well that was one thing; and you loose contacts with young people, and although he tried to maintain them it&#x27;s a hard thing to do.  The longer you stay in the Senate, the more you have to work, and the more you have to stay there.  Another thing, I think he made a mistake on the Vietmam Senator Sam Ervin                                 -8- war.  I believe if he had just stood like he had always stood, and supported it,I wasn&#x27;t necessarily pleased with it, because I felt like they were sending boys into battle to die in a war they would not let them win, and he felt more or less the same way, and I think he had just despaired of them ever getting enough intellegence to try to win the war and get out that way, and so I think he changed his views there, and in doing it I think he lost; if not the support; a lot of enthusiastic support of many veterans, and I think also he had had this drastic operation for cancer and people have a fear that cancer will return, and they had a feeling that if he was reelected that he would not be able to function throughout his term.  That is the way I would diagnose the situation.  Yes, I think he did campaign hard during that last election, but he had his brother Frank as his campaign manager and he had no experience in politics; unfortunately he had lost Henry just before that, and Henry was a master politician.  Everybody had confidence in Henry.  I think you have to keep in constant contact. I used to tell Everett, I ubud Lu huvu a little radio program I put on every week, and also these news things, and I think that kept me, well I couldn&#x27;t get around  to see people as much as I would like, but it kept me in contact with them, and I told them every week where I stood and why.  When I left the Senate I had 2 7 radio stations carrying me and it didn&#x27;t cost me anything.  I furnished the tapes and recorded it, sent it to them,and they sent them back, and consequently everybody knew where I stood.  I told Everett that he ought to do that.  I know Everett got a little miffed at me because he wanted me to leave Washington after the first primary and come down here and campaign, I said I couldn&#x27;t transfer my support to him, and he couldn&#x27;t transfer his support to me.  It just wouldn&#x27;t do for NC to have both of their Senators down here and nobody in the Senate.  I issued a public statement every time I got a chance to tell people that I was for him, and I Senator Sam Ervin                                   -9- didn&#x27;t know what else I could do.  I endorsed Everett every time, and he endorsed me; that&#x27;s about as far as you can go except tell individuals.  One time he offered me $5 00 cash for my campaign, and I said, &quot;Everett I don&#x27;t need this money in the first place, and in the second place there&#x27;s an old law I don&#x27;t understand on the books that says a Senator or Congressman cannot take campaign funds from a government employee.  I don&#x27;t think you are a government employee but I don&#x27;t want you and myself to get into Alc/atraz.&quot; At the time Luther Hodges appointed him to the Senate, I made a statement on the radio in which I praised the whole Jordan family, and that I thought it was a most suitable appointment, and I did.  I think that where I was weak, he was strong, and where he was weak, I was strong, and we just fitted right together.  I think between us we gave NC very fine representation.  We certainly gave them a very faithful representation. BB:  How would,assess his handling of the Bobby Baker case? SE:  Excellent in every way except one.  He had a very troublesome committee.  He had Carl Curtiss of Nebraska, Republican, I liked Carl and was fond of him personally, but he was so bitterly partisan.  The thing Bobby Baker ease came up several times.  The original resolution was introduced by Senator John Williams of Delaware to investigate when the charges were made.  Well most everybody in the Senate supported it. Then after the first investigation was completed, there came a charge that Bobby Baker had been instrumental in aiding a Democratic National Committeeman from Pa., I forget his name now, in getting a contract for the Kennedy Stadium in Washington.  And so Senator Mike Mansfield introduced the second resolution to reopen the matter, and conducted a second investigation.  All together the Bobby Baker investigation covered 45 days.  The Republicans introduced a lot of ammendments especially to the Mike Mansfield bill.  @%Exwas  I believe the rules Senator Sam Ervin                                 -10- committee probably had about four Democrats and three Republicans, anyway there was just one margin difference.  One ammendment provided that they had to subponea and examine any witness that four of them wanted..I mean that three of them wanted; in other words, let a minority of three run a seven man committee, the effect of it was. Of course we voted that down.  Then Carl Prentiss introduced one that Gil) that they had to call and examine any witness that any one wanted, and that was voted down.  Later they wrote an article....Watergate came along...saying that because Talmadge and ___________ and myself voted against these ammendments to let three then one take charge of the committee, that we had opposed the Bobby Baker thing.  XKXX We did nothing of the kind; like Everett we were strong for the..for the thing.  He investigated it thoroughly except I thought he made one mistake and that was this:  They were particularly anxious to get Walter Jenkins who was at the White HOuse, a long time employee of Johnson when he was a Senator, and also at the White House, wanted him subpoenaed because there was a little bit of evidence that he had had some agreements with Bobby Baker, under which Bobby Baker got somebody to furnish some insurance for Lyndon Johnson, and Major McLendon came to me to talk about it, said I been trying to get Everett to write a letter and invite Walter Jenkins to come down and testify, and if the White House does not want him to testify, make the White House take the responsibility, because they will criticize Everett if he dosn&#x27;t do it.  So he said I wish you would talk to him about it and see if you can persuade him to do it.  Well I talked to Everett,  &quot;Why in the world, if you don&#x27;t want to subpoena Walter Jenkins, why don&#x27;t you invite him down by letter, and if he doesn&#x27;t come it&#x27;s not your fault; it&#x27;s the White House&#x27;s, you let them put the monkey on your back instead of letting the White House keep the monkey. I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with him.  That&#x27;s the only thing I would criticize Senator Sam Ervin                                 -11- he did, otherwise I think he had a fair, completely honest investigation, and when I&#x27;ve heard it criticized, I&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, just compare him with Nixon and Watergate.   They investigated Bobby Baker for 4 5 days, the most expensive investigation up to that time in history probably.  They about unearthed a lot of evidence agaRs him, and they turned this evidence over to the justice department, and the justice department prosecuted him, and he was convicted, and he served in prison, and he didn&#x27;t have any president to pardon him, and he served his term.&quot; President Johnson Yes they were trying to linkxxksxWfeifcKxHiSHXKxwith Baker, but my attitude would have been to let the White House protect against that. I didn&#x27;t see that there was anything bad about it, because the only allegation was that Bobby Baker who had been a close friend of Lyndon Johnson during the time he was in the Senate, had contacted somebody, one of his friends to get him to make an offer to sell some insurance policies to Lyndon or his T. V. station, a perfectly legitimate action. I told Everett, &quot;The best thing to do is to put the cards on the table.&quot; When I first came to the Senate, you had Joe McCarthy riding high, wide and handsome........press.... communists leaders, and Johnny Adams, the Democrat who was the chief council of the committee, he wouldn&#x27;t let :%/. e/&quot;4&lt;&quot; /%&quot;&quot;f .........tell him anything.  He tried to hide everything from them.  They participated in three investigations of that, and the last they had changed administration, and they had a Republican, former Governor of Michigan, Rucker, he was the ggfEHXE attorney for the defense department, and he came down there and threw all the cards on the table, and showed that what happened was:  They had two files on everybody in the service one was a service file, and one was a security file, and for some did strange reason, never the twain wa%d meet, and finally when it came time for an automatic promotion for Major________, McCarthy made his charge of communism against him, and for the first time, his service record and his security record met J&lt;g%  in the department of the army Senator Sam Ervin                                 -12- and Johnny Adams the attorney had no regulation to cover that kind of subject at that time, so they gave him the promotion one day and discharged him the next, but he didn&#x27;t tell why.  He kept silent.  But Rucker(?) came in there and put all the cards on the table and showed just how it was and the whole thing vanished.  I told Everett if he would do this with Walter Jenkins, the whole thing will vanish, otherwise they&#x27;re going to keep criticizing you, but he was a great friend of Lyndon Johnson and wanted to protect him.  I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t see anything to protect him about, other than explain that it was a business transaction, I&#x27;m sure people would understand it as an entirely innocent act.&quot;  Of course...knew about Jenkins homosexuality... file had been closed years before, and the White House might have been afraid of that coming out, I don&#x27;t know.  Everett asked me when the rules committee started that investigation who I would recommend they get as a lawyer and I told hi m Lennox P. Mc Lendon(?) a good North Carolinean, and he&#x27;s one of the best lawyers I know, and a highly responsible person.  They conducted a good, a complete investigation. I guess Everett and Lyndon Johnson were on closer terms than any other Senator.  They were close personal friends.  So far as I know, they may have known each other before Everett came to Washington, but not well.  Of course, Everett was also chairman of the Rules Committee, he had a lot to do with the inaugeration and things like that, so he had a lot of personal contact with him that most of us didn&#x27;t have.  The rules committee is a very responsible committee.  It&#x27;s what you might call a housekeeping committee for the entire Senate.  That&#x27;s the reason Bobby Baker was under investigation; because he was an employee, and they had charge of all the affairs of the Senate.  A very important committee for that reason.  Had a lot of power.  It considered all the rules for the operation of the Senate; they would .....changes in the rules.          ---      ---      &lt;---       __      ___ Senator Sam Ervin                                   -13- March 24, 1981 Clyde&#x27;*was always a strong supporter of mine.  He was a wonderful person.  He circulated a petition in Alamance County, I don&#x27;t know how many thousands of people signed it.....Eugene Gordon...and I have known Eugene Gordon a long time as a lawyer, and also he has been Democratic County Chairman down there, and so I guess on account of Clyde, largely, VOtetSH   Lgrf Everett and myself spoketc_ Gene, I didn&#x27;t know Gene as well as I did Clyde at that time, but Gene Gordon has made a wonderful judge. Ramsey Clark didn&#x27;t want to recommend him (Woodrow Jones), all they had against Woodrow, was he was like me, andxsHBiHxsiESKK most Southerners he voted against Ci v*J_ Qqk_ ~ $            but the NAACP didn&#x27;t want him, and they had a _j______lt&lt;?^&lt;_______N.

<dc:description>I am Ben Bulla in the office of Senator Terry Sanford of N. C. This is February 1, 1989.  We will be discussing the late Senator B. Everett Jordan. Ben Bulla:  Senator, if you will please, tell me first how you first knew about Everett Jordan. Terry Sanford:  Well I first knew about Everett Jordan when he emerged along with Kerr Scott in my consciousness.  I suppose I had known that Kerr Scott was Commissioner of Agriculture; I suppose I at the Institute of Government had corresponded with him a couple of times, but I really didn&#x27;t know Kerr Scott.  But when he ran for Governor and Everett, I suppose, was his campaign manager, in any event he was one of his close associates, and Scott made him chairman of the party.  Well at a time shortly thereafter I ran for President of the young Democrats.  So I was President of the Young Democrats when he was chairman of the party.  I can&#x27;t remember how long he ramained chairman, but I think he stayed the whole four years, did he not? BB:  Yes. TS:  So I knew him in that relationship.  Now during that period of time he, of course, had some kind of a tiff with Kerr Scott and I don&#x27;t really know anything about that except that I do remember that at the State Convention when delegates were being selected to go to Philadelphia Scott had made up a list that included a number of people, including some younger people. As I recall he had Bill Staton, who is now State Senator, and had been on the campaign staff the number two man in Frank Graham&#x27;s campaign, and he had me, I had been President of the Young Democrats from the middle of Scott&#x27;s term. Then he had put me on the State&#x27;s Ports Authority.  So he had his list up and for reasons relating to that tiff Scott would not sit on the platform was the first indication I had of anything.  He sat out with the Alamance County people.  He didn&#x27;t want to sit on the platform with Everett Jordan, and said that Everett Jordan had torn up his list, and that was his perogative, to name a certain number of delegates to the convention, and that Everett had torn it up, and that Staton and my name was on that and that Everett had Page 2                                                                                                             Terry Sanford taken us off the list.  I didn&#x27;t, I suppose, especially care.  I hadn&#x27;t planned to go to the convention; I hadn&#x27;t sought it, and for that reason I could hardly have been disappointed, but I regretted that Everett and Scott had any kind of quarrel.  And, had there been any occasion to side with one or the other and certainly in my mind in any event I sided with Kerr Scott. He had been the person I had known; the person that had given me an appointment and brought me in the state government, and put me in a position that as he was going out of office I was running for the State Senate and coming in the office.  So I felt very close to Kerr Scott, and as you know, two years later I managed his campaign for U. S. Senate. Now I don&#x27;t remember anything but pleasant feelings with Everett Jordan during that period of time.  Whatever problems he had with Scott, there was no reason for him to have any problems with me.  In the first/11 couldn&#x27;t have crossed him if I had wanted to.  But I was a fairly active President of the Young Democrats.  We had--we probably did more--and it was expected in certainly the subsequent years--we had Vice President Barkley come to make a speech in Greenville; we had Sam Rayburn make a speech in Asheville; we had Sid McMath, who was a bringt young Governor in Arkansas; we had Estes Kefauver to Greensbor for a Young Democratic Rally. BB:  Did you ever have Johnson? TS:  Well I did when I was Governor, but at that time Lyndon Johnson did not quite figure in the way he did later.  In fact I don&#x27;t know where LBJ was in 1939 or &#x27;50. Everett always came to those meetings; certainly was encouraging.  We didn&#x27;t really have a structure where the young Democrats were dependent on the senior party, but I don&#x27;t remember anything but pleasant--it so happens that my tenure covered the campaign of Frank Graham and Willis Smith, and my guess is that Everett was for Willis Smith.  He wasn&#x27;t too active I suppose because he was Chairman of the Party.  But in any event it was Page 3                                                                                                             Terry Sanford apparent to me that he was for Willis Smith, and obviously Kerr Scott was for Frank Graham?-! was for Frank Graham.  I don&#x27;t remember anything in that period of time that Everett Jordan was anything but kind and gracious to me. ^      Now when did I see him again?  I suppose it was about 1956--in the J* meantime I had managed Kerr Scott&#x27;s campaign.  He had supported Olive in -n  1952, and Umstead had defeated Olive.  I went into the Senate, Umstead went into the Governorship.  Of course Umstead died and Luther Hodges took over. yj   So now as we approach the next gubernatorial election which would have been $4 1956, I got a call asking me if I would come up to Haw River and meet with X Everett Jordan and Henry Jordan and Scott.  The subject was that they wanted )^ Henry to run for governor.  Well I was very much in favor of Henry running N  r ^  for governor, but I did ask Everett how it happened that he had been giving v  Scott so much trouble, and now he and Scott were united in common purpose, \ and he said, &quot;That&#x27;s the way it is in politics.&quot;  In any event they had made up whatever problems and differences they had had in the past.. I agreed to do what I could and a night or two later I went to North Wilkesboro with Hen Jordan.  Obviously I knew a whole lot of people all over the state.  I had just come out of a statewide campaign with Kerr Scott, so I knew more people t than any of them, and I was ready to help him.  And I did a few other things for him.  And I suppose my name was in the paper--speculation with Everett&#x27;s who was for whom and the like.  At any rate I got a call in my Fayetteville law office from Luther Hodges and he said--he was of course was governor--and he said, &quot;How about meeting me for breakfast.  I&#x27;m coming through^ Fayetteville, meet me at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s south of Fayetteville.&quot; So I did.  Hodges was not a person to beat around the bush.  He was not a fellow  to engage in pleasantries very often unless it suited his purpose, but generally he got to the point.  I no sooner had sipped a sip of coffee than he said, &quot;Why are you against me?&quot; And I said, &quot;Why Governor, I&#x27;m not against you, I&#x27;m just for my old friend Henry Jordan.&quot;  It wasn&#x27;t an Page 4                                                                                                             Terry Sanford entirely satisfactory conversation of course--couldn&#x27;t be--but I played it absolutely candid with him and consequently we departed in a friendly way. But for a long time Hodges did not for forgive me for being for Henry.  I was about the only person that far out for Henry.  Everett was probably a partner--owned part of that Howard Johnson that we were in--along with Luther. Well, a year or two later it so happened that Henry decided he wasn&#x27;t going to run. BB:  Do you know why he decided not to run? TS:  Yeah, but it&#x27;s not for me to say because I don&#x27;t know first hand. BB:  Do you know second hand? TS:  No I won&#x27;t speculate on it, but I imagine that Hodges had a conversation with Everett and asked Everett, like he asked me, &quot;Why are you against me?&quot; Everett, no doubt, found less reason to be against him than I did.  I don&#x27;t know that; I don&#x27;t know anything about it.  All I know is that Henry  told me he just decided not to run--decided it wasn&#x27;t the time.  Well, it never became the time, because as I recall, Henry&#x27;s health slipped a little before another gubernatorial race, but in any eve311 that^s the last time, I&#x27;m sure, that he ever thought about running. J /         Now within a year or two Scott died.  Hodges was reelected in &#x27;56, took / office in January of &#x27;57 and in &#x27;58 Scott died.  As you know See-tf named 1 Everett Jordan.  I do not relate that to Henry&#x27;s not runningsome people do, but I don&#x27;t.  I have no information, I just think that what happened was that he talked to Everett and talked him out of their becoming opponents in , a race, find after all, Everett, I am the governor; I am running to be reelected I    on my own.  It&#x27;s obvious that I have to run; why should Henry run now.  I 1/ !  don&#x27;t think it was any more complicated than that. Well now I didn&#x27;t especially care who Hodges named to the Senate.  I wasn&#x27;t a candidate, though several people my age were. Page 5                                                                                                             Terry Sanford BB:  Who were some of those people at that time? )lo\7    , TS:  Well I thought he would name Veyt-pr) Gilmore.  He would have been a good choice I thought--a young man and able.  I always liked Voyct.  He was very close to Hodges. BB:  How about Ralph Scott? TS:  I&#x27;m sure that would have been a good appointment, but I don&#x27;t know whether his name was in speculation or not.  I know Joe Eagles--some of his friends--! don&#x27;t particularly remember anybody other than Voyt--I was sort of hoping Voyt would be named.  We were classmates.  lb sure other people can give you a list of folks. BB:  I heard Bill Saunders name mentioned. TS:  I don&#x27;t doubt it.  Of course at a time like that you&#x27;ll get 30 or 40 names mentioned. BB:  Hodges said he had 33 names on his list. TS:  That sounds reasonable.  Well now when he named Everett, there were two or three things that I could have done.  I could have applauded it and been overlooked--it wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference whether I applauded it or not.  Who cares? No I didn&#x27;t have any particular standing.  I decided that I wouldn&#x27;t applaud it for two or three reasons.  One of them was a mundane political reason.  In the first place, Ben Roney, who was the administrative assistant to Scott and a couple of other staff members--four or five--Roy -Riley was one of them--a couple of the womenr-Peggy Satterfield, Betty-- now Betty Jones who works for Bob Scott at the--and maybe one or two others, I don&#x27;t remember for sure.  I think that Bill Whitley stayed on with him and of course Bill Cochrane became his aidenumber one person. I have a one o&#x27;clock meeting.  As you can see, I&#x27;m running late. Well, I thought we needed to keep Scott&#x27;s organization which I had put together as much as anybody else.  I certainly, at that time, intended to run for governor, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure when I was going to run, but probably Page 6                                                                                                             Terry Sanford right away.  It had been my ambition for a while.  But that was the way that I could assert that I now have the right to speak for the Scott organization.  So, I said in effect, that if he wants to name his own business partner to the U. S. Senate, let him do it.  Let him do it forth-rightly.  It&#x27;s his business, but don&#x27;t let him come palming this off as his having named a &quot;close associate and friend of Kerr Scott to carry on the Kerr Scott program&quot; when everybody knew that for whatever else went on between them, they certainly weren&#x27;t headed in the same direction politically and philosphically.  That&#x27;s not to criticize either one.  It turned out that Jordan was a whole lot more like Scott than Hodges probably thought he was. But, by doing that, I instantly was recognized in Manteo, Clay County, Yadkin County, to say nothing of Mecklinburg County, as the young inheritor of the Scott people.  It was a very significant move, and a very beneficial move from my point of view, because there was nobody else then occupying that role.  And you know that in a one-party state you had organizations built around personalities.  Well I put myself in the leading role as deliberately and as consciously as I knew how.  Now I didn&#x27;t have all that much against Everett Jordan.  I didn&#x27;t really want to be a foe, and I had my very close friend Bill Cochrane staying in there, so he asked me to come to the little luncheon that they had when he was sworn in.  I came, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned everything in the air was cleared at that time.  And I think, though I don&#x27;t know for sure, that the air was cleared as far as Everett was concerned.  I think he understood politics well enough to know that Scott&#x27;s people didn&#x27;t like his being put in that position.  But I liked Everett, I always did like him.  In my connections with him from that point on they were much more constructive, not that anything hadn&#x27;t been constructive--I&#x27;d say not much more constructive, much more amiable.  The next time we crossed paths beyond the routine of his being my Senator was when I ran for Governor.  Now I didn&#x27;t expect a U. S. Senator to get involved Page 7                                                                                                             Terry Sanford in the primary and I don&#x27;t know that he did; don&#x27;t know how he voted.  He, most likely, voted for Malcolm Seawell in the first primary and almost likely voted for me in the second primary.  Though I don&#x27;t recall his making any statements or being visibly involved, and wouldn&#x27;t have expected it. Senators normally didn&#x27;t get involved that way, or at least that&#x27;s my memory. Now here comes the Presidential Convention after I get feefi nomination. We go to Los Angeles; I decide to be for John Kennedy.  All the Lyndon Johnson people, notably Everett Jordan and Sam Ervin and Hodges are for LBJ.  Now Hodges was not really for LBJ and that may not be relevant to your story.  Hodges wanted to stop Kennedy so the convention, as it likely would have, would turn to Stevenson.  And Stevenson could find no more better qualified person to run for Vice President than Luther Hodges.  In any event they were all--the three big ones--against me.  There were 76 delegates as I recall, all with a half vote.  At least 65 of them had been active in my campaigns--my two primary campaigns, a great many of them were old Scott people.  They were just about all my people.  Now Luther asked me if--said it would mean a great deal to him if I would name him chairman of the delegation.  We had always named the outgoing governors as chairman of the delegation until Philadelphia when Luther Hodges and Everett and others conspired to keep that honor from outgoing governor, Kerr Scott.  First time I suppose that was ever done in modern times. BB:  Who was chairman in Philadelphia, Everett Jordan? TS:  I don&#x27;t think so.  I think they picked somebody like Gregg Cherry, I don&#x27;t know who they picked.  Anyway they denied it to the outgoing governor. So Hodges had reason to fefi that I might deny it to him, but I didn&#x27;t.  In the first place I liked to follow that tradition; second place, just because Hodges got Seawell into the race was no reason for me to keep him as a foe, so I said, &quot;Of course.&quot;  Well he used that chairmanship to embarass me.  And I didn&#x27;t expect to carry the majority of North Carolineans with me.  I knew Page 8                                                                                                             Terry Sanford this was shocking, but I also knew it ought to have been done and I&#x27;m glad I did it, always have been.  But I had a hard time there, and they sent Bill Cochrane out to Los Angeles to bring me back to my senses, for God&#x27;s sake, before I threw over my chances to be governor and destroyed the party in N.C.  Why couldn&#x27;t I be for Lyndon? Well without dwelling on that too much except Everett&#x27;s part--Everett played no part.  He was out there--he was on the floor--!&#x27;m not sure how they worked the delegates then, but anyway he was out there, as was Sam.  Sam probably never got over that.  He probably stayed irritated with me for most of the rest of his life.  I don&#x27;t know.  We were always friendly and certainly in the later years on the surface, and after he retired we were friendly, but I always thought that he figured that I was a young upstart trying to mess up the party, and they were a little bit cool, and I thought unnecessarily so.  I knew what I was doing, it so happened they didn&#x27;t, at least the way history turned out. Johnson would never have been the president; there&#x27;s no way he could have won the presidency if he had the nomination.  But he wasn&#x27;t going to get the nomination.  Stevenson might have, which Nixon would probable have beat Stevenson, and anyhow the new generation had arrived and I was part of it. Now I was feeling a little bit abused. Jack Danilson(?) under -Br-u Pearson&#x27;s name had written  had done me the honor the morning of the voting to make me the target of accusation that the Kennedy&#x27;s had financed my campaign.  Of course that was rediculous. And his proof was that Redwine, though he didn&#x27;t call his name--who had worked for Scott--had told him that some of Lyndon&#x27;s friends had offered me $5,000--$10,000 maybe, and all I would have to do was to vote for Lyndon Johnson.  I said, &quot;Of course I&#x27;m not going to take any money under those circumstances.  Not on your life.  I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m going to vote for Lyndon Johnson or not, but I&#x27;m not going to ^fake any money.&quot; And Jack Adamson said, &quot;You know you have to have money for the campaign, if Page g                                                                                                             Terry Sanford he didn&#x27;t take that money, it certainly raises the question that he took Kennedy money.  It was pure nonsense on the face of it--slanderous, libelous too.  Drew Pearson later retracted it, but just in N. C.  You know he didn&#x27;t have the courtesy, or the decency to retract in the column.  He retracted it in a special story to N. C. papers, because the implication was pure lipbel. The implication was very clever, he didn&#x27;t say so.  Well the chairman of the Guilford County delegation moved to censure--in our meeting that morning--Drew Pearson for slandering their fair Democratic candidate nominee for Governor.  They had some stake in setting that down.  Hodges maneuvered it into being tabled.  You know, instead of supporting me--I had made him the chairman.  And people were saying, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re crazy as hell.&quot; And I was getting telegrams from N. C. &quot;Why are you for Kennedy?&quot; Anyhow I went over to see Kennedy that morning and I told him about what Hodges had done and I told him that if I ever recomendad him for any position in your government I hope you throw me out of your office.  He was standing there chewing gum and I remember him saying, &quot;He is a bastard, isn&#x27;t he.&quot;  Later on I went to see him in Georgetown and Palm Beach to implore him to put Hodges in the Department of Commerce.  By that time we had made up any differences we had. [i           But going back to Everett Jordan, and the reason I&#x27;m getting into all / of this, I was pretty badly treated considering I was the Democratic nominee jl&#x27; and I had to lead  the ticket.  However, Everett said to me, &quot;Kathenne and I are staying over with some friends here that we were on a trip with, and 1  we&#x27;re going out to dinner with them tonight, If you&#x27;re not going back to N. C. today, why don&#x27;t you come go with us?&quot; He was just very gracious.  I suspect, very kind.  I suspect he saw I had been abused.  Well I was very 1  grateful for that little kindness, and it didn&#x27;t seem very significant, but I told him that we&#x27;d be running together and I wanted him to know something. That though people were saying the opposite, that I would never run against him, that I&#x27;d always support him.  And I did. Page 10                                                                                                         Terry Sanford TS: Now let&#x27;s switch to Duke--quickly. BB:  0. K. TS:  He was a trustee at the time I was elected, so I presume he supported me in the past--I&#x27;m sure he did.  I assume it was a unanimous vote.  But he wasn&#x27;t an extremely active trustee and without checking back in the bookswhich you could doby that time he was a trustee emeritus in any event.  I came to the campus when great turmoil was abroad.  The students were demonstrating; classes were disrupted; the alumni(sp) were unhappy, and I had no sooner gotten there than we had Cambodia and Kent State. That&#x27;s the campus I inherited.  I said, &quot;Now we don&#x27;t want to fight each other.  I&#x27;ve been against the war longer than any of you have, and I know that this is not what the nation ought to be doing, but you&#x27;re not going N  to get anywhere staying out of classes; you&#x27;re not going to get anywhere fighting the university.  Why don&#x27;t we turn our attention to the people that can make the difference.&quot;  I said a whole lot of things to them; I&#x27;m sort of concentrating on what led to Everett Jordan.  I said, among other \ things, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Washington and talk to our Congressmen and Senators.&quot; K  So we did.  I&#x27;ve seen later reports that said I rode on a bus up there with them, but I didn&#x27;t.  I flew up there; I didn&#x27;t have time to go on the bus; but I was there.  They went to see Everett.  I didn&#x27;t go to see Everett with them; I didn&#x27;t go to see anybody with them.  I just went there to support them.  I wanted them to do it.  They got a great picture of Everett standing there giving the peace sign--the Duke students.  Never again, as I recall, did Everett vote with Johnson on the war issue. BB:  What year was that; do you know? TS:  Well it had to be the spring of &#x27;70.  And they got that great picture of Everett giving the peace sign. BB:  Everett Jordan gave the peace sign to the demonstrators? TS:  Oh the peace sign was for peace in Viet Nam.  You know, let&#x27;s get that thing wrapped up somehow.  Of course by &#x27;70 it was a horrible situation. Page 11                                                                                                         Terry Sanford Well to go forward from there--I had already made my peace with Lyndon Johnson long since, because Lyndon was put out with me for a good while since I was for Kennedy and not for him.  But shortly before I went to Duke he had asked me to be his campaign manager for his reelection in &#x27;68 and I had agreed to do it.  In fact I was in the White House the night he said he wasn&#x27;t going to run.  So LBJ and I had become good friends before I went to Duke, and Everett and I were good friends--! thinkat least I valued his friendship.  I could not say I was an intimate friend, I wasn&#x27;t really of the right age level.  But at Duke a number of things brought us together, and I felt very fortunate in having that friendship.  If you stop to think about it--it matured over some turbulent periods to where we were joined together there in a common purpose for a great university.  So his last several yearsfrom my point of viewwere a very heartwarming friendship that I greatly appreciated.  And I, of course, was with him off and on while he was in and out of the hospital. BB:  When he was a Senator and you were President of Duke was he a supporter of higher education? TS:  Oh yes.  Of course.  Well I suppose Everett always supported the good things.  He saw himself as somewhat of a conservative because he was a businessmantextile business in NC--that&#x27;s a fairly conservative mold. On the other hand you could never overlook the fact--that I always knew that&#x27;s one thing I said about Dave Coletrane at one time--they said he was too conservative, and I said they overlooked one fact, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m going to put him in charge of the good neighbor council.  You overlooked the fact that he is a devout, hard-working and committed Methodist.  And don&#x27;t overlook the fact that Everett Jordan grew up in the parsonages and so basically his instincts were going to be good.  And they were. BB:  As a Senator how did he perform? TS:  Bill Cochrane would have to answer that.  I had no way to have any Page 12                                                                                                         Terry Sanford inside information.  I didn&#x27;t have any reason to come up here very often. From back home perception he was performing very well, and I suspect, up here.  People liked him very much.In fairly short order,  he became chairman of an important committee.  You know part of that is what you are and what committees you are rising on and where you get to.  But that&#x27;s a very important committee--the Rules Committee--that was significant.  So I would think that he was certainly one of the fairly limited number  that you would call the leadership of the Senate.  That would be my perception from afar.  I didn&#x27;t know as much then as I know now about the Senate. But he was in the position that Wendel Ford now has and that&#x27;s a very potent position.  He presides at the inauguration among other things.  So I would say you would have to count him well abovewell above the average Senator.  I would see that he would be perceived that way in Washington, I certainly saw him that way from home. BB:  Other than his age and his health why did Nick Galifinakis defeat him? TS:  He didn&#x27;t need anything other than that.  He was virtually in a wheelchair when he announced he was running.  And it was just a very difficult thing.  Those two issues were dominant, though Nick kept saying they weren* Of course they were.  I don&#x27;t think it was anything more complicated than that here was a vigorous, hard working young man running against a person that the general perception was that he was tired; he was old, he was sick. It&#x27;s too bad, of coursehad Galifinakis been more patient, he would be today one of the leaders in the Senate.  But as it was it killed off his career and gave us a void that put Jesse Helms in the Senate which I don&#x27;t mind saying for the record I consider a dark day in the history of have NC.  Had Nick waited he would/ultimately probably moved to the Senate.  So many people the Senate is brashness and running against a dear old friend, a very dear old friendEverett Jordanand taking advantage of his age and his illness.  He ought to have left him alone and let him serve out his Page 13                                                                                                         Terry Sanford time in an honorable way; he was serving well.  And I think a whole lot j  of people just resented the fact that Galifinakis did that to Jordan, and they got even with him, and in getting even with him they certainly put the state in a position that I regret that we&#x27;ve been in for some 15 or 16 years.  Far too many years. i ^ BB:  Another factor: could it be that at that time the younger generation was more active than the older generation? TS:  Oh I don&#x27;t know that that had a whole lot to do with it.  Younger generations are always more active.  He was part of that crowd that had served in the military; he had a lot of good things going for him, and so it was Jordan&#x27;s age and illness that slowed him up, but there was a lot of momentun on Galifinakis&#x27; side.  He was a good campaigner; he knew how to meet people; and he got around and he was known in about every county in the state.  He had a great knack of campaigning, so it wasn&#x27;t just those things. Galifinakis was a good campaigner, but his timing was absolutely wrong, and his lack of patience lost him what would have otherwise Imve been a very distinguished public career. BB:  I know you have to go, and I thank you very much Senator, for this interview.</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>William Dallas Herring, longtime chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Education, discusses some of the issues he encountered during his tenure. He speaks in detail about education issues at the time of the interview, and offers his opinions on the state of democracy in the United States. Herring believes strongly in representative democracy, and worries that institutions across the country and in the state are falling prey to complacency, entrenched incumbency, and flawed processes. On a more granular level, Herring shares his opinion on proposed changes to the election of superintendent of education; evaluation of teacher performance; and curricula. Researchers interested in the details of these issues should read this interview in its entirety.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  JAY JENKINS: This is Jay Jenkins with the second interview with Dallas Herring for the Oral History Program. It is being conducted in his home in Rose Hill on May 16, 1987. Dallas, there was an interesting story in the newspaper this morning, the News and Observer, about a Carnegie funded effort to establish a national certification program for teachers. It is billed as an effort to have uniform standards and give them recognition and get higher pay and so forth and so on. I know that you participated in a somewhat similar effort a number of years ago, and I wish you would just talk about those two things.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, it is interesting. Jim Hunt is to head this board for the national certification of teachers. When I was in the hospital for a cancer operation in March a year ago, he was kind enough to call me. Bill Friday did and several others, and I was very much appreciative of it. Well, Jim told me what he was doing. He had just returned from a meeting of this group that is mentioned in the paper today, and he was all excited about it. He felt that it would lead to improved standards for the profession of education. This is, of course, an area in which I had experience for many years, and I was interested in what he had to say. I told him that it brought back memories to me. I served on the Board of Trustees of the old National Citizens Council for the Public Schools—or for Better Schools, I believe we called it—which was founded by Dr. James B. Conant, president emeritus of Harvard University. The Carnegie Corporation provided the majority of the funding for that group. When I joined them, Roy Larson, the president of Time, Inc., was chairman of the group, and they were making an effort to enter the hinterlands. I was chosen from North Carolina—I think largely because Guy Philips gave him my name—and Hodding Carter, not the one we&#x27;ve got now but his dad, and this other newspaper man from Little Rock…  JAY JENKINS: Harry Ashmore?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: No, it wasn&#x27;t Harry. It was the owner, the publisher, of the Little Rock paper. What was his name?  JAY JENKINS: Haskell?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: No, I&#x27;ve got his name in my head somewhere. I&#x27;ll have to go back to it. But there were very few of us from the South. We would meet frequently in New York. I remember I think I told you last time about the meeting in San Francisco in May of 1954. Larson had asked me to sit next to him at breakfast there in the Fairmont Hotel. That was completely out of my element. I had no business being there [laughter] —Beardsley Rummel, the father of the withholding tax  idea; Harry Sherman, the president of the Book of the Month Club; and John Hersey, a lovely person, with a very beautiful kind of a personality, deeply humane, author of The Wall and other books. Walter Lippman had spoken to us the evening before. I used to read Walter Lippman as though it were the Bible when I was at Davidson. I read the Charlotte Observer everyday. He was a very profound journalist and philosopher, and I cherish the memory of meeting him and hearing him. At any rate, on that memorable day, May 17, 1954, somebody walked in with a San Francisco Examiner, I guess it was, with a big headline announcing the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in the segregation cases. Mr. Larson turned to me and said, &quot;What is the South going to do about this?&quot; [Laughter] I said, &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t speak for the South,  I don&#x27;t know what the South is going to do about it. But I think North Carolina will do the responsible thing, and it will take some time.&quot; I said, &quot;What is the North going to do about it. What&#x27;s New York going to do about it?&quot; He didn&#x27;t seem to realize that they needed to do anything about it, and I think they haven&#x27;t gotten the message yet. That&#x27;s one of the big puzzles to me. Why, in trying to destroy a double standard and succeeding so well with it in the South, they have not pursued the idea to south Boston. [Phone ringing]   WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Sorry for the interruption. I digressed to tell you that little incident, and I think I had mentioned it before, but it was a means of giving you a background of my interest in what Jim Hunt is doing. We had a very vibrant group of people. The staff were young and energetic and optimistic, and our desire was, after World War II, to awaken interest all over America in the public schools—how tragically the need had been neglected. We carefully avoided telling the people what to do about it. The philosophy was to get them to form democratic groups, lay and professional, to inquire into the status of education, and then to determine what the needs were, and thirdly, to see what could be done to get the kinds of schools we agreed we needed. It was phenonemally successful. We had some thirty-eight thousand people involved in citizens&#x27; committees all over the country. They urged me to get Governor Hodges to appoint a state citizens&#x27; committee in North Carolina, which he did. Holt McPherson, editor of the High Point Enterprise, was chairman, and Raymond Stone became the executive secretary. Marvin Yount, the retired superintendent from Alamance, was the first one. We organized citizens&#x27; committees in every county of the state as a result of that effort. We followed the philosophy—which was highly acceptable to us, of course—of what kind of schools do we have; what kind do we need; how do we get the kind of schools we agree we need? That&#x27;s when I first met you. Pete McKnight 1 sent you to see me, and we made that trip to Connecticut, later on. 1 C.A. &quot;Pete&quot; McKnight, editor of the Charlotte Observer, a Davidson College classmate, 1938. I was invited up to Charlotte by Hal Tribble to tell the  story of what we were doing in Duplin—and by Dr. Garringer and Mr. Wilson, the county superintendent. At the apex of that experience, Ben Fine, who as I recall was writing for the New York Times, and Jim Cass, who was on the staff (he later became the education editor for The Saturday Review of Literature)… Gloria Dapper was his associate. The names begin to slip away, but these two I remember especially. They were pushing me to make a statement regarding the desegregation of the schools. I said, &quot;You make one about New York, and I&#x27;ll make one about North Carolina when the time comes.&quot; They wouldn&#x27;t do it. I said, &quot;When I retire and look down here, we did the job, and they didn&#x27;t.&quot; Ben Fine was among those, if I recall correctly—I&#x27;m not absolutely certain that he was in agreement with Carnegie, maybe he was not… Walter Heller, by the way, the economist, was in this crowd and spoke to us several times. 2 2 I should have added that Henry Toy, executive secretary of the group, also opposed the Carnegie proposal.  Carnegie forced a showdown. &quot;The time has come for you people to tell America what kind of schools they need. The time has come for you to confront Congress with the idea that this has to be done.&quot; So we had a crisis, and Conant was not in favor of our doing that. We were just a group of self-appointed citizens—some of them were distinguished people in the group, as I pointed out. But this is not the Royal Academy of Science of the French Republic, that dictates things. This is an American citizens&#x27; committee, and we just advise. There were many people there from all over the country who did not believe that we needed a centrally controlled public school system.  JAY JENKINS: Was that what Carnegie had in mind?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Carnegie wanted to do it, and do it now, and do it the simple way which was a totalitarian way. We told him to go to hell and wouldn&#x27;t do it. They withdrew the money, and the organization collapsed because nobody could afford to pay his way to San Francisco [laughter] plus New York many times. They gave the money to the Saturday Review of Literature and hired part of the  staff—Jim Cass and Gloria Dapper especially I remember—and they published a monthly education issue. Norman Cousins, I think, was general editor. He was so overwhelmed with the idea that we faced inevitable nuclear disaster that it stopped being the magazine that William Lyon Phelps and Amy Loveman and those people published for many years. It was so dear to so many of us as a place for gentle and genteel review of whatever literature&#x27;s worth reviewing.  JAY JENKINS: Did Carnegie underwrite that in the Saturday Review with the idea of promoting their view?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: They were doing it. They did do it. I finally quit taking the magazine because it was no longer the magazine I wanted. The last thing we need, in my humble opinion, is a very provincial, reactionary old gentleman in Duplin County… 3 3 I intended to say &quot;… dictating national policy in education.&quot;   JAY JENKINS: I disagree with your description, Dallas [laughter].   WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: [Laughter] I don&#x27;t need my colleague from New England or New  York to tell me what quality consists of. I could go into a great dialogue about the quality of the writing of history because it has been dominated by Harvard and Yale, with a very provincial view of the American Revolution, for example. They think we didn&#x27;t do anything down here about it. Ten years before the Declaration of Independence, the first armed resistance to British tyranny occured at Brunswick on the Cape Fear River below here. The first state in America to call for independence from Great Britain was North Carolina in the Halifax Resolves. It was before the Declaration of Independence. They pooh-pooh the idea of the Mecklenburg Declaration. I don&#x27;t know whether that occurred or not, but Halifax certainly is well documented. New England has distorted the picture of its folk heroes, Paul Revere for example. The Britannica says there is no evidence he ever made the celebrated ride that Longfellow wrote about. I know that Cornelius Harnett made a ride, several of them, and it&#x27;s well documented but not celebrated. So I am not for any New England prejudice about what constitutes excellence in education. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I enjoy and like to believe everything that Washington Irving and Nathaniel Hawthorne and Longfellow and all of these people wrote—James Fenimore Cooper about New York. I read them in my grandfather&#x27;s library when I was a child, and I dearly love the stories. And I have a passle of first cousins living in Connecticut that I grew up with, and I am not prejudiced against them. What I insist on is that Thomas Jefferson and others of his ilk found the answer to excellence in education and excellence in government, and it is pure democracy. We cannot tolerate totalitarianism in education anymore than we can in politics. The only place that we can tolerate it at all is in the military, and that has to be under civilian control. You see how it has gotten out of hand here under Reagan and Mr. North, Colonel North, or whatever he is, Admiral North. He decided that he had the know-how to solve all of our international problems, misguided young fellow. No doubt he had the best intentions in the world, and he had the shortcut answers. The Carnegie Corporation is in the control of people of ilk mind. So, I would say without any apology whatsoever, it&#x27;s the wrong idea. The genius of American education is that it is a grass roots operation. It has been from the beginning. It started in the churches, and it finally became a public duty by the community first—neighbors getting together and creating the American public school system with their own local effort. North Carolina again was the first state in the nation to recognize and establish a statewide school system in 1931 and &#x27;33 during the Depression. We established one of the few systems that is statewide. But we jealously guard the right of the local people to determine policy in education. If you don&#x27;t believe that, I know it from first hand experience. We established the community college system at the state level, and realizing our history in that respect that there had to be a grass roots effort or it would… [Interruption]   WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m telling what you need to know or not.  JAY JENKINS: Exactly right, the way it is. Do you think this latest Carnegie effort that Hunt is serving as chairman for is a reincarnation of that earlier idea?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, I thought about it when Jim called me a little over a year ago in the hospital, and I didn&#x27;t tell him. So he was kind enough to call me again, and he was enthusiastic about it. He felt that it was an opportunity to bring some quality into the picture, and it may be. I don&#x27;t have any doubt but that a benevolent monarch can solve a lot of problems. King David and King Soloman worked wonders with the Jewish people, and nobody has been able to manage them since then. But those two did, and all the other kings were more or less failures. I used to know them all by heart. I had to study them at Davidson. But it&#x27;s the wrong way to run a country.  JAY JENKINS: I noticed that in the story this morning in the paper that the president of the School Boards Association or something said this is an effort to turn it over to the teachers&#x27; union.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, there is some possibility of that. I think Albert Sanker, who writes for the New York Times a good bit, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, is an exponent of quality in education. It&#x27;s the old trade union idea. There&#x27;s a lot going for it, that the master craftsman is better than the journeyman, and the journeyman is better than the apprentice, and they are all better than the rest of us. You can&#x27;t get to lay brick under that system until you have served your apprenticeship and your journeyman experience, and finally, reluctantly, when you&#x27;re an old man, you can get to be a master craftsman, and your wages are established that way. That philosophy has been characteristic of AFT, and especially of Sanker as I read it, and I don&#x27;t know any more than anybody else who reads about him. I think Sanker sees that the only way to get an elite corps of teachers with high salaries, sixty and seventy thousand dollars a year, at present scales, in the public school system, would be to create this master craftsmen. So it&#x27;s not at all at variance for the trade unionists to agree with Carnegie that this short-cut to excellence is a desirable thing. But it leaves out the masses of teachers, and it totally negates the idea of democracy in American education.  JAY JENKINS: Do you think anything like this can succeed without grass roots participation?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, you know, you can appoint the committees and create commissions and get endowments, and the people are free to ignore them. They do as they damn please which is what they should do. I am afraid somebody will say, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re just mad with Jim Hunt because he didn&#x27;t reappoint you.&quot; The truth is Jim Hunt did me a tremendous favor, and I told him so. I am not angry with him about it. I think he made a mistake in not reappointing me, but I&#x27;m not angry with him. [Laughter]   JAY JENKINS: Well, you&#x27;ve been talking about the Carnegie approach anyway. It hasn&#x27;t been a personality thing.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I&#x27;m not sore with Jim, and I wish him well. It would be nice if they could succeed. I would like to see some change in it before I die, but I don&#x27;t think I will, and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to succeed. They&#x27;ll beat their brains out for the next five years establishing standards, and here and there across the country they will introduce the master Carnegie teachers and induce the legislatures to pay them more. But it&#x27;s undemocratic, and the democratic majority will not have a part of it. They&#x27;ll push him out the back door. What a sad thing. They are trying to do the right thing in the wrong way. That was the trouble with Hunt&#x27;s administration anyway. I say this with the greatest detachment from the personality. I told Jim personally—he served with us on the Board of Education for his term as Lieutenant Governor, and I got to know him very well… During the controversy with Craig— Craig wanted to be this kind of a dictator. He was this kind. He still is. He talks a lot about involvement with the people out in… You can hand-pick the people who can applaud and agree with him about something. He totally destroyed the citizens&#x27; committee idea. Let me give you a little experience here in Duplin County. We had some vocal critics of the public schools. We had the citizens&#x27; committee going, with harmony, very frank open discussions, black and white, before the Supreme Court ruling. Somebody said, &quot;Well, you&#x27;ve just hand-picked your crowd, and you haven&#x27;t got the critics on there. We made an effort to find our critics, and we got them involved, and they had an impact on what we were talking about and deciding. They influenced the judgments, and we came up with a better answer because we allowed the democratic process to function. Louis Outlaw, an old bachelor, member of the general assembly, a Universalist—and they don&#x27;t ever agree with anybody, not even God—and nothing suited him. Being an old bachelor myself, I can appreciate how he felt. We got him involved in that business and allowed him to get up, encouraged him to get up, and tell us where we were wrong, and to consider what he had to say. You cannot defeat the democratic procedure if you give it a chance, is what I&#x27;m saying. Carnegie is impatient of that. Jim is ignorant of it, and they are not going to succeed in the long run. They may have some initial success. What a tragedy because they are trying to do the right thing in the wrong way.  JAY JENKINS: So your idea is that they should finance these things on a state by state basis, and let it come up from the bottom.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I&#x27;m saying they should reactivate the citizens&#x27; committees. They should go back to Triangle and Cherokee County and Coinjock in Currituck, and say, &quot;What do you think we need to do about our schools.&quot; Walter Lippman made this point. He said every man is a philosopher. This man Adler, this brilliant scholar we have today, Mortimer Adler, makes the same point. It&#x27;s nothing more than Jeffersonian democracy. The amazing thing is that the American experiment has worked because we trusted the people, in large numbers, to make the right decisions, and you created a situation in which they could speak to the issues. I went out politicking for one of the candidates for governor one time in north Duplin. We came to a crossroads filling station-country store, and the boys had been out setting out tobacco, and they were dirty and barefooted, sprawled on the floor, glad to get a moment to relax. I was with Hubert Philips, a lawyer over here in Kenansville, and we were plugging the virtues of our candidate. We were not making much headway, but Hubert spoke to one fellow sitting on the floor with his back against the wall and his boots spread ajar, his overalls rolled up half way his shank bone and his feet just as dirty as could be. He got to talking to him about tobacco and got his interest. He said, &quot;How about voting for our man.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, it don&#x27;t matter how I&#x27;m going to vote anyway. It&#x27;s them people up there in Baltimore that&#x27;s the ones that elect the governor of North Carolina.&quot; [Laughter] He didn&#x27;t know his geography, but he made this point—they don&#x27;t give a  damn about us. We don&#x27;t have a chance. I said, &quot;Well, if you didn&#x27;t have a chance, I wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot; That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re over here for, to hear from you. It has worked, Jay, all the way through my career. When we got in trouble, is when we drifted away from the grass roots. Walter Hines Page makes this point over and over and over again, and I could cite you chapter and verse where it is that kind of philosophy that helps build America. We can drift into the idea of totalitarianism too easily, because it&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s efficient. It&#x27;s cost-effective. It brings the judgment now. But it has taken two hundred or more years to build what we&#x27;ve got, and we&#x27;re not through with it yet. [Interruption]   JAY JENKINS: Dallas, as you know, there&#x27;s a movement afoot to submit a constitutional ammendment that would make the state superintendent of public instruction appointive instead of elective. How do you view that issue?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, I have many feelings about it and considerable experience with the whole idea. First, let me say this. We are laboring under the fiction that we have a democratic procedure for choosing a superintendent, which is not true. The long ballot is not real democracy. It&#x27;s a way for an elite to decide who will be in these positions. I don&#x27;t feel that my dear old friend Jim Graham 4 is a typical North Carolinian, but I didn&#x27;t choose Jim for that job. 4 Commissioner of Agriculture Did you? Maybe he&#x27;s  doing the best that anybody can do, and I should think he&#x27;s doing very well. But we are laboring under the fiction that the people choose these council of state members. The people have no real opportunity to decide. It&#x27;s just a name on a ballot, and there are too many of them. There&#x27;s coming a time though—a procedure that neglects—I&#x27;m at a loss to explain exactly what I mean by that. We are going to elect a superior court judge for western North Carolina. We don&#x27;t know him. We don&#x27;t know anything about him. All we see is his name. That&#x27;s not democracy. It is an abuse of democracy. It is a use of democracy to maintain the status quo, meaning to keep the power where the power is. A Republican hasn&#x27;t got a Chinaman&#x27;s chance there, and everybody knows it. That&#x27;s one of the reasons for having it. Point number one, the system we have is not, really, de facto democratic though it probably could be argued to the jury that it is. What&#x27;s more democratic than having a statewide election? But the system is not producing a democratic choice. People intend to keep the incumbents in, and that&#x27;s the reason for having that system. If you will look at the superintendents that have been chosen since J.Y. Joyner, most of them have been appointed by governors. The most disastrous choice we&#x27;ve had was not appointed by a governor, but won when it was thrown open to a free election by Charlie Carroll&#x27;s announcement that he would not run again.  JAY JENKINS: You&#x27;re speaking of the incumbent?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yes. [Laughter] He&#x27;s not a Democrat. He&#x27;s a dictator.  I&#x27;m not angry with him. I&#x27;m telling you the historic truth about him. Okay, point number one, we do not have a democratic system. How do we get a better system? You see, I follow my own advice. What kind of a system do we have? What kind do we need, and how do we get the kind we agree we need? All right, the system we have stinks. What kind do we need? I would say we need one that provides the democratic safeguards, that provides the people an opportunity to make a wise choice. That&#x27;s complex. What are you going to do, have a precinct meeting and discuss the issues in over twenty-two hundred precincts? We believe, after all, in representative government. There&#x27;s nothing undemocratic about the idea of representative government. As a Presbyterian elder I have stood on that ground for many years and so has the federal constitution and the state constitution. We have tried to create the fiction in North Carolina, and the Council of State members from Thad Eure on down have tried to create the fiction, that representative government is most democratic—in insisting that the public elect all these professional heads of departments. That&#x27;s like saying we can&#x27;t choose the President of the United States to appoint the Secretary of State. The system seems to work very well there. If he doesn&#x27;t do the job, he gets booted out in a hurry, and most of them have turned out as failures, severely criticized. It takes years for their reputation to take shape again. Dean Rusk is only now becoming somewhat acceptable to the majority of people. Just as Truman went out of office with a lot of enemies— he is now one of our elder statesmen, even though he was one of the critics of Martin Luther King. Called him a &quot;rabble-rouser&quot; [laughter] , but we now accept Truman. My point is, in trying to answer the  question what kind of a superintendent do we need, we need one who is representative of the people. We just talked about Jim Hunt&#x27;s innocent, and the Carnegie Corporation&#x27;s not so innocent, desire to establish a hierarchy that will determine for all of us Catholics what kind of a religion we&#x27;re going to have, in education. I don&#x27;t want us to make that mistake in North Carolina. The trouble is, in practice, we have always made that mistake. We&#x27;ve had some great superintendents; we&#x27;ve had some mediocre ones; and we&#x27;ve had one disaster at least. I can document that, but I won&#x27;t go into that now. So we need a different system. We need one where democracy can come to play, and my point is that representative government is democratic. All right, having established the philosophical basis, let me give you my solution. In my last visit to the School of Dentistry to get this prothesis ground down and added to in places, I got the young fellow who was driving me to go by the Kenan Building. I didn&#x27;t have any idea where it was but we found it. I went in to see Bill Friday since … I didn&#x27;t like the way he was shoved out any more than I liked the way I was shoved out. I wanted to go by and shake his hand. He&#x27;s a great person. He and I came into office about the same time and worked very closely together over those years, and I am deeply grateful to him for his friendship. Going into the building, I saw someone across the parking lot going towards the door a little ahead of me, and I knew I knew who he was, but I couldn&#x27;t see him well enough to be sure. We went on up to the penthouse in this magnificient new modern structure, and Bill&#x27;s secretary recognized me and said he was out to lunch. I didn&#x27;t have an appointment. She said, &quot;Bill Snider is in here. Come on, both of you, and sit in Bill&#x27;s office and talk until he comes back.&quot; So we did. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Bill. You know, Bill served on the commission to rewrite the constitutional ammendments. It must have been in the early seventies. I&#x27;ve forgotten the year. He had charge of a subcommittee recommending changes in the governance of education. The result was that he took the state superintendent off the Board of Education. I talked with him about it at the time, but I didn&#x27;t realize he was going to do that. He had the idea that the professional head should not be a voting member of the board. Craig didn&#x27;t realize it until it was all fixed and voted on [laughter]. It was before we had an open split.  Bill said, &quot;I&#x27;ve just been to a meeting of the commission to recommend changes in the way the state superintendent is chosen.&quot; It was a legislative committee, I think, that appointed him. He wanted to know my view of it. I said, &quot;I&#x27;m on record favoring what we have and favoring the change, I can teach that the world is flat or it is round.&quot; [Laughter]. But here&#x27;s what I sincerely think is a solution to it  if you believe in representative government. The people who have to work with the superintendent should initiate the choice, that is, the board of education. They are the ones who do it locally. Take the county board of education in Raleigh, for example, for Wake County. They choose the superintendent. Realizing that this is a statewide responsibility and the people who choose are not elected state wide—they are appointed by the governor and confirmed by both houses of the general assembly—let them initiate the choice. They make their nomination to the governor, and if the governor agrees, he passes it on to the general assembly for confirmation. If he doesn&#x27;t agree, he tells the board of education to come up with somebody else that the two can agree upon, the board and the governor. If they finally reach an agreement, and it goes to the general assembly, the general assembly has the option to approve or disapprove. If they don&#x27;t approve of it, you go through the process until you get all three groups in agreement. Then and then only is the appointment made, and it is made for a term, not for life. When the term is out, we go through the same process. That is exactly the way we choose the controller. The governor doesn&#x27;t appoint the controller. He appoints him on nomination of the board. It stops there and doesn&#x27;t go on to the general assembly, but it should, I think. He handles the most money of any departmental fiscal officer in state affairs. There&#x27;s no reason in the world why the general assembly, being the ultimate authority, should not have the right to approve the person who&#x27;s going to handle all that money. They are elected by the grass roots. The governor is elected by the grass roots. They approve the members of the Board of Education, and the governor appoints them. What better system could you possibly find to bring about harmony and responsible leadership in the structure of education? You don&#x27;t produce these prima donas who think the board should be their rubber stamp and rooting section and not have any independent thoughts. Let me tell you this, if it had not been for the lay members of the State Board of Education, we would not have a community college system in North Carolina today. We would not have had the curriculum study that you and Pete McKnight and I were concerned with when we went to New York and Connecticut. We would not have had the citizens&#x27; committee movement. All these things came about at the insistence of local non-professional citizens taking part in policy making in education. The tendency of the elected professional is to secure his political position. If he&#x27;s an activist, as Craig is, very shallow in his intellect, he follows every nuance that comes along. He reads a new book on career education, and we have a go with that. He gets everybody excited and nothing really happens except turmoil. He overemphasizes one segment of education to the detriment of the rest of them. Craig has a genuine and commendable interest in early childhood education. He has done much to get the kindergartens going and has improved the primary grade program. I cannot in all truth say that he has done anything in the important areas of high school English programs. Foreign languages programs are being deemphasized. History was cutout of the curriculum—the history of North Carolina. American history was watered down, depleted, as were the social studies programs. The qualitative standards were obliterated. The state was watered down, depleted, as were the social studies programs. The qualitative standards were obliterated. The state accreditation means nothing now except the American Management Association&#x27;s idea and its system of management by objectives—a bunch of gobbledy-gook which means simply that you decide for yourself what kind of standard you want to acheive and then you measure your advancement toward that standard. What a far cry from the idea that there would be a concensus established by professional leaders throughout the state in a statewide, cooperative effort, local and state, to say what the ideal school should have and then measure the progress of the particular school towards the achievement of the ideal. No such thing as that anymore. The Southern Association is the only thing that we have, and it has its similar problems. So my answer is, we need a superintendent who can lead the people and perform his professional task and be assured of the backing of those who constitutionally establish policy and provide leadership in state government—meaning the governor, the board, and the legislature. That&#x27;s the procedure to get there. If he doesn&#x27;t perform, then the same procedure can turn him out of office and get somebody else. I told Bill Snider that I personally would support the idea that if a board becomes irresponsible and does not do its duty—you get a bunch of people there who are obviously misfits and not able to do it, not willing to do it, don&#x27;t want to do it, don&#x27;t know how to do it—there ought to be a way to remove them. The general assembly, on nomination of the governor or with the concurrence of the governor and the general assembly, could remove such people from office and appoint somebody in their place. I would have been a lot safer myself. I had the experience there with one or two appointments—such obvious misfits, who caused a lot of trouble, and had no desire to make a contribution, simply the desire to take sides and put up a fuss.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  JAY JENKINS: Dallas, there has been a suggestion, I believe it was by the State School Board Association, that all local supplements be ended. That is, that the counties that can afford to do it and are willing to do it, should not be allowed to supplement the pay of teachers and so forth. What are your views on that kind of an issue?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I will have to ask the question: is it democratic to do that? Let&#x27;s examine it and see if it is. What is the idea for doing that? Should we have a policy that, since I can&#x27;t afford a Cadillac, nobody else should be permitted to have one? We&#x27;re talking about individual and local initiative now. If I remember correctly, I was a student in high school in 1931 and 1933. So I am speaking from hindsight, and what I&#x27;ve learned, not from reading the history of it, but from serving with people who lived through that year. Old man Pritchett, for example, who was a member of our board for many years, was in the legislature when that legislation was enacted, and I&#x27;ve heard him speak about it many times. If I recall correctly—it can easily be checked—it was in &#x27;31 or &#x27;33 that they outlawed any local initiative or local tax to supplement the salaries of teachers when the state took over the payment of the salaries. I think I&#x27;ve heard Epps Reedy, who was superintendent of the Roanoke Rapids schools, say a number of times, in effect, that they were one of the leading school units in opposing the elimination of city units and the right of the city unit to tax itself to supplement the salaries of teachers and to add to the budget of the local school effort. Considering it from a philosophical point of view, I would have to say it is not democratic for us to say that once we establish the lowest common demoninator, below which no county may drop, the state will provide the funds to see that you have at least this minimun standard of excellence, potentially in every precinct of the state. It is not democratic to say nobody can go beyond that with his own effort. That&#x27;s a denial of humanity. I don&#x27;t know why Jean Cosby, who is Craig&#x27;s protege and in the Guy Phillips&#x27; organization of the school board association, would say you can&#x27;t have any differentiation. It&#x27;s not democratic regardless of who&#x27;s idea it is. It strikes me that it is just as wrong as the aristocratic viewpoint. I have told you that I thought it was wrong to establish a school for the gifted to take the cream of the crop to Durham in residential study and spend four or five times as much for those students as we do on the average across the state. In this case it isn&#x27;t the state diffentiating in spending more per student in one place than it does in another, it is the freedom of the local unit to do that. I will have to maintain that Roanoke Rapids or Charlotte or any other place that has the wherewithal to do it and wants to do it, should be commended in doing that. Having said that, I have another thought I think I need to get in there. You take the case of Ocracoke, which does not have enough children, even with the basic program, to have the versatility in its curriculum that it needs. The only way to get it is to hire extra teachers to provide it for the limited number of students. 5 6 Ocracoke is a barrier island, isolated from the mainland. If what we really want is not monetary  equality, arithmetic, we call it, but qualitative equality as far as state programs are concerned, the state can do it much cheaper in Raleigh for the Wake County schools where there are thousands of students to deal with, than they can do it in Ocracoke where there&#x27;s but a handful. So I would argue for monetary inequality in that sense to acheive qualitative equality in a minimum program for the state. Which is to say, obviously, that we would not spend as much per child necessarily in Mecklenburg as we would in Pender County, for example. But we can establish qualitative measures that can be acheived more or less efficiently in places, and far less efficiently in the isolated areas where it won&#x27;t take a lot of money to bring them up to standards. I am not making that very clear, but the thought is very clear to me. If what you are looking for is bona fide qualitative equality of opportunity, to live up to Aycock&#x27;s idea, to every child there should be reserved &quot;the right to have the opportunity to burgeon out all that there is within him.&quot; You can&#x27;t do that if the school doesn&#x27;t teach Latin, and he needs to know Latin and wants to know Latin, and there is no Latin teacher simply because the money that the state provides will not afford employment of that teacher. There are dozens of them is Charlotte, say, and dollar for dollar distribution will not get that kind of equality. Then the state needs to take an extra step for those communities that are so sparsely settled that they can&#x27;t do it. I met with Terry Sanford one time up on Wolf Mountain where a group of us spent the weekend up there at Jamie Clark&#x27;s invitation. Hyden Ramsey was there and several others. We spent the night in that old cabin, and the next day we went down that road, the Tuckasegee or something like that—downhill and I was holding on so tight I couldn&#x27;t see the scenery [laughter] —to a little school called the Canada school, of all  things, nestled back there in some of the highest mountains I&#x27;ve ever seen. It was a Saturday. The chairman of the school committee was dressed up and looked like an Amish patriarch with his little boy who had on black knee britches, like something out of another century, but very charming. We went in to see the school. There was nobody there but the committee. It looked like all schools the state had built. Had desks, blackboard. Sanford turned to me, and I said, &quot;Write somthing on the blackboard.&quot; He said, &quot;What should I write?&quot; I said, &quot;Write these words: study hard, study hard.&quot; So he did, and that was the end of that day. The kids came in Monday and saw it. He didn&#x27;t sign it but the committee chairman told them all who did it. That&#x27;s the key to it. A child goes back up into a mountain cove like that with all the beauty of nature that surrounds him, but the basic idea that Aycock had was that that child have an equal opportunity to burgeon out whatever talents he had, academic, classical, artistic, vocational, whatever it was. He didn&#x27;t really name over them, but to have that kind of opportunity. Charlotte and Winston-Salem, that jewel of the Piedmont with all of its greatness [laughter] , its nobility, and its patriotic philanthropy, provides for its  own very well. But it didn&#x27;t get back into the Canada school unless the state did it, and I&#x27;m saying to you that that child ought to have the opportunity to know about the great Greek and Roman civilizations and be conversant in those languages if you&#x27;re going to teach it anywhere, with state money. At the same time I would say, if Winston-Salem wants to build its own school of the arts on top of that, more power to them. Is that inconsistent?  JAY JENKINS: No. What you mentioned earlier, and what I would characterize as a watering down of the curriculum in terms of American history and so forth and so on—it seems to me we have a lot of fads these days, and the basics seem to be overlooked. I remember a professor in Chapel Hill, who was a visiting professor over there, and he was teaching juniors, and he said he assigned a three hundred word theme to some university juniors, and this great sigh went up. He said, &quot;How many of you up to this point have had to write a theme?&quot; He said about a tenth of the hands in the room went up. Of course, I went to school a long time ago, but I find that a little hard to comprehend.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I have a solution to that. If I were the commissar of education, the first thing I would do would be to overhaul the English curriculum in the public schools. I would double the number of people teaching English. I would give them assistants in grading the papers and counseling students in how to express themselves. Listen to a conversation of these beautiful young athletes who have so much talent, and they cannot express themselves. Every other word is &quot;you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.&quot; Crying out to me as listener, &quot;help me to say what is in my mind.&quot; The damn trouble is he hasn&#x27;t got anything in his mind. He hasn&#x27;t got a mind to develop. All he has developed is his physical skills. Would you agree to that?  JAY JENKINS: Yes, of course.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: It is the sin, not of that student, but of those who make school policy that allows that to happen in higher education or public education at any level, whatever level. So we do something about it. Communication, the ability to understand the language and to use it with facility, is the most basic thing that you&#x27;ve got in education unless arithmetic may be considered more basic. One is the language of mathematical ideas, quantitative ideas, and the other is the language of philosophy, history, the humanities, the way we communicate. These are the most basic things and are sadly neglected throughout schools. We waste a lot of time talking about the difficulties of teaching children to read. There isn&#x27;t anything difficult about it. It&#x27;s simple. You cannot learn it without committing some of it to memory, and if you are going to approach it with the idea that memorization is anathema to education, then you cannot teach them to read. I went into a school in Gaston county at the invitation of the people. It was a private school that had been pushed, shoved, out the back door of the public schools with a group of students they call dyslexic, a made-up word to apologize to themselves for their failure in the public schools in my opinion. I walked down the hall, and I heard students saying, c-a-t, cat. The whole crowd was shouting it out and spelling over simple words in unison at the top of their voices. I had forgotten that in the first and second and third grades in the nineteen twenties we did the same thing, way back there. In another class they were doing the parts of speech. A verb is a word that asserts action, being, or the state of being. They said it all in unison, and then they stopped suddenly just like an orchestra that is perfectly trained to stop suddenly. And one solo points to Tom, Dick, or Harry to give an example of a verb that asserts action, one that asserts being, one that asserts state of being. They did this together over and over and over again. They did it in the multiplication tables. In another class they were reciting facts of history that they wanted to burn into their memories. Now the education profession disdains that kind of thing.  JAY JENKINS: How do we correct it?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Do you mean how do we change to that or go away from it?  JAY JENKINS: How do we get back to some basics?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: We put a board of education in authority to choose a superintendent who will support its philosophy. Then if you don&#x27;t like the philosophy, you turn them out by legislative and gubernatorial action. That&#x27;s the way you do that. What we do is elect a benevolent monarch, and he tells us that he is doing great things, and you just go away and shudder and forget about it, and get absorbed in genealogy or something else.  JAY JENKINS: Let me ask you about another subject, merit pay. They have some programs in the Wake County schools that I&#x27;m familiar with, and it&#x27;s caused a lot of dissention. The teachers take issue with the way they evaluate the teachers for the bonuses. They say they grade them too much on the mechanical end of it, and so forth and so on. Talk about that in theory and in practice.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, when I went into the state government, there was a commission, around the Hodges administration, and Arthur Kirkman from High Point was in charge of a commission to establish a merit pay system. Watts Hill, Jr. served on it, and Watts got all excited about it. &quot;Shorty&quot; Spruill was the executive director of it. I told Watts that it would never amount to a row of beans and he was wasting his time that it would never be adopted. I said I&#x27;m not going to oppose it, but you&#x27;re not going to get anywhere with it. Differentiated pay in a system with fifty thousand employees has to be based on the subjective judgment of somebody. I don&#x27;t see how it can be done unless you can remove that subjective judgment from the immediate scene. Now that&#x27;s the genius of the idea that Jim Hunt and the Carnegie people are dealing with—differentiated pay based on an objective sliding scale, far removed from the people that are involved. So that we can say, well, if she&#x27;s a Carnegie teacher, therefore she&#x27;s entitled. You have the right to become a Carnegie teacher if you do these things. You remove the personal conflict, the enmity. I don&#x27;t think you can remove it, but you diminish it. I&#x27;ve already pointed out the defect in the Carnegie proposal. It&#x27;s not democratic in the way it&#x27;s achieved. That is not to say that we could not have a national effort to achieve the same thing in a democratic way, not just for the teachers to establish who&#x27;s competent, but the lay public. We make the analogy with the medical profession and say that doctors are the best judges of what it takes to be a good doctor. I quite agree with that. I don&#x27;t know what it takes to be a good doctor. I can measure the number of patients that he loses maybe and decide that, but education is something else. We&#x27;re all involved in that. It is a mistake, I think, to say that it is like a science or an art that is isolated and only the people involved can decide. I know who my best teachers were. I had a lot of them. The one that was the best teacher, and I would choose from all my experience, the one I detested the most, he was a professor of Greek. He scared the living daylights out of me. He motivated me to learn that language, and I didn&#x27;t really have the great ambition that I thought I had to master the civilization of the Greeks and Romans [laughter] if it took learning all that detail. I just made a start, and I  didn&#x27;t get very far, but I had two years of Greek. That man made me learn it. He knew it in the first place. He knew it, not how to impart it, but how to elicit an understanding of it from me. It was the strength of his personality more than anything he ever learned in a book that caused him to be an effective teacher in my situation. Well, that&#x27;s the key to it in my idea. I doubt that we can remake all the public school teachers in the image of John Crooks Bailey as a Greek professor. So I would say, what is it that made Socrates, recognized today all these centuries afterwards, a great teacher? Nobody argues that he was a poor teacher. It&#x27;s sort of like the idea of pornography. Everybody knows when a thing is pornographic. It is only the lawyers and the judges who can&#x27;t decide [laughter]. They are the experts, and they don&#x27;t know. They have  not been able to come up with a workable definition of pornography. But you know, don&#x27;t you, when something&#x27;s pornographic?  JAY JENKINS: [laughter] To me, yes.   WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, even to a majority of people. So I don&#x27;t know the answer to that, except this—I must have strayed from your question—I think there is a kernel of truth in the Carnegie idea that we could establish and have accepted by the profession and the public, a superior class of teachers to whom we are willing to pay more money and grant higher status. My only point about that is that there should be a standard, and these people should be arrived at through democratic rather than totalitarian procedures. The advantage is that it is removed from the pressures of the community where political influence can be very decisive. Let me give you another case in point. We established a community college in Martin County, Williamston. I always had a high opinion of that county. I still do. There are some very fine people there. But I&#x27;ll be damned if it isn&#x27;t run by a handful of politicians, cliques at war with each other. They live this warfare all the time. No president that goes there, no matter how good he is, can survive very long. He&#x27;s got to hire this faction&#x27;s relatives or he won&#x27;t last, and if he does, the other crowd is going to run him out. I don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;ll ever outgrow that or not. It&#x27;s an anomoly that we see in various parts of the state more than we do in others. You can&#x27;t keep a superintendent in Brunswick County over two or three years. They&#x27;ll run him out if the other crowd gets control. Carteret County is the same way. They haven&#x27;t been too successful in keeping one in Wake County in the last few years either. There is a certain stress, especially in stressful times, that can bring itself to bear on the personalities in the local situation. So the value of a national board, objectively stating what these standards should be and admitting by objective tests people to this class, has value. My point about it is, who sets those standards? It should be done by consensus nationwide, and not by a handful of self-appointed experts. I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ve confused the issue or elucidated it.  JAY JENKINS: The thing that bothers me about the evaluation of teachers and so forth is you can find somebody who&#x27;s a master of the subject but can&#x27;t convey it or inspire any enthusiasm. I suppose that&#x27;s an immeasurable ability.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: It is. It&#x27;s like judging Picasso and Rembrandt and Michelangelo. What do you think Rembrandt would say about Picasso if he could see him today? Who is to decide who is good, and who is better, and who is best in this? I have my ideas, but look at the modern day whim for Picasso, and I would say right off the bat that I&#x27;m not in the majority in that evaluation.  JAY JENKINS: I guess some problems are just not soluble.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Look at it this way. We haven&#x27;t found the solution yet. A generation ago, when you and I were kids, nobody ever thought that we would ever walk on the moon, and it&#x27;s being done.  JAY JENKINS: What about the national teacher examination? That always comes in for periodic…  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I had a part in that. I suppose you&#x27;re familiar with the role I played there.  JAY JENKINS: I wish you would talk about it.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Do you remember Grace Rodenbeau?  JAY JENKINS: Stokes County.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: You see, we have an advantage in long memory. Ed Wilson, Addison Hewlett, Hugh Johnson, Grace Rodenbeau, the sage of Stoneville, what was his name, Clarence Stone, people in that group—when the third house met in the Sir Walter, they cornered me there one day on the balcony. They were talking much as we have talked today about many things in education. It was not a reaction to desegregation. It was not what they were thinking about. They were about to put in a bill to establish a national teachers&#x27; examination, the score, as a condition to certification. I had some charts showing the discrepancies in the institutions. There were vast differences between St. Augustine&#x27;s and Duke University&#x27;s performance.  JAY JENKINS: On teacher examinations?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yes. And there were differences in the race also on the average. It was overlapping but the majority showed a difference. It astonished me and alarmed me, and I asked them if they would withhold that action and not mandate the cutoff score until we could have some experience with it. I said you don&#x27;t know where the cutoff score, the minimum score, should be. I said it occurs to me that it ought not to be below this point where at least twenty-five percent of the teachers would be black because they were twenty-five percent of the population. To be fair to them we ought not have a score so high that we could not get twenty-five percent of our teaching replacements with blacks. [Interruption]  A.C. Dawson, who was the head of the NCAE staff, got wind of it, and he, of course, was about ready to stir up the teachers about it. I said, &quot;Well, there is no point in creating a battle here. You&#x27;ve got your budget to prosecute, and we were trying to get some more money for the teachers. If you go and have a knockdown, drag-out fight about the teachers examinations, it will jeapordize the budget. So let&#x27;s not have a fuss about it. Let them go ahead and tell us by resolutionn that we&#x27;ve got to give the examination, and let&#x27;s establish an experience with it. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it as a law. As people who give tests, teachers ought not to object to taking a test.&quot; So we reached a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that we would do that. We told Rodenbeau and Wilson and Johnson and all of them that we would give the test. We would require it to be taken by all graduates of each of the approved institutions. We would maintain the records by institutions so that we could see what the experience was. Then they wouldn&#x27;t have to establish the minimum. I would see that the board established the minimum. They agreed to pass the resolution. I think you&#x27;ll find in the legislative journal the record of that. I&#x27;ve got it back there in my files. Several years passed, I couldn&#x27;t tell you now without going back to the record what year it was, that we had finally established the entrance level test score. It was while Dr. Carroll was there, and it was when we adopted the so called approved program approach to teacher certification which was advocated by the National Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. It meant that we would send committees in to each one of the institutions to look closely at the programs and evaluate them against standards that were agreed upon. They would point out weaknesses and would put some institutions on probation until these were corrected. Essentially the program is still being followed. The time came for the approval of the first institutions under that new approach. The University in Chapel Hill and East Carolina were the first to come up. Guy Phillips, the Dean of the School of Education at Chapel Hill was on the board. We were meeting there, at night, and the issue came up. I said, &quot;Well, now, I will remind you that I&#x27;ve informed you of an agreement we made with the legislature. I, as the chairman, made the agreement and informed you of it. I heard no objection to it from the board that eventually we would establish a cutoff score, and now is the time to do it.&quot; And there was objection. I said, &quot;Well, I feel that if we do not, then the legislature certainly will. I will have to tell them that you refused to do it, and I have to tell you too that I&#x27;m not going to approve any more of these programs presented to us until the minimum score is established as we agreed.&quot; That put a different light on it. Dr. Carroll said, &quot;I agree that we need to establish a minimum score.&quot; I said, &quot;Guy, we are not suggesting that Chapel Hill can&#x27;t train teachers. But you are the bellwether of the whole group of institutions and if you are unwilling to have your teachers examined, how can you expect Barba Scotia to have its examined? They go with a degree and get a certificate equal to that of a graduate of the University of North Carolina and Duke University with no further examination. If you approve that program, and you&#x27;re going to approve it sooner or later, you&#x27;ll make a provisional approval on some things…&quot; They&#x27;re still doing that. I saw in the News and Observer not long ago where they have given a notice to have it straightened out in a certain length of time, or they weren&#x27;t going—same old ball game. People at Barba Scotia know damn well they&#x27;re not going to shut them down. So they are taking their own good time in doing what they want to do about it. So we put it on individual acheivement. After all, a student at Barba Scotia who has achieved well should not be penalized because his instututin is not up to performance. You&#x27;re getting at the wrong person. So we approved a minimum score. I think it was 950, or something like that, to establish where we would get twenty-five percent of the black population. The result in the next succeeding years, we had an improvement in the performance, on the average, of the institutions in the state of sixteen percentage points. Craig came to see me when he was running for re-election, and he gently brought the issue up. He wanted to do away with it, and I opposed him in the board at formal meetings. Craig is very skillful at getting away from the press. We all know we had the rule that we couldn&#x27;t have a meeting without the press. I told him I would not attend any meeting that the press was not notified of even if we will have them in your office, in your home, at Carolina beach, or anywhere else. They may not be there but they&#x27;re going to know that we&#x27;re meeting. We&#x27;d go out to the Rebel Room—you know where Red Balentine had that special room—and we would go for a social evening together. It was a very pleasant kind of thing. After the press came and finally got tired of it and left, then is when we&#x27;d raise critical issues [laughter]. He said he told the board he wanted to do away with  teachers&#x27; examinations. I said that would never do. He said, &quot;Well, there&#x27;s no law against it.&quot; I said, &quot;There&#x27;s a rule against. There&#x27;s an agreement with the leadership of the legislature.&quot; He said, &quot;That&#x27;s ancient history. They&#x27;re all gone.&quot; Add Hewlett 6 was no longer there. 7 Speaker of the House, 1959 Grace Rosenbeau was dead, and Wilson works for the community  college [laughter]. I said, &quot;An agreement is an agreement. A policy is a  policy that we have established. It&#x27;s part of the common law of school policy, and it&#x27;s dishonest to abolish it without notice, and I will oppose it. The primary was approaching. Craig came down to see me one Saturday. We sat in there in the library, and we talked about everything under the sun. I wondered what was it he came down here for. Finally he brought it up. He said, &quot;Since you oppose the elimination of teachers&#x27; examinations, I&#x27;m not going to advocate it anymore.&quot; Skipper Bowles was running for governor and I was trying not to get too involved in it, but of course Craig was running. It went along fine until after the primary, and Skipper won that. Everybody assumed Skipper would get elected, I included. I went up to see him and talk about his program for education. Gerald James had gotten to him and sold him on the idea of a fifty million dollar increase in vocational education in the public schools. Gerald used to be head of the Division of Vocational Education in the Department of Public Instruction. He had had his following at N. C. State and throughout the state, and he was sincere in trying to get it passed. I said that I felt it would not be politic at all for the board to be caught asking for less than what the Governor was likely to be proposing. So I asked Skipper, &quot;What do you propose to do with the fifty million dollars?&quot; He said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea. I&#x27;m going to leave that up to you all [laughter].&quot;  I came back by Raleigh and told Craig and A.C. Davis where I&#x27;d been and what I&#x27;d learned. I said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to do something about that.&quot; I didn&#x27;t realize, but that&#x27;s when Craig and I began to break. He did not want Skipper Bowles, or anybody else, dictating to him what the budget of the department should be, what we should ask for. Davis wouldn&#x27;t move. He was caught in the middle. He wouldn&#x27;t put it in the budget. We went down to Wilmington to the superintendents&#x27; conference, and I found that they had not prepared any fifty million dollar proposals for vacational education. Barton Hayes was chairman of the committee of the board, and he was very much in favor of it. He was pushing me. We went up to see Craig in his room, and he was having a cocktail party, a bunch of women in there and we couldn&#x27;t talk business. He had a couple of guys playing the guitar. I don&#x27;t go for that kind of stuff. I don&#x27;t drink, and I don&#x27;t care for it. So Barton and I went on downstairs and called Davis on the phone and told him to come down there. We cornered him and told him that if he did not put the fifty million dollar proposal in the budget that Skipper Bowles&#x27; proposed that we would do so ourselves and we were going to make issue in the formal board meeting about it. So I went on back to Rose Hill. I don&#x27;t go to conventions of undertakers, and I don&#x27;t like to go to conventions of school people where they carry on like that. Davis called me, and he was almost in tears and said, &quot;We want you to come back down here.&quot; I said, &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; &quot;I want you to see Craig. He&#x27;s going to cause a lot of trouble about this.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s just going to have to cause it. I&#x27;m not going down there anymore. I did leave a message.&quot; Then I got a call from Jerry Melton wanting me to call Craig, same story. [I indicated to him that the issue was not negotiable], and said &quot;I mean it, and I don&#x27;t intend to change. Craig will just have to do whatever he wants to do today.&quot; The result was that Craig called me from Raleigh after the meeting was over and said he wanted to postpone the board meeting and move it to Greensboro instead of Raleigh. I said to myself he just doesn&#x27;t want Ed Gill to be there because Gill was not going out of town. To make a long story short, we went to Greenboro and several of them were missing. Charlie Jordon was there from Duke, and Barton and I. He brought up his proposal, having button-holed all the members of the board that he could and gotten them to agree to delete the teachers&#x27; exam in the initial certification of the graduate with a master&#x27;s degree, and to appoint a committee to report in December whether or not to abolish the requirement for the A certificate—that is the baccalaureate graduates. We were outvoted, Jordan, Hayes and I, by the rest of the board. From then until December 7, Pearl Harbor Day we called it, Craig had effective control of the board. He abolished the plan of accreditation of local schools and substituted the American Management Association idea which is not accreditation at all. He just abolished accreditation. I chose to be quiet about it. They could have voted me out of office as chairman any time they wanted to, and I felt it strategically wise to let the issue settle down. The News and Observer paid no attention to it. The Greensboro Daily News had one paragraph about the abolition of it, and it did not bother them at all, no editorial comments. I said I must be living in a dream world. I thought everybody would be alarmed by this. The situation was very tense from then until December. You know the result. Skipper Bowles was defeated. Our budget request included the fifty million dollars. Jim Holhouser came in instead. Neal Rosser, a member of the board that Governor Moore had appointed, had died. So there was a vacancy on the board. Bob Scott appointed Doris Horton, Carl Goercu&#x27;s daughter. She lived in Pittsboro but he appointed her to represent the district from Raleigh to Rocky Mount. I told him it was unconstitutional, and he told me it was none of my business [laughter].   JAY JENKINS: This was when Scott was governor?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yes. He said he decided such things as that [laughter], and I said it was quite all right with me but the Republican  governor&#x27;s going to decide it in the long run. Bob and I could talk. That&#x27;s exactly what happened. Jim Holhouser and Bob Morgan, attorney general, turned Doris Horton out and put Republicans in her place. Well, I&#x27;m giving you too much history, but at the December meeting, Craig came in with committee report recommending the abolition of the national teachers&#x27; examination&#x27;s minimum score. He retained the score, but he watered it down by another test of subjective values so that anybody that wanted to could get by without meeting the rated score. I voted against it. Burke Davis&#x27; daughter had just come to the News and Observer. I met her that day, Angela Davis, a very competent reporter with a very keen intellect. She&#x27;s a UNC-G graduate—masters at Duke I believe. She came up after the meeting and wanted to know why I voted against it. I said, &quot;I anticipated that somebody would have…  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: During the meeting on December 7, this was in &#x27;72, I guess—Holhouser came in in January of &#x27;73, didn&#x27;t he, that we call Pearl Harbor Day—I didn&#x27;t say anything against it in the discussion Craig brought up. I was presiding, and I tried usually not to be too forceful in the statements I made during meetings when I knew there was a division about it. Everybody on the board knew my opposition and expected me to vote against it, and they knew why. So it was really redundant for me to say anymore about it. I think, amazingly to us, Dr. Harold Trigg, the only black member of the board, voted with us. He voted to oppose the elimination of the test requirements. I don&#x27;t know whether he knew what he was voting on or not. He had become somewhat senile, but I think he did. I think he was enough of an old scholar and philosopher of the old system that he felt it was a way to preserve excellence in the profession. That was his conversation to me. At any rate, we were outvoted. I had prepared, the night before, a brief statement, so there wouldn&#x27;t be any misquotation and made some copies. I said—a pretty terse statement, I guess—I said, &quot;The blind cannot be expected to lead the blind. There&#x27;s no such thing as a school without scholars, it&#x27;s only a waiting room. I cannot in all conscience agree to this thing which I consider to be a disaster for the cause of excellence in education, and that&#x27;s all.&quot; Angela was very much in favor of my view. I don&#x27;t know whether it was she who convinced Claude Sitton, 7 who was new to the News and Observer. 8 The editor. I knew that Tom Inman and I agreed on it. He and I had  talked before. I was, nevertheless, greatly surprised the next day to see the headline on the front page of the News and Observer alerting the state to the fact that a disaster had occured on the previous day [laughter].  Craig went to New Orleans, without realizing there was any problem, to attend a meeting of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the only remaining qualitative standard giver in the field of education. Jerry Melton was fit to be tied. He called me back home and alerted me to the fact that he was distressed. I said, &quot;Well, you all took the action.&quot; I voted against it, and I told him why, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;d done about it. &quot;I don&#x27;t publish the News and Observer. I don&#x27;t write pieces for it. I&#x27;m not the editor of it, and I&#x27;m not a reporter. But I stand by what I&#x27;ve said, and it&#x27;s no more than I have said to the board previously. I didn&#x27;t make any public statement yesterday except this one in writing.&quot; He called Craig, and the next day the damn thing was worse. Then Ed Gill decided, &quot;by damn this is a good thing, and I want to get into this too&quot; [laughter]. He and I were chums from way back  [laughter]. We had a lot of fun together. He made his judicious statement  that it appeared that the board had acted in undue haste [laughter]. He had been late getting to the meeting. Craig would bring up an  issue so Gill would be out of the way, you know. There were only three of us that voted against it. Gill came in late, and he would have made four as I recall it. I may be off on that. Well, the News and Observer wouldn&#x27;t turn it aloose. In the Sunday edition, this was on a Thursday, by Sunday it was getting to be a hot political potato. You know how they do that kind of thing. You go interview Tom, Dick and Harry and see what they think about this [laughter]. Somebody said, &quot;Well, if the doctors are going to be  examined, I don&#x27;t see why the teachers can&#x27;t be examined.&quot; And the other one said, &quot;Yeah, even the electricians and beauticians have to be examined. Who do the teachers think they are that they can get away without being examined.&quot; And the idea just grew and mushroomed. My own senator, the distinguished gentleman from Lenoir, Harold Hardison, had never seen fit to come by to make my aquaintance before that. But he began reading the paper and decided it was time for him to know who I was and what I stood for. Dixon Hall brought him over to see me, and we had a good conversation. He said, &quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t give a damn whether you have the exam or not, but I am hearing from people all over my district, and got to do something about that.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m disappointed to hear you say you don&#x27;t care, but you want to serve the people&#x27;s interests in what they want to do. You&#x27;re going to hear more of that because the other papers are going to be picking this thing up.&quot; And sure enough they did. Out of all of the major dailies in the state, the only two that did not oppose the action of the board were the Charlotte News and the Asheville Citizen Times. That suprised me. Perry Morgan and Craig were pretty close from Craig&#x27;s days in Charlotte, I think was the reason. John Reynolds influenced the Citizen Times about it. Somebody in the crowd began taking sides and started making photocopies of the News and Observer articles and mailing them all out to the other newsapapers [laughter] . It just became the cause celebre all over the state. I had a  lot of fun with it because I got summoned to the legislature, not before any committees, but I tried to stay away from them unless I was called. I walked over there, and I just got buttonholed from one office to the other by everybody I saw—with overwhelming support for the position that I took in it. It startled me. I didn&#x27;t cause the uproar. It was the News and Observer that did it, and I do not know why because they later opposed me on nearly everything I did. Well, they opposed Tom 8, and they pushed him out, you know. 9 Tom Inman, editorial writer.  Well, Gill, finally, at our January meeting, decided this issue was too great to be settled without public airing. He thought the board should have a public hearing. I didn&#x27;t want it but we had to have it. It was over in the highway building, and we had it jam packed. There were legislators there and people from all over the state, all the colleges. NCAE were publicly opposing this but they were treading on thin ice, and they were doing it with some considerable reservation. We provided for—had to take an ad in the News and Observer to submit your position paper in writing, and request a certain time period, and the controller would handle it. You know, after that hearing, the thing was split almost fifty-fifty right down the middle—professional educators who opposed it and those who approved of it.  JAY JENKINS: Well, I&#x27;ll be dogged.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: That suprised me because I thought that it would be overwhelmingly approved. This guy from Chapel Hill who teaches at N. C. State—I can&#x27;t remember his name, had been on the environmental board, Jim Wallace, very outspoken, but very effective and persuasive—he came before that hearing. A lawyer there in Raleigh, who&#x27;s name is hard for me to remember, really did tear into Craig. Barton was presiding and had to call him down. I&#x27;ll say his name after a while. 9 10 Howard Manning.  It became obvious that the legislature would have to overrule the board, or the issue would never go away. So they got me to write a brief ammendment to the statutes saying that the standards for certification should not be less than they were on December 6, 1973 [laughter] or &#x27;72 in the event that the national  teachers&#x27; examination score was used, or provide some other test that we used, but it would not be less than the score that was … That&#x27;s still on the statutes. You know what happened then? This is critical, too. Bob Strother, who was the assistant state superintendent for public instruction under Craig Phillips, agreed with me and told Craig so. Bob was his liaison in Washington. Bob told me that he was in the office of the deputy attorney general—what was his name, was there one named Stanley Pottinger, or something like that? I forget what his name was.  JAY JENKINS: They turn over quite a bit.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I have his name in my file over there. He was on first name basis with the chief attorney general staff member in charge of the enforcement of desegregation. He had been liaison. He said this man showed him in a file a record of a telephome call when the legislature ruled against Craig on this issue. Craig called him and proposed that they bring suit against the state of North Carolina.  JAY JENKINS: The federal government?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yeah. And they did, alleging that the teachers&#x27; examination was racially discriminatory. The attorney general was to defend us, the state attorney general. Many, many sessions about that—I have a vast file of information on it. They sent their representatives down from the Justice Department to examine my personal files, three days on one occasion and two days, I believe it was, on another occasion. They went through every paper that I had, in these six hundred and eighty-five boxes, and I didn&#x27;t withhold anything from them. In fact, I went and found some letters I thought they might be especially interested in. One in particular was one I wrote to Graham Barden, my congressman, who was a gentleman of the old school and opposed the idea of integration, who signed the Southern Manifesto. You remember that?  JAY JENKINS: Yeah, I remember that.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I sort of followed the technique to agree with somebody—yes, but, so-and-so, you know, and not go into them belligerently. They used that letter, pulled it out, with a stack of other papers. They wanted to take them with them, but I wouldn&#x27;t agree. I said, &quot;You are free to copy them here. You can bring in the photocopier, but if you take them out of my files, I lose control of them. You have no right to do that without a court order, and I am not going to release them to you. You&#x27;re free to copy them here. You&#x27;re free to read them and take notes on them, but if they leave my place, I lose control of them. I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ll put in with them when they come back or what you take away. I don&#x27;t have copies of them.&quot; Ed Spees, the deputy attorney general, persuaded me to let him have custody of them. He took them to Raleigh and made copies, and he sent them back. I was supposed to stuff them in my old boxes. I never did do it. I found that was sort of rough treatment because I hadn&#x27;t done anything, from that point of view. I was…  JAY JENKINS: Trying to be helpful.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: You know that thing went to a three-judge District Court, and they ruled against it to start with. Then there was a Supreme Court decision about an examination for police that resulted in some racial discrimination in the view of those who brought the case. The court ruled that it was not discriminatory. Then the District Court changed its opinion and said that our policy was legal if we would have the scores verified by an independent professional group, which we did. We got all the schools of education together and the national teachers&#x27; examination people. The result was they said the score was too low. They validated the test. The court approved. It went to the Supreme Court after I had left office. Of course all the wind was out of the sails by that time, but the New and Observer carried a front page article written by a kid who had never heard of the previous controversy. It said Craig Phillips took credit for the decision of the court which upheld the state&#x27;s position [laughter]. I said, &quot;Well, this is not where I  came in, but this is a most interesting end to this whole controversy [laughter].   JAY JENKINS: [laughter] That&#x27;s a good story.   WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: You see those sixty-odd ring binders up there on the shelf? They&#x27;re a day by day chronicle of newspaper clippings and records of all the phone calls and the hairpulling and the lost hours of sleep on that particular issue. It probably is the most well documented controversy in the history of the state [laughter]. I did not give that collection to the archives. I showed it to  H.G. Jones 10 when he was down here. 11 Former head, Department of Archives and History. I said, &quot;I am tempted to burn this  thing, except that there&#x27;s something about it that reminds me of Adolf Hitler, and I don&#x27;t want to burn books.&quot; He said, &quot;It&#x27;s history. Don&#x27;t destroy it.&quot; I didn&#x27;t show it to the Department of Justice. I gave them five boxes and let them have a holiday with it, but I don&#x27;t know what to do with that yet. I&#x27;ve got it here close by, and once in awhile I read it.  JAY JENKINS: I&#x27;m sure somebody would like to have it.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Maybe the Southern Collection would like to have it.  JAY JENKINS: I&#x27;m sure they would.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: If I could be assured that no personal injury would come to anyone—I have nothing but the fondest attitude toward Craig. I understand his contribution has been substantial. I am not angry with him no matter how boyish he has been in his attitude toward me. I don&#x27;t carry any grudges. I don&#x27;t agree with him, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to fall out with him. I have not found a place to put it where I thought that kind of detached scholarly study of it would be…  JAY JENKINS: I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d like to have it over in Chapel Hill.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I have told the University at Wilmington that they could have my general files but not that. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do. We&#x27;ll see. I hope I have a few more years. I&#x27;m planning to live to the year 2000. I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ll make it or not.  JAY JENKINS: You look like you&#x27;ll make it, Dallas.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, when you have cancer you don&#x27;t know.  JAY JENKINS: Well, that&#x27;s true. Dallas, there&#x27;s one thing that I wish we could cover as we wind this up, and that is the curriculum study which is very important to the public schools in North Carolina.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yes. Didn&#x27;t we cover the fact that I went over to see Hodges after I&#x27;d served a couple of years on the Board of Education—about a year, I believe it was around? I wanted to resign. There was nothing going on that I was interested in. I didn&#x27;t feel we could get anything done there. I wanted to come back to Duplin where we were consolidating schools. I had been chairman of the board down here, and there was a vibrant movement, a grass roots movement, for reform in education. That&#x27;s what I wanted to be involved in, and here I was on the supreme court that talked about marshlands and Torrens proceedings, dealing with technical, piddling things. That just frustrated me altogether. I said, &quot;I understand exactly,&quot; and he said, &quot;Tell me more about what you&#x27;re doing in the school. You wrote an article in the Charlotte Observer about what we were doing down there. I&#x27;ve got the clipping.&quot; I told him, and he sat there spellbound. He put his hands down on his desk and told me to go back over there and make a proposal for what amounted to the Industrial Education Centers. I told him I was interested in excellence in education, the quality of education. I was tired of talking about teachers&#x27; salaries. I was tired of talking about need for new school buildings. Everybody knew we needed all of this. This is just the quantitative side of education, and I wanted to get to grips with the question of the quality of education. The idea of excellence is what interests me in the whole process. The housekeeping, the fiscal, the political part of it is necessary, but I don&#x27;t care for it. I mean I&#x27;m not excited about that. I&#x27;d rather be doing something that has some result in the opportunity that people have to get an education of real meaning. He agreed with me. He didn&#x27;t want it to cost too much, and he invited me to make two proposals. One I&#x27;ve already discussed with you, the Community College System. The other one was what to do about the condition of public school education. After thinking about it at some length and talking to Guy Phillips about it, who was appointed to the board by Hodges not long after that, I made a proposal to him that we establish a curriculum study. [Interruption]  This proposal was based on my experience with Conant&#x27;s group that we discussed earlier. What kind of curriculum do we have, actually? Not just in a general statewide statement, but what kind do we have in the Rose Hill High School? What kind do we have in the Edward&#x27;s High School in Asheville? What kind do we have in Central High School in Charlotte? What kind do we have in the Davidson High School in Davidson, North Carolina? By the way, my old Greek professor had been principal there, and I imagine it was a very good experience. It&#x27;s a very good question to ask. Then, who&#x27;s to say what kind of curriculum we need? There&#x27;s been all sorts of ideas about it. You have the strong advocacy of vocational education. They&#x27;ve felt themselves at war with people who taught English and taught history. There was a strong element in North Carolina, always has been, for the fine arts. A lot of talented people and a lot of people who appreciate talent even if they don&#x27;t have it themselves—hold in high esteem that creative spark that every human being has of some kind—and just pray for them an opportunity to develop that talent, whatever it is. So it&#x27;s hard to agree about the answer to that question. What constitutes the curriculum that we most desire? What is the kind that we agree we need? Then the question that we most often deal with, but without the thorough thinking on the first two that you should have, is how we want to get the curriculum we agree we need. We come up here with budgets that have much to do with the other two questions, but without the study that we need to have about where we are and where we need to go. Hodges said that makes sense. Of course it did. It&#x27;s a businessman&#x27;s idea about it. It&#x27;s not the American Management Associations&#x27; management by objectives where every Tom, Dick and Harry sets himself a personal goal. Lindbergh said &quot;I want to fly to Paris.&quot; Somebody else said, &quot;I want to go fishing.&quot; You see, that isn&#x27;t progress. It may have a place, but if you&#x27;re going to do things in society collectively, you&#x27;re going to have joint action toward the acheivement of the agreed goals. Somebody has to arrive at a consensus about it. You don&#x27;t take a handful of dictators or aristocrats or plutocrats or monarchs or dictators or whatever to establish it, but you put the people in a position where they have to decide for themselves. You know, the biggest problem is that they don&#x27;t do that unless somebody urges them. There are too many of them like the guy at the filling station in North Duplin who said he didn&#x27;t have any part in choosing the governor, those people in Baltimore picked the governor. I&#x27;m saying we can answer these questions in North Carolina. We can arrive at a concensus about it, and then we can have an important program, a concensus that we can act on. Most people say either the state decides or we decide locally. It&#x27;s state versus local argument all the time, eitheror proprosition. I say there&#x27;s a third option. The state should not and cannot wisely do this job alone. The local community cannot and should not do this job alone because there are such things such as statewide necessities, urgencies, exegencies, opportunities. So the state can create a situation where you reach a consensus of localities throughout the state. That&#x27;s the third option. And that, essentially, is what we went after in answering these three questions. We organized the citizens&#x27; committee movement in keeping with what Conant had advocated, and Roy Larsen and the others, especially John Hersey—whose friendship I value most highly and whose humanitarian commitment was very touching to me, very influential in my judgment. I found in reading Page—I tried to be a student of him all my life—that these were the ideas that he held out for North Carolina. He was blatant in his criticism of the state for failing to do it. He was so critical in writing his so-called mummy-letter, saying the leaders of North Carolina were mummies and satisfied to do nothing and be nothing, and all this young talent left the state or they stayed home and became alcoholics out of frustration. There was one who wrote him from Goldsboro, a young lawyer, and told him that he agreed with him, and he begged him to come back to North Carolina and join Josephus Daniels and the News and Observer and create a renaissance. That young man was Charles B. Aycock. I&#x27;ve not seen what Page wrote to Aycock about that, but these were brilliant earlier thinkers in our state, and they helped to bring about the renaissance. Our problem is to keep it on course today and keep ourselves philosophically in agreement with the democratic ideals that they had, and the realities that they brought about in keeping with that philosophy. Anybody can quote Aycock amd do his own thing. Anybody can do, innocently enough as Jim seems to me to be doing with the Carnegie group today—we&#x27;re going to go do the job because we know how to do it, and we&#x27;ll force it on them. The point is that they&#x27;re not going to bite. You have got to bring the people along with you. Well, I convinced Hodges of that, and he got the money from old man Smith Richardson to hire Epps Reedy and one assistant, fifty thousand dollars, big money in those days.  JAY JENKINS: What year was that? Do you remember?  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: &#x27;58 or &#x27;9. We set up the committee, the citizens&#x27; committee to work in conjuction with it. We employed Raymond Stone to go about canvassing the state, establishing citizens&#x27; committees. Well, we got a grass roots movement going there as a result of it. The time was right for it, Jay. The people were restive after the experience of the depression and the World War, and nothing happened for the improvement of education during that period. These young people had been all over the world. They had seen Europe and all of its greatness and all of its weakness. They&#x27;d seen the South Pacific. They&#x27;d seen the rise and fall of Japan. They were not willing to come back home to Rose Hill and do nothing. They were ready for some action. By the time of the end of the Hodges&#x27; administration, we had that movement going. People were going into the schoolhouses and looking at the physical plant and examining the faculty. The faculty was sitting there in the meetings with them. They were beginning to realize that the schools were too small to afford a decent curriculum—three and four and five teacher high schools where we ought to have at least a thousand students together to have a minimum curriculum. So they didn&#x27;t wait for solutions. They didn&#x27;t wait for legislation. They began pounding on the doors demanding consolidation of schools that a few months before they would have fought to the death to preserve, because they were the local community&#x27;s last link to culture. I traveled that route, too. I was mayor of Rose Hill, and I didn&#x27;t want us to lose our school. But it was just one step to broaden it to include the next community and say we could have a better school if you join us than either of us can have separately. I remember one year we consolidated fifty-five high schools across the state as a result of political action—maybe it&#x27;s not correct to say political action—citizens&#x27; action locally generated.  JAY JENKINS: The study showed up the deficiencies in the curriculum, and they realized they couldn&#x27;t do it alone.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: That&#x27;s right. It covered the whole curriculum. It did not include just the primary school—the lack of kindergardens, the neglect of the humanities—it included all, also vocation. It was a well-rounded comprehensive program that we reached a consensus about. We had a central committee, and we had committees from the colleges and universities as well as representatives from the public school system to deal with the question of what constitutes a good curriculum in the English language; what constitutes a good curriculum in French, Spanish, German, foreign languages. Not whether we should have it available, but what it constitutes. For example, what is the methodology of foreign language instruction today. When I studied it, it was the old fashioned grammar approach. You learn all the grammar, the mechanics, the conjugation, the inflection of the language, the sentence order, syntax, and then begin to learn a vocabulary. They discovered that the best way to learn even an ancient language is the way the child learns his native tongue. He learns to speak it. So they set up language laboratories with the tape recorders and practiced that way so you got a feel for the language. You begin to think in the language, and then you dealt with the incorrect sentence structure and pronunciation and grammar as you went along. Now after fifty years, I retain a great deal of German grammar but I&#x27;ve lost my vocabulary because I never spoke it. We just were not taught to speak it. We were taught to read it, and you read what somebody else is saying, not what you would say. I have a friend over here who is a retired German theologian. He moved here from Germany, from Heidelberg I think, and he comes to see me once in awhile. I&#x27;ll recite some German poetry, and he says I have a beautiful pronunciation but I have to struggle to remember what the words mean. If I could deal with him every day, I would learn the language quite readily I think, but I can&#x27;t do that. Now back to the point. This fervor created all over the state simply because we opened the door for democratic participation. It was not the united forces for education in Raleigh saying we need a fifteen percent increase for teachers. We need more instructional material. We need better school buildings. We need more school busses. All this () that the elite used to decide and hand it out for the grass roots to support. This is quite a different thing. We asked the grass roots to tell us what we needed, and then we began to get action. Terry Sanford, who was in the 1953 session of the general assembly, did not lift his hand to help education or to hurt it. He was indifferent to it, according to his own account of it. I appeared before that session to present the united forces program during the Umstead administration. After I got on the board of education, I presented our findings. When Sanford began to run for governor and began to consider that, and he saw this awakening of the grass roots of North Carolina during the time when most of the south was involved with the struggle whether to close the schools rather than integrate or to integrate here. You know what this problem was. They were closing the schools in the Farmville, Virginia, area, and we were talking about improving the curriculum in the schools. I don&#x27;t mean we didn&#x27;t have problems. We did have problems. But we were thinking positively about it too. Not only the leadership, but the people at large, dearly loved the schools and wanted the opportunities to be preserved, black and white, whether it meant schools separately or together. Terry was astute enough to see this. I don&#x27;t mean that he didn&#x27;t have a sincere committment or that he was being—simply being opportunistic. He was genuinely committed to the cause, but he did see, being the good politician that he was also, that here was the ideal issue. Look at the opposition that he had. He had John Larkins, who was a long time political activist in the state, an old school conservative. Whoever would have thought that John Larkins would be the main spring behind the forced integration of the schools in North Carolina [laughter]. In the days of Greg Cherry and Mel Broughton 11, you would not have dared to think such a  thing. 12 Governors. Yet he did  that.  JAY JENKINS: As a federal judge.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: As a federal judge. I guess the justice department told him what he had to say. I don&#x27;t know [laughter]. At any rate, Terry had to beat John Larkins and Malcolm Seawell  and Beverly Lake. At any rate, he won. Terry is not a very forceful public speaker, not awfully inspiring. He&#x27;s not the kind of public speaker like Adalai Stevenson who&#x27;d get you to get up and walk down the sawdust trail. But he was able to get across the point that he was sincere and genuinely interested in what he was talking about and intended to do something about it. He was the voice of moderation, and competence, and positive, and kept saying over and over again that we have to think positively. I thought I&#x27;d die if he didn&#x27;t quit saying it [laughter]. Let&#x27;s just do it and not say it, you know? But he did  succeed by the nape of his neck and got a new day in. I believe that the curriculum study had as much to do with it, his success …  JAY JENKINS: It prepared the atmosphere.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Well, it was especially pertinent there in those times when there were so many negative pressures going. There were a lot of people in North Carolina who were so angry over the treatment they had gotten by the courts that they would have said, &quot;Well, to hell with it, I&#x27;m going to start my own schools with my own kids.&quot; A lot of them did that and are still doing it today. It took the cream of the leadership off the top of the pile. It hurt the public schools, and it still hurts. But it could have been a whole lot worse.  JAY JENKINS: It certainly could have.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I say it isn&#x27;t. A lot of people expected that we would come up with a big report as most commissions usually do and put it on the shelf and let it gather dust. This is what we should do, and this is the kind of curriculum we ought to have. Well, we had some reports, but the main contribution of that effort was that it involved the people democratically and gave them an opportunity to have an effect on the quality of education, and they did do so. That essentially is the story. In 1965 when Governor Moore came in, the legislature cut the money out of the curriculum study altogether and it ended. He did not call us over to say, &quot;Look, is this doing anything good; has this resulted in any improvement?&quot; You know how these things happen in the sub-subcommittee, and it just got cut out. I don&#x27;t know who cut it out. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been any doctoral dissertations or interviews about it. It just stopped. It was a severe blow to me but I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. Governor Moore was not following through with the citizens&#x27; committee, and it just died because this was a Sanford and Hodges&#x27; program. With all due respect to Governor Moore, he was a judge. He was not an executive. Judges don&#x27;t do anything. They just flip the coin and decide who&#x27;s right. He didn&#x27;t perceive it as his duty. I told you about his statement, &quot;Well, gentlemen, it&#x27;s your problem, and the justice department!&quot; [Laughter] Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I have a great deal of  respect for Judge Moore. I think he was a man of ability. He was a victim of his own profession, is what I&#x27;m saying.  JAY JENKINS: Temperament.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Yeah, temperament, approach to things. Perfectly legitimate, I suppose, in his field, to have the antagonist and the protagonist, and then all he has to do is decide.  JAY JENKINS: I think I ought to put into the record what Governor Sanford said about you. He said Dallas Herring is the most eloquent spokesman for education in North Carolina in the twentieth century.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: I don&#x27;t feel very eloquent. I feel inadequate for that statement about me.  JAY JENKINS: Well, as I did before, I thank you again, when you aren&#x27;t feeling very well, for submitting to a second interview.  WILLIAM DALLAS HERRING: Delighted to have you always, Jay. Wish you&#x27;d come by every Saturday.  JAY JENKINS: Thank you very much. This is the end of part number two of the Dallas Herring interview.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>George Watts Hill, born in 1903, spent most of his childhood growing up in Durham, North Carolina. In 1918, Hill attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He describes what life was like in that college community during the early twentieth century. Hill left UNC in 1924 after finishing both a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a law degree. After his marriage and subsequent ten-month honeymoon trip through parts of Asia and Europe in 1925, Hill returned to Durham, determined to continue in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, both of whom had by that time become pillars of the business community in Durham. Hill describes how his family was responsible for the building of two hospitals in Durham and his father had begun to make a name for himself in banking, have established the Durham Loan and Trust Company (which later became Central Carolina Bank). Because of his perspective from a position of business leadership, Hill is able to offer a unique description of the development of Durham as a center of commerce during the early twentieth century. He describes the roles of various leaders in the area, such as C. C. Spaulding and members of the Duke family, and he discusses the impact of the tobacco and textile industries on the community&#x27;s growth. During the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s he pursued various business endeavors, notably in insurance and banking. He helped to found various insurance organizations in Durham, paving the way for the establishment and growth of North Carolina Blue/Cross Blue Shield. Simultaneously, he worked with his father to build their banking enterprises, and when the stock market crashed in 1929, they were in a position to offer loans to smaller banks, thus ensuring their economic survival. During World War II, Hill left North Carolina in order to work for the Office of Strategic Services. When he returned in 1945, he picked up his business endeavors where he had left off. To those efforts he added further forays into land and business development. During the 1950s, he was a prominent figure in the development and rapid growth of the Research Triangle Park. In addition, he tried his hand at dairy farming. Throughout the interview, Hill focuses on descriptions of business leadership and formulas for economic success. In addition, he addresses such issues as balancing work and family, the importance of public service (such as his work with the UNC Board of Trustees), and changing ways of life in Durham and its surrounding areas.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  JAMES LEUTZE: Maybe we&#x27;ll start with your career at the University of North Carolina and what Chapel Hill was like in the years that you were there right after World War I.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: It wasn&#x27;t until &#x27;53 or &#x27;55 that I was elected to the board of trustees, I don&#x27;t remember exactly.  JAMES LEUTZE: No, I want to deal with your college days.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, college.  JAMES LEUTZE: Let&#x27;s start there.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Have to go back a little bit further. Billy Carmichael and myself were in the same class, 1917, at Durham High School. His wife was also, May. And I was the third man scholastically in class, a preacher and a teacher&#x27;s son beat me out. I was sixteen and I gave Billy Carmichael my scholarship to Chapel Hill so he was a class ahead of me, class of &#x27;21, I was &#x27;22 at Chapel Hill. I went on to Hotchkiss Prep School. Tore my knee all to hell playing football up there because I weighed 175 pounds and I as tall as I am now. They didn&#x27;t move me, I played tackle. I kept that side of the line; I made the team. My grandfather had been a great friend of old Dr. Beelor, the headmaster, and that&#x27;s why I went to Hotchkiss. And it made sense. My boys went to Millbrook School, Connecticut where we again knew the headmaster very well, and my grandsons went to Millbrook. The thought of a southerner going north to prep school made sense to me because then they came back and graduated at Chapel Hill, as I did, in the class of &#x27;22.  JAMES LEUTZE: But scholastically, you were third in your class. Why did you go to Hotchkiss for more academic preparation?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My father and mother thought I was too young to come to Chapel Hill and meet all the problems that were involved—women and gambling and all the rest of the stuff. [laughter] I was a good young boy and an only son, I had two younger  sisters—now Mrs. DuBose and Mrs. Foxl. I came over to Chapel Hill. I spent three months in a hospital in New York and in Durham and that&#x27;s where my hospital interest started.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was this because of your knee?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Because of my knee. And they did not operate in those days but they put me in what they call counter irritation. They put me with towels from waist down and put me in a bake oven, and then they&#x27;d throw me in an ice cold shower, and I&#x27;d faint. Then the nurse said, &quot;Aw, to hell with it,&quot; and she took off her clothes and came on in there with me.  JAMES LEUTZE: You didn&#x27;t faint!  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, I didn&#x27;t faint that time. [laughter] But I had a lovely little nurse, Miss Stancel, I  remember—it&#x27;s funny how these things come back—that always kissed me good morning and kissed me good-night. I was a youngster, and she was the head nurse, Canadian. [laughter] Such was life! And I was in the old Poly Clinic Hospital in New  York during the very cold winter, so cold that we were without coal in the hospital for a week and I could look out the window and see the coal trucks crossing the Hudson River to Jersey.  JAMES LEUTZE: This would have been the winter of 1917?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: &#x27;17. And then I came to Chapel Hill the fall of &#x27;18 and graduated in the class of 1922. That was during the war, and I lived at Mrs. Battle&#x27;s boarding house where the eastern portion of the Ackland Museum is, as a freshman. And then I had cottages in various and sundry places. John Shaw of Charlotte took me under his wing. And I had a little cottage, near the Coop; I ran the damn thing for two years, got my meals free.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now is Cooup, spelled c-o-o-u-p as in …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: C-double o-p.  JAMES LEUTZE: C-double o-p.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And I had a very big cook, I forget his name, a little bitty Henry and the cook, and we fed the boys, there were two cabins there. Then I ran the SAE house, I built it. That was the second house, the SAE fraternity; my father had built the first one which was on the campus to the west of the present library, the Deke house, and then the SAE house. And that burned.  JAMES LEUTZE: The first house burned?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Dad built it when he was here in college, he was the class of &#x27;89, I think. And I built the present fraternity house, it&#x27;s still there. The first one in the original fraternity court. It&#x27;s a disgrace now, I understand.  JAMES LEUTZE: It&#x27;s in pretty bad repair. I want to talk about the atmosphere at Chapel Hill at that time. But, what about the atmosphere in the country in 1917, 1918? How did young men like you feel about the war, what the country was doing?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I was disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t participate in the war, too young, but at Chapel Hill I was a member of Captain Allen, as I remember, the Canadian, the non-SATC boys.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK, you&#x27;re going to have to explain that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Student Army Training Corps, or something like that.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did they have an ROTC?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: All the campus, all the dormitories were barracks. And the students were not permitted to go off campus. Those were all members of the SATC, Victor Bryant was one of the head ones. George Denney was the captain in our non-SATC. You remember George?  JAMES LEUTZE: Uh-huh (affirmative)   GEORGE WATTS HILL: And I was number two in the group and we as non-SATC had the run of the campus. I started, as I remember, the selling of apples and other things on the campus to the boys who were in barracks and couldn&#x27;t go downtown.  JAMES LEUTZE: So now, these were men who were in military training.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: They were in military training. Luther Hodges was here; Victor Bryant was here. And they went on to Plattsburg and got their officer position. I remember November 1918 when the war was over, Pass Farrington who became a doctor in Winston-Salem, a fraternity-mate, friend, came running across the campus from South Building without a damn stitch on. &quot;Weeeeeeee, the war is over, the war is over!&quot; [laughter]   JAMES LEUTZE: Now, the non-SATC, you did military training of some nature, is that right?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, we had far greater military training than the boys in the barracks in SATC because there were about 150 of us or something. That was real training.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you march?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, hell, yeah. We had some false guns, wooden ones, that looked like guns but some of the boys on campus had real rifles. And the Emerson Stadium was there, that was before 1926, I think it was, when they built the new one. Mother was a Grey Lady; she organized the Grey Ladies in Durham. Everything was gung ho for the war. As I remember, when I graduated in &#x27;22 there were only 2300 students here. There was a lesser number back in &#x27;18.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was there pacifism on campus?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, not the slightest. Everybody was gung ho, going to Europe.  JAMES LEUTZE: Very patriotic.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, hell, yeah, no question about it.  JAMES LEUTZE: How did you feel about President Wilson, for instance, in a specific sense?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, I don&#x27;t remember any thought one way or the other.  JAMES LEUTZE: How about about the issue of the League of Nations? Was that a topic?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Nobody gave a damn.  JAMES LEUTZE: Nobody cared about that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We were going to go to fight. Period.  JAMES LEUTZE: So were you disappointed in a sense when the war was over and you were cheated?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yes and no. We didn&#x27;t know what we were doing to ourselves.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, did you know people like Sam Ervin? Did you have friends who were participating in the conflict?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, yeah. I knew Sam and a lot of the old—well, there were a lot of older boys that were seniors and so on. Hell, I was a damn little freshman. But I had to behave myself.  JAMES LEUTZE: Alright, what about the atmosphere on campus at this time? What was Chapel Hill like?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Franklin Street was unpaved; there was no asphalt. The Pickwick Theater was there and you had to be careful, you had to sit in the back of it because if you sat even three rows down somebody&#x27;d hit you with raw peanuts on the back of the head. Franklin Street—that&#x27;s about all there was to Chapel Hill, as I remember. Collier-Cobb and all that crowd. We went downtown, walked the streets as they still do, but there wasn&#x27;t much to it. Old Mr. Durham had an automobile, I forget his first name. And he used to drive us to Durham. We had a hell of a time getting back and forth. The train ran to the station out in Carrboro and you could take the train and go to University Station and come back. Well, that was a hell of a mess. Well, you stayed on campus, you just didn&#x27;t run around.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, if I remember correctly, the first women came to campus in 1921 or &#x27;22. Is that correct?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: There was, yeah. Jonathan Daniels and I started out together in the same class, but Jonathan was smarter than I and graduated in three years: Howard Patterson the same way; he was smarter, though he graduated in 1921, Jonathan in 1921. I was football manager so I had a lot of other fish to fry, fraternity and so forth, and I didn&#x27;t take my studies too seriously one way or the other. What did we start on?  JAMES LEUTZE: On women.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The first woman was admitted to the campus in the early &#x27;20s.  JAMES LEUTZE: Right, I think it was &#x27;21.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Jonathan and I had a vote on the campus. We ran the vote and it was against co-education and the next day the trustees, my father, Josephus Daniels and old Judge Parker, I remember, were members of the board executive committee. They approved women coming to the campus and the first woman admitted was a Chapel Hill girl. I don&#x27;t remember her name but she was not particularly impressive from a looks standpoint or action, a great big woman, I remember. Terrible, terrible. And from then on, slowly, they were limited at first to Chapel Hill residents and then the door opened.  JAMES LEUTZE: Why did you not want to see it co-educational? I would think boys would want to have girls on campus.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, we weren&#x27;t interested in women to start with, and we liked what we had. I can&#x27;t give you any other reason.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK. Well, what things were you interested in? Obviously, sports were a big part of life, and fraternities were a big part of life.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Fraternities were a big part. There were fraternities and non-fraternities. And the non-fraternities were strong. I can remember going down to Battle or Ehringhaus or whatever the damn three dormitories down on Franklin Street were called. Sam Caffey and Mary Worsham were blind and we&#x27;d go down there and read to them, read their lesson to them—they lived there. We just didn&#x27;t go off campus except to Franklin Street and I used to take boys home to Durham and mother always was happy to have somebody come over for supper or something like that and she called us &quot;some awful eaters.&quot; [laughter] And I called them &quot;soused after light.&quot; But  you carry me way back, God knows.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, did people put much emphasis on academics at that time? You said you had lots of other fish to fry.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I don&#x27;t remember particularly one way or the other. They put emphasis on athletics. Basketball didn&#x27;t amount to too much and then again it did. Billy Carmichael, Sis Parry, and so forth, that was before Cartwright, the younger brother, came into the picture, a beautiful player. Billy was beautiful and it was just lovely to watch him. He used to play in the old Bynum gym. And we got up in the gallery, the track was up there. That&#x27;s where we had our dances. And the social life was very important and we used to bring girls in later. They stayed with Mrs. Klutz, which is now a fraternity house on Franklin Street, a sorority house. And I remember vividly as a senior, I had an old automobile. I brought down a girl from Asheville, a great lovely looking gal, and I was engaged at that time to Mrs. Hill. At law school. We went to the fall dance and, this girl I had invited before I met Anne to the dance, she came to the dance and she said, &quot;Yes, I see what has happened.&quot; [laughter] But, such is life. No, we paid a lot of attention to the dances,  the German Club, and the Fall German and the Spring German, got all dressed up. The girls had one spot and the boys went to the girls instead of the way it is now where one boy and girl dance all night. We just mixed the deal.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, who were your great athletic rivals at that point?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Virginia, because it was before the days of Duke.  JAMES LEUTZE: Duke doesn&#x27;t come until &#x27;23, I guess it is.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And when Duke finally came into the picture we kind of looked down our noses. We went over to play on the old field. Duke was young.  JAMES LEUTZE: But Virginia was the …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Virginia was—no question there—the big game. As I remember, Virginia was turned down by the faculty here because Johnson was on the Carolina team, played half-back, Runt Lowe, and God knows who, Bill Blount, and so forth, you remember. You know of Bill, went on to be president and chairman of Liggett &amp; Myers. The game was called off. So a bunch of us got together and we brought Reinhart and the Virginia team down to Chapel Hill.  JAMES LEUTZE: You mean independently?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, hell yeah. And we had the game, and I remember sitting on the grass as manager. I had the receipts and so forth, and I remember sitting on the ground with two tin boxes full of money and counting. What was it—$16,000 or something like that? And Carolina beat Virginia 7 to nothing.  JAMES LEUTZE: Would people travel between the campuses? Would they go up to Virginia for the Virginia game and Virginia students come down here?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, yeah.  JAMES LEUTZE: That must have been quite a haul from Charlottesville at that time.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, it was terrible, terrible. No question. By automobile.  JAMES LEUTZE: Or train, I guess on a train to Danville, Virginia, and then on up to Charlottesville.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Sure, sure. Take the old Southern. We&#x27;d go to Greensboro and go up on the Southern.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what about some of the old professors that were here? Do you remember some of your professors and the people who …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, very, very, well. Dr. Drew Patterson (I was just a member of the Patterson family) Mary Patterson, Howard of course, and they lived down on—hard to believe—corner on Franklin Street and Hillsborough. And I was in and out of there all the time. That group of four boys, took very handsome girls down to Bynum for a week-end. We had two canoes and four horses, three horses, or something. That was the time we were seniors; that was the old days. That was really a party.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now just one thing about parties. If you&#x27;ll excuse me, in some ways life in those days sounds very unsophisticated in modern terms.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I&#x27;d say so. We had fraternity parties and there was nothing untoward about them at all.  JAMES LEUTZE: Were they chaperoned?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, hell, yes, of course. You took that for granted. And there was no monkey-business or foolishness at all in those days.  JAMES LEUTZE: How about drinking? Was there a lot of drinking?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I remember hiring a cook by the little old cottage that I had that the four of us lived in in my sophomore year: Bill Guthrie and Emerson Tucker, John Shaw from Charlotte. And I remember Emerson Tucker from Durham, and Guthrie from Durham, getting drunk, and I remember chasing Tucker all over the campus because he said something I didn&#x27;t like and I couldn&#x27;t catch him. But he was drunk. And John and I did not drink, period; we never thought about drinking.  JAMES LEUTZE: Some people did.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah. And I can remember Rick running into the fraternity house and standing there on the bottom of the steps (the stairway coming down), and knocking the hell out of anybody coming down the stairs drunk. He beat the hell out of them. I&#x27;d just knock them down. That&#x27;s the way we controlled drinking.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what about the university acting as some gauge of morality as far as the students were concerned? Did the university make any attempt in religious or other things to … ?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I don&#x27;t remember any. No, the university ran itself. South Building. President Chase, long, tall, very distinguished man, and Charlie Woolen, business manager, he was the one I worked with as football sub-assistant, assistant and as manager.  JAMES LEUTZE: Is that Woolen of Woolen Gym? Is that where that comes from?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah. Charlie Woolen and for many years I remember, oh yeah. And we used to take the football team to Yale every September on the train.  JAMES LEUTZE: That would be a big trip.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: That was overnight. We&#x27;d get up there and they&#x27;d beat the hell out of us. That was in the days that Yale had a real football team. And I don&#x27;t know why we went up there. And we went to New Orleans one year, played Tulane. But the rest of the time it was around here.  JAMES LEUTZE: That brings up an interesting point. What was the image that you had of the university at that time? In other words, today, I mean, sometimes you hear &quot;The University of North Carolina: The Harvard of the South.&quot; Did you look on yourself as an academic equal of places like Yale?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. Never thought about it. We just went to class. And we went to class, I don&#x27;t know when the kids go to college anymore? I have a step-daughter in Greensboro, a junior, she&#x27;s coming home tonight. She&#x27;ll be here &#x27;til Sunday night, through Sunday night. She goes back to Greensboro early Monday morning. To hell with it!  JAMES LEUTZE: You had classes on Saturday.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, sure. We started at eight o&#x27;clock and we went through, lab in the afternoon, and you finished up three to five o&#x27;clock and classes until twelve o&#x27;clock on Saturday. Sure, never thought about it otherwise. You worked like hell.  JAMES LEUTZE: But you didn&#x27;t really concern yourself about the national ranking of the university.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, never thought about it or gave a damn. There were only the three institutions at the time—Chapel Hill, Greensboro (and Greensboro was full of women and nobody paid any attention to it), and State College, oh we looked down our noses at State.  JAMES LEUTZE: As a technical school? Was that how it was viewed?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, that was a &quot;cow college&quot; and dairy and what have you. And, oh, Chapel Hill was way up above them, no question about it. We played State in football because we had to. I don&#x27;t remember the university administration participating, getting in the way of the school or the students getting in the way of the university, faculty.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what about compulsory chapel, though? Wasn&#x27;t there compulsory chapel at that time?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, sure, sure. Several times a week as I remember and it slowly petered out, eventually, after I left college.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you take chapel seriously?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, it was just one of those things you had to do. You didn&#x27;t worry about it.  JAMES LEUTZE: Alright, now your degree was in …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: A B.S. in commerce.  JAMES LEUTZE: Commerce. What was a commerce degree like?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: That was the second [interruption] . Dr. Dudley Carroll was the head man in the School of Business,  and we were the second class, as I remember, to graduate. We had courses under Collier-Cobb, in geology, that was a &quot;fool&quot; course, as we called it; I mean, a very easy course.  JAMES LEUTZE: A &quot;slide,&quot; we would call it.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: When I was football manager, I attended two classes in geology and passed the course. I was football manager, what did they know? [laughter] That was Collier-Cobb. &quot;What we are mainly because of  where we are.&quot; You&#x27;re bringing me back. Dudley Carroll used to say, &quot;Well, now, gentlemen,&quot; it slipped me. He&#x27;d ask the questions in the fall and we would answer them; he&#x27;d ask us in the winter and we&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, that all depends, Dr. Carroll.&quot; And he&#x27;d answer us &quot;That all depends,&quot; and we gave it back to him, made him awful mad. He lived down on Laurel Hill Drive, right around the corner.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, did you have a sense at that time that you wanted to go into business? Was that clear to you that that&#x27;s what you wanted to do?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah. After my hospitalization, I became very much interested in medicine. I used to stand on crutches and watch operations.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, this was when you came from Hotchkiss, right?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, when I came back from Hotchkiss. I used to go watch the doctor&#x27;s operate.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you know that you wanted to go in business and you referred to the fact that you had been in the hospital and so on.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I developed an interest in medicine. My grandfather had built a hospital back in &#x27;95 and rebuilt it in 1907. My father was president.  JAMES LEUTZE: This is a philosophical question in a sense having to do with philanthropic activity, why did he build a hospital?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: His wife had all kinds of troubles, kidney troubles, nephritis, cystitis, God knows what all else. And she went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. He was born and raised in Baltimore. She was from Hagerstown. And his father was the first wholesaler of Bull Durham tobacco. He came down here in &#x27;75 and became the secretary-treasurer to W. Duke, Sons, and they added &quot;and Company&quot; for him. Old man Wash Duke, Ben, and Buck Duke. He owned a fourth of the old American Tobacco Trust and got out in 1913 so he wouldn&#x27;t have to go to jail under the Sherman Antitrust Law.  JAMES LEUTZE: It was broken up at that point.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: That&#x27;s right. When it was broken back into its component parts. He built it because there was no hospital in Durham, for one thing. He built it where McPherson Hospital is today, and the central building is now on Buchanan Boulevard, been moved back down there. And there was a central building and two wings and a little surgery. It was a pest house in the minds of people in Durham and it took a long time, some years, before people would use it.  JAMES LEUTZE: You said a pest house; how do you mean? You mean a place they didn&#x27;t want to go in a sense?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: People didn&#x27;t want to go to the hospital. And I say advisedly a pest house. It was a place where, if you had a bad disease or something, you went to die. Period. And old Dr. Carr, A. G. Carr, was their doctor and he was very instrumental in bringing the hospital into being. My grandfather built it, ran it, endowed it, and, you go back and look in the records as I did: thousand dollar debts, ten thousand dollar debts. Hell, that&#x27;s all there was to it. Eventually it became the public hospital and he built another one in 1907. He built the Watts Hospital which is now the School of Science and Math. My father built it, my grandfather paid for it: the administration building, the surgery and one ward building. Men on one floor, women on the other; eventually another ward building was built. When he died, (was it &#x27;21 or something like that?) he left money for the Private Patient Pavilion which I built. I&#x27;d gotten into the hospital business by that time.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, was this done out of a sense of social responsibility? Why would he?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My father walked in the office one day. I went to work in 1925 in my father&#x27;s office, $250 a month; I lived on the corner of Jackson and Morehead. Negroes lived behind me. Ablekopf lived in a little store in front.  JAMES LEUTZE: Ablekopf?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Isidore Ablekopf. Great friend of mine. His father ran a little grocery store on the northeast corner of Morehead Avenue (you know where that is?) and Jackson Street, which is one street over to the east from Duke Street. And we lived where the highrise is today on Duke Street. And the Lyons lived on the corner of Morehead and Duke. We lived this side of it, in the old house that had belonged to my grandfather. It had been built in 1875 when he came down here. When he rebuilt the &quot;pink elephant&quot; as I called the tremendous house that he built on the hill. It had been moved down wall by wall because they didn&#x27;t know how to move a whole house. It had been rebuilt on the property when we came down from New York in 1903 or &#x27;04, or something like that. We moved into this house, my mother, eventually my sisters, and me.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now I was asking you about the question of social responsibility.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I was the only son. I had this interest in medicine, as I say. But there wasn&#x27;t anything for me to do but go to work, go into business. Period.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now did your father impress that on you?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. That was my decision. He owned the then Durham Loan and Trust Company and the Home Savings Bank, where Guaranty Bank is now. He had started Durham Loan and Trust Company when he came from New York. I went into the bank in 1925 without a title. It had a million and a quarter total resources. It&#x27;s hard to believe. He owned the, when I say he owned, he was by far the majority stockholder, he owned the Home Savings Bank, which I combined with the Trust Company, by then, in 1931. When he came down from New York he went to Mr. Pierce, who was the then cashier and said he had bought the Home Savings Bank. And Pierce said, &quot;You see the sidewalk out there? Well, you ought to go out there and lose your lunch because it&#x27;s busted.&quot; It was busted. It was a million and a half and all the big guns, Lindsay and Carr and so forth, had borrowed all the money and hadn&#x27;t paid it back. So he went to work and made them pay. And eventually, it was a going bank. We combined it. We had the bank holiday in &#x27;31.  JAMES LEUTZE: Alright, well, I&#x27;ve lost a couple of years in your life here. Now, you graduated from college in 1922.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I took two years law and I graduated Chapel Hill and I was the youngest man in my class. And I never thought about it one way or the other. I missed Phi Beta Kappa because I busted the hell out of accounting. [laughter] One course I failed and then I went ahead and passed it. Brother  Peacock was the teacher.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, you obviously were intelligent enough to pass the course. You obviously don&#x27;t have too much trouble dealing with the figures. Why did you fail the course?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Then I studied law because my father was a lawyer. And I wanted the law. And as I said, I passed the bar in August, I didn&#x27;t have but a two-year course.  JAMES LEUTZE: So that&#x27;s August of &#x27;24.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I went through the summer school in law and passed the bar. I was the second man to leave the law exam in the old Supreme Court building and I thought I&#x27;d busted the hell out of it. But I went on to Asheville, I caught the sleeper to Ashville, I was engaged by that time, and I told my wife-to-be when I got there, I said, &quot;I busted the hell out of it.&quot; She said, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to get married September the 24th, the invitations are out, already engraved,&quot; in those days. And I said, &quot;Well.&quot; It was not in the actual paper the morning that I arrived in Asheville. My name was not there.  JAMES LEUTZE: On the list of those who had passed, you mean?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Uh-huh (affirmative). So finally I had sense enough to call the News and Observer in Raleigh. Mr. Daniels was still the head of it, as I remember. Frank was running it. And they said they had not published the names west of Greensboro, but I had passed. So we got married.  JAMES LEUTZE: So did you practice law?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: $52 and a half. I quit.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now what does that mean? You&#x27;re going to have to explain that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I collected one note for $400, I won&#x27;t tell you the name. The note was past due. The statute of limitations had run against it and I wrote one letter and collected the $400 note from a man and I charged him $52 and a half. Period. That was the extent of my law practice. [laughter]   JAMES LEUTZE: That was enough for you.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Got married.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK. Now, you got married in …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: September 24, 1924.  JAMES LEUTZE: &#x27;24. That was in Asheville? Did you get married in Asheville?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, it was in Baltimore because she was the daughter of the Reverend Duncan McCullouch who owned Oldfield School for Girls, one of the great old girls&#x27; schools, and it&#x27;s still a non-coeducational, still a girls&#x27; school, thereby hangs a looonnngggg [laughter] history!   JAMES LEUTZE: So you were married in Baltimore?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: In Baltimore. And I remember the church vividly. It was an Episcopal church and it had flags on both sides of the chancel all the way down, all the way through. It was beautiful. It looked like old European.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, were you an Episcopalian?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Presbyterian. Congenital Presbyterian. My grandfather had come down here as a Lutheran and there was no Lutheran church so he went into the Presbyterian church, the nearest thing to it. And he became ruling elder for 25 years, and Superintendent of the Sunday school for 25 years; a great churchman. And my father followed him as eventually an elder. And I declined to be elder because I wanted to take a drink. [laughter] So I served as a deacon.   JAMES LEUTZE: You should have been an Episcopalian. Then you wouldn&#x27;t have had to worry about it.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I married two Episcopalians.  JAMES LEUTZE: So this was the Baltimore of H. L. Mencken at this point, a very aristocratic community, with many German-Americans represented in Baltimore at that time, and a sophisticated community. Was it not?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, Baltimore was a very sophisticated place. That was before all the development that Rouse did down in the harbor and so forth. My grandfather&#x27;s family lived out at Catonville, out on the southwest suburb of Baltimore; had a farm. I remember as a kid going up there. Watts Carr, Sr. used to go up there every summer. I went there as a kid twelve, thirteen. And they had Guernsey cows, had a very fine herd of Guernsey cows, where I fell in love with the Guernseys.  JAMES LEUTZE: I was going to say. That&#x27;s where the Quail Roost Guernsey herd has its origins.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I brought some of the three titters and one-eyed cows down from up there at the time of the dispersal sale.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, where did you meet your wife? Your wife is from Baltimore, you&#x27;re from …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My sister and my wife and Margaret Carr, Claiborne Carr&#x27;s daughter, granddaughter of old General Carr, thereby hangs a tale. He was corporal in the Army, the Confederate Army, and he came home and declared himself to be a general. And he was known as General Carr from then on.  JAMES LEUTZE: I thought people just claimed they were colonels?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Don&#x27;t you put that in the transcript!  JAMES LEUTZE: No.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: But, you ought to know that. But they all were—Marcia Davenport, the writer—they were all members of the senior class at Shipley School, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. You&#x27;ve heard of Shipley School?  JAMES LEUTZE: Oh, yes.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And my sister must have had, or some of the girls claimed that she had, trouble getting a beau for the spring dances, so she invited her brother. I went up there. God knows when that was; that was &#x27;23, I reckon. And I went there and we had two dances, card dances in those days. Two dances with the gal—Anne McCullouch—who became my wife. I caught the milk train out of Philadelphia down here and went to class the next morning and she was invited home in Durham by my sister immediately after Christmas. So she came down. We were engaged ten days later and I said, I remember vividly, what I said, I asked her to marry me and she was &quot;so and so,&quot; and I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll give &#x27;til tomorrow. I&#x27;m going to put you on a train tomorrow night for Baltimore,&quot; where her home was, out in the country, &quot;and I want to know by tomorrow.&quot; Period. So I found out later that she sat up all that night and talked with my sister&#x27;s governess and told me the next morning that she would marry me.  JAMES LEUTZE: Let me ask you a personal question about yourself. That implies a certain amount of … what term do I want to use? … of decisiveness on your part. In other words, it didn&#x27;t take you very long to make up your mind and then when you made up your mind you wanted an answer. Would you describe yourself as a decisive person? Is that a secret to your success in a way? Or a secret to your personality?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, yeah. I&#x27;ve been that way all my life, I reckon.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK, so you make up your mind what you want and you go out and get it. And that&#x27;s it.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah. Sure. No need fiddling about it. I have no stress. I learned a long time ago my present wife is stressful, things bother her, she&#x27;s much younger, she&#x27;s 57 or 58 or something, her second marriage and my second marriage, but she gets all tied up in knots. I just kind of go along minding my own damn business. Always have. And stress can tear you all to pieces.  JAMES LEUTZE: So when you make a decision you put aside, you don&#x27;t sort of go back and mull over it and say maybe, maybe, maybe.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, no, no, no.  JAMES LEUTZE: Are you a risk taker? If you make up your mind quickly there&#x27;s a certain amount of risk involved.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Life is full of risks. In the banking business you&#x27;ve got to know what you&#x27;re doing for one thing, and you make up your mind if you want to do it. Period.  JAMES LEUTZE: And do you make mistakes that way?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, sure.  JAMES LEUTZE: What do you do about your mistakes?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, you try to correct them. Eventually, I was a vice-president, and eventually president, and then chairman of the board, you see that on my curriculum vitae. And I&#x27;m still chairman; they elect me chairman of the board every year for a term of one year only. So I&#x27;ve got to be a good boy. But it&#x27;s gone on for, I reckon, thirty years.  JAMES LEUTZE: One more question on this issue of personal style. What about dealing with subordinates? Do you give a subordinate a lot of room to make decisions and to make mistakes?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Sure, sure, sure. Got to. I have always followed the general principle that I listen first what his thought might be. Then we discuss the situation and we decide. He may decide, I may decide. That&#x27;s that. Go on about his business.  JAMES LEUTZE: And so you give your subordinates plenty of room.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I listen. I&#x27;m considered one of the best listeners in Durham. And I don&#x27;t pat myself on the back about that, but I mean that&#x27;s just one way of doing things.  JAMES LEUTZE: One wonders, though, where does this sense of confidence come from? That you can make up your mind quickly and that you can put your mistakes behind you? Where does this sense of confidence come from?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, my grandfather was a confident man, for one thing, tall, slender, six-foot-two. And he used to walk me to school at the old Morehead Grammar School, down Jackson, middle of the street. He&#x27;d stroll right out and I&#x27;d keep up with him. And I&#x27;d lean over and he&#x27;d hit me in the back. &quot;Straighten up,&quot; I can remember, &quot;straighten up, you little devil, straighten up.&quot; He never cussed or anything like that. He smoked cigars. I learned something there. And I was very much disturbed when the family would send the carriage for me or send me to school on a rainy day with a carriage or send for me, I was set apart from other people. I didn&#x27;t like that, at all. Town carriage, it was brought back from New York. I don&#x27;t remember my father telling me what to do or what not to do. I just have no memory of that.  JAMES LEUTZE: So, maybe you absorbed in a sense a personal style.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I think so. He used to come home and talk to us at the table and tell us what had happened, and so forth. I&#x27;ll never forget one thing he told us. My two sistes were gaga when he said he knew a preacher was coming to see him and wanted a thousand dollars, which was big money in those days. To make a long story short, he met him at the door with five dollars cash and handed it to him, patted him on the back, and the preacher went away happy. That was big doings as far as we were just kids. I don&#x27;t know how old we were.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now as an example, although it violates chronology a little bit, I want to go back for a second to your college career. You said you built the SAE house. What do you mean by that?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I was in charge. I selected the architect, I followed the architect, I told him what to do. Atwood and Nash had—I forget now who built the damn thing. Got the contractor, followed the contractor, paid for it, did the financing. I remember it didn&#x27;t cost more than $25,000, something like that.  JAMES LEUTZE: But you took a lot of responsibility.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I was responsible. Period. I didn&#x27;t ask anybody. I just built it.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK. It&#x27;s incredible to think of a nineteen or twenty year old taking the responsibility for building a $25,000 building which, as they say, was real money at that point.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: In those days. Well. When I came home after ten months overseas honeymoon, thereby hangs a story.  JAMES LEUTZE: Yeah, I want to hear about that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: One of the first things my father did was say, &quot;I wish you&#x27;d build a store building,&quot; which is now occupied by Rolls, or was; God knows what&#x27;s there now on Main Street. So, I got an architect, contractor, and we built a three-story limestone front building. It was a hell of a nice building. He had organized Tilley&#x27;s store, put them in there and they went bust. And it took me eighteen months to clean the damn mess up and lease it to somebody else. That was one of the first jobs I ever had.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did your father lean over your shoulder on a project like that and say, &quot;Well, let me see the drawings and let me be sure that I like that,&quot; and so on, and so on, and so on. He let you do it.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: He had his office in the northwest corner of the Trust Building, which he had built when he came down from New York. It was the first real office building built in North Carolina, 1903-04. Then the secretary&#x27;s office, then I had an office. And my grandfather was across the hall.  JAMES LEUTZE: And you were accepted as a decision-making participant in the process, then?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I was told, I was asked, not told, I was asked to do so and so and I did it. Period.  JAMES LEUTZE: Alright, we&#x27;ll conclude this in a moment but tell me about this honeymoon that you went on.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My father was a very generous man. And he asked me, he said, &quot;I wish you would look at your grandfather&#x27;s,&quot; my grandfather had died, &quot;situation in South Korea. And I have business that I&#x27;d like you to attend to in Shanghai. Would you like to go to Korea and Shanghai on your honeymoon?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s pretty damn good.&quot; But we discussed it with my wife to be and we decided, fine. We got to Shanghai.  JAMES LEUTZE: How did you go? How did you travel?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: By boat.  JAMES LEUTZE: So you had to take the train across the country?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We went to New York, got married in Baltimore and went to New York; spent the night; caught one of the American Line boats that had a small number of passengers, a freight ship, that kept going around the world. Every few weeks another would go around. We went to Havana, spent two days in Havana. Went on through the Panama Canal. Came around to Los Angeles.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now was this a kind of luxury liner?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, no, no, no. It was a passenger-freighter in those days. Oh, there might be thirty passengers and upper and lower berth, simple. They stopped for two days in Havana for freight and so forth and went to Panama, to Los Angeles. I had flu in Los Angeles so we left the boat. Were there for two weeks.  JAMES LEUTZE: Los Angeles was a small town in those days, was it not?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, it was a good size.  JAMES LEUTZE: Really?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I remember we stayed the night at the Ambassador Hotel, and we stayed there two weeks. It damn near broke me. The Ambassador was the hotel in those days. Then we went on to San Francisco. We went to Santa Barbara by automobile, and went to San Francisco and we caught another one of those boats to Hawaii. We were in Hawaii three or four days, and so forth. I was recuperating. Went to Japan. We got to Japan shortly after the earthquake had destroyed Yokahama. And we landed at Yokahama and I remember my wife getting in a rickshaw. &quot;Gone in the darkness.&quot;  JAMES LEUTZE: You thought you&#x27;d lost her, right?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I thought so. But eventually she showed up.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was destruction from the earthquake still obvious?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah. The steps to the American Embassy, or consulate, or whatever it was—there were three steps, I remember vividly. Period. Cement something. A whole side of the hill had come in. Oh, it was something. It wasn&#x27;t far from Tokyo. We went on to Tokyo and the Imperial Hotel, which had been built by Frank Lloyd Wright—earthquake-proof.  JAMES LEUTZE: It sort of floated.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And spread all over the hill. And there we met a gal who was the first white girl born (thirty-three years before) in Japan. The wife of Trustcon Steel people, I can&#x27;t remember the name. I thought about it the other day. And she gave us use of of a car and chauffeur. We rode all over Tokyo and we went up to Kyoto and the shrines. We came back and we went over on the west coast of Japan and took a boat that went to Pusan; Pusan in those days, I think it was called, in Korea. Overnight and, oh, we were in Japan for ten days or more. And we caught the train to Seoul. And I remember it was like an American parlor car except it had a long seat on both sides. And a Japanese plenipotentiary came aboard at some stop with his man all dressed up in cut-away, and he took off every damn thing, stood there naked as a jaybird, and we were sitting across on the other bench. We looked at him and his man said nothing.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  JAMES LEUTZE: … Japan at that time, so you were something of an oddity, I assume.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I had on knickers, the kind that went over the knee. I remember walking along and seeing little Japanese boys kneeling down and looking up under my coat, and times we stopped so they could see what the hell I had on. Quite a feeling.  JAMES LEUTZE: You describe the scene on the railroad car [interruption]   JAMES LEUTZE: The scene of seeing this gentleman nude. So you went to Seoul.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Went to Seoul. A missionary met us in a car, a Ford, and he had a missionary woman with him. The two girls sat on the back seat. I sat on the front seat with this missionary and we drove down to Taiden and on down to Sungchun and Kwanchu on the west coast, became mountainous. And he was driving through the mountain country and talking to the back seat and just driving ahead and finally I took the damn wheel, got him out of the way, the preacher. We got to Sungchun or Kwanchu, I don&#x27;t remember which it was. My grandfather had established a medical missionary station there and had a one-armed doctor, he lost an arm shooting &quot;gwoog&quot; (pheasants), as they called them, and they had a little native hospital, a big Japanese hospital, a very big building, and no Korean would go to the Japanese hospital.  JAMES LEUTZE: How did he happen to establish a hospital in Korea? That was a very distant land.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, the church was interested in Korea.  JAMES LEUTZE: The Presbyterian church?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: This was the Presbyterian church, the First Presbyterian Church of Durham. And, I don&#x27;t know, somebody talked him into building a little hospital, a medical clinic, and they preached and took care of the patients, all together. And the preachers came from over here in Richmond, Union Theological Seminary, southerners. I remember Anne and I coming back to the church eventually in Durham and talking to the congregation at night service, Sunday night, in which we lambasted the preachers, both of us. And we said they weren&#x27;t worth a damn. But they&#x27;d preach the gospel, yes, but it was not what you and I would like. But the medical side of it was marvelous and they were doing a great job of developing Christians.  JAMES LEUTZE: And serving the medical needs of the area.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And this preacher had seven children. And I remember a great big bed and the baseboard was far away from the floor, and you could lay there and see the old Koreans going by in their white long gown aand black horsehair hat. And I heard a knock on the door and the amah, the maid, said we&#x27;d better get up and I looked out the other way and I saw the four-holer with seven kids lined up waiting to get into the four-holer. And I said, &quot;Yeah, I thought we better get up.&quot;  JAMES LEUTZE: The bathroom was in heavy demand at that point.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And we stayed there two or three days and then caught the boat and went to Shanghai and stayed in the Astor Hotel, the only hotel in Shanghai in those days, 1925.  JAMES LEUTZE: Along the &quot;bund&quot; as it was called?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Along the bund. And I remember when we first started upstairs there was a China boy laying across the threshold. By that time I had picked up enough Pidgeon English, so I said, &quot;What you do, boy?&quot; He said, &quot;Me key boy.&quot; I can remember it vividly. He reached up on the top of the lintel, got the key, opened the door, and laid down beside the door. And that was it.  JAMES LEUTZE: That was his job, was to open the door and watch the key.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And then a knock came on the door, that&#x27;s while we were unpacking, and I said, &quot;What you do?&quot; &quot;Me give miss bath.&quot; I said, &quot;No, sorry.&quot; But he drew the tub and she took a bath. The water, when you pulled the plug in the tub, the water ran down the side of the room through a little channel and out on the sidewalk. The &quot;john&quot; worked.  JAMES LEUTZE: Shanghai interests me as an international community; were you aware of that?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We were sent by this girl, the first white girl born in Japan, to her sister, who was Mrs. Atkinson, the wife of the &quot;number one&quot; man in Shanghai, Standard Oil. Call him the mayor, or whatnot, he was &quot;it.&quot; She sent us to her sister [interruption]   JAMES LEUTZE: We were talking about the international community in …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The Bund was filled with sampans. And they lived on the sampans, some of them never got off the sampan.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was the British presence very obvious there?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yes, no question. And there was no problem. We went out to Crow&#x27;s antique shop. The day after we were there the irregular troops came in and tore it all to hell. We could not go to Peking, as we wanted to, on the Blue train, because the irregulars stopped the train every so often and killed everybody, and what the hell.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was the revolution very apparent in China at that time? I mean the disruptions…  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, not particularly, but when we went aboard the ship to sail to Hong Kong, we went in a hail of bullets.  JAMES LEUTZE: You&#x27;re kidding?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I&#x27;m not kidding you.  JAMES LEUTZE: The irregulars were shooting?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah. Oh, hell, nobody paid too much attention to it one way or the other. We didn&#x27;t bother.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you have the sense of a society coming apart? Of the dynasty not able to maintain? Things went smoothly at that time.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The rickshaws, no automobiles. You went by rickshaw.  JAMES LEUTZE: But you felt relatively safe, secure, as a foreigner.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I never thought about it, as I remember thinking back on it.  JAMES LEUTZE: We had an Asiatic fleet there, there was a ship that sometimes came to Shanghai. Did you ever see any American military presence in either Japan or China?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I eventually knew at Virginia Beach a retired naval officer who was the ensign, the only naval officer, American, in the Far East, when he was an ensign on the Yangtzee River.  JAMES LEUTZE: There were patrol boats, they had, river patrol boats. An author from here in Chapel Hill wrote a book called The Sand Pebbles, in fact, about the Yangtzee patrol boats and what they did in the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s and what life was like.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The name of Julian Timberlake.  JAMES LEUTZE: Then from Shanghai, where did you go?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We went to Hong Kong and it was quite a city, very, very British, controlled by the British. I don&#x27;t remember the hotel or anything but it was nothing to compare to what you see now from photographs. And we went to Canton on the riverboat and came back. And then we went from Hong Kong to Bangkok by boat and we spent a week in Bangkok. We spent a week any damn place we wanted.  JAMES LEUTZE: You had a photograph in there of Pnom Phen.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: That was—I have to stop and think a minute—French Indochina. We went from Bangkok to French Indochina, as I remember, or may be beforehand. Now Vietnam, we went to Pnom Phen first. And, oh, yeah. We went down south, we caught a little bitty boat, a little bitty thing. And I used to go swimming off the boat with a very big fat Chinese captain. We got into Bangkok eventually. And we went on from Bangkok to Calcutta, up to Darjeeling, and that&#x27;s where we met the Irish golf champion, woman, a long story there. And we went on to Ceylon, that&#x27;s where we met her, in Ceylon. And then we caught the boat from Colombo, Ceylon, to Port Said or Suez, I don&#x27;t know which it was now. We had a mutiny on board.  JAMES LEUTZE: Oh, really?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah. American officers, the same boat.  JAMES LEUTZE: Line, the American Line.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I sat in the dining room with an American officer with a drawn pistol for three days.  JAMES LEUTZE: What did your wife do? Did she stay in her cabin or what?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, no, we just … You meet certain things and you handle them and you just go on about your business. The Chinese crew had been attacked by the Filipino stewards, or vice versa. They had been playing Fantan on the stern of the ship and a Filipino blew them up or messed them up. The China steward, a great big fellow (the same one who we&#x27;d had across the Pacific, the same boat), he said, &quot;Missy, lock door tonight.&quot; We&#x27;d just had a curtain to get the breeze, never air conditioning in those days. We were in Cairo, Luxor, Kharnak. Eventually we ended up in Rome, and that&#x27;s where mother sent us a cable that she was sailing on the Aquitania, such and such a date, meet her in London, period. We met her in London. I had cabled my father from Cairo to send me three thousand dollars. Well, he did, but he took it out of my savings account. I had $3.61, I found, when I got home. [laughter] That was typical of Dad.   JAMES LEUTZE: Now, how long did this whole trip take?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Ten months.  JAMES LEUTZE: Ten months.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And we met mother. We were going to spend the summer in Europe. We were there. And we met her in London and we came back with my two sisters on the Aquitania.  JAMES LEUTZE: From London.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: From London. Southampton. That was in June or July.  JAMES LEUTZE: What a trip!  GEORGE WATTS HILL: It was a gorgeous trip, to tell you the truth. But we had enough money saved from the return trip, Shanghai back to New York, to go the other way. We stretched it out, except for that three thousand dollars.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what would you say was the long term influence on your life of that trip? Did it influence and your view of the world?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, one, the memories. Two, we had a hell of a good time. We had twenty-eight pieces of baggage including two golf bags, and I never touched them from the time we got on the boat in New York til I got back. [laughter] In those days there were porters; you handle your own damn  baggage now.  JAMES LEUTZE: You can&#x27;t find a porter now. Now, I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of what it was like. Did you dress for dinner at this time?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. We dressed in Darjeeling. I took a dinner coat, of course, and Darjeeling was the only place that had a British custom. This was a rest camp up in the mountains, Darjeeling. Some, no we didn&#x27;t dress in Colombo. Well, it was a fascinating trip and the memories, I haven&#x27;t thought about the trip for a long time, but a lot of things come back and there&#x27;ll be more once I start thinking about it, I reckon. But it gave you a sense, an understanding of a whole lot of things that happened and I read a lot, magazines, articles, Newsweek, and Time, and Fortune, and so on. But you&#x27;ve been there and it&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s completely changed. And it hasn&#x27;t changed.  JAMES LEUTZE: I&#x27;m jumping ahead in a sense in thinking about your involvement in international affairs at the time of the Second World War and wondering whether this trip gave a sense of the world that was somewhat different from that of your colleagues that were  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, I think so, without any question. I was a member of the &quot;Committee to Defend America through Aid to the Allies&quot; prior to the war, the Second World War. And I worked like a dog for that and I had the southern aspect of it. And I remember Hodding Carter. My job was to persuade people, newspapers, writers, and stuff, to change from isolationist to interventionist. And I went on then, it eventually turned into something requiring that I go to New York every so often. Oh, that damn train was just back and forth, before the days of planes. And to New York, I can&#x27;t think of that man&#x27;s name who&#x27;s the head of the thing; we used to meet at the old University Club, a group of us. Herbert Agar. We threw Bob Allen out because he talked. We had confidential intelligence, British and Fench intelligence, and I think we did a job.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, I want to go into that on a next visit.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  JAMES LEUTZE: We left off last time, I think we were up to the mid-1920s and talking about your marriage and your honeymoon and your coming back and more or less getting started in business.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: In 1926.  JAMES LEUTZE: &#x27;26.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: &#x27;25, the fall of &#x27;25.  JAMES LEUTZE: What was Durham like in 1925?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: A little town. That&#x27;s about all.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was it a center of commerce?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, no, no. It was, I don&#x27;t quite know how to describe it. American and Liggett &amp; Myers tobacco companies, real manufacturing, then Imperial Tobacco, had a receiving station where… The tobacco market was a real thing in Durham in those days, four or five big warehouses and the farmers brought their tobacco in and the tobacco companies bought it. Imperial bought a lot of tobacco and shipped it to England, it being one of the companies that Mr. Buck Duke had organized back in the early days of the first few years of the century. And when he had gone to England and took over several British concerns and organized the Imperial Tobacco Company to handle England, and American Tobacco to handle North America, and the British—American Tobacco Company to handle the rest of the world. He thought big. [laughter] And there were quite a number of smaller handlers of tobacco at  that time. The Erwin Mill was in full force, and one of the great sheeting mills, the largest sheeting mill in the world, is still in Durham and is operating. It has just been sold, I believe, by Burlington to Stevens recently. Durham Manufacturing Company was another one in east Durham; that was handled by Mr. Harper Erwin. Bill Erwin was the president of Erwin Mills. My grandfather was vice-president &#x27;til his death and then my father became vice-president. I went on the board to serve for thirty years, or something, on the board of directors. But tobacco companies, tobacco manufacturing and textiles were the business of Durham.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was it a company town, in a sense?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yes, the Erwin Mill owned a great many houses, small houses, three or four rooms, all in a row, all out in west Durham. And the same thing applied to the Durham Cotton Manufacturing Company, that&#x27;s the proper name, had similar houses in east Durham. And East Durham was filled with textile workers; West Durham was textile and the tobacco workers were scattered all over in Durham. Durham was 50,000 people or something like that at the time, whereas now it&#x27;s 125,000.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now what about the black community in Durham?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The black community was strong. It&#x27;s always been strong as far as I can remember in that now they&#x27;re 45 percent or something like that of the population of Durham. But then it was far less. They have a much higher birth rate than the whites and all kinds of problems.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was there a black elite? A black business and intellectual elite?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: There was a black bank that was started by the doctors, Dr. Spalding came into the picture. Spalding started the insurance company, the North Carolina Mutual, which became the largest Negro life insurance company in the world and still here. Some of his descendants and relatives and so on are still running it, Kennedy and so on. But it was a shirt-tail of a business to start with. And I remember my grandfather and father assisted Dr. Merrick and one other man to start the company; they put up some money and showed them how to do it and so forth, and then they went on their own. Grandfather and Dad have never had any part in the operation at all and eventually the North Carolina Mutual became one of the outstanding businesses in Durham as represented by a building that&#x27;s fifteen or twenty stories high on the old Ben Duke home place. They bought that block and built it. There&#x27;s a long story about that building but that&#x27;s that.  JAMES LEUTZE: Were there any of the Duke family members still in Durham at that time?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Buck Duke was, and Ben Duke was, in the old Fidelity Bank. And when my father first came here, and I may have said so before, that they did not pay interest on savings accounts and my father had a real fight with them because he started what&#x27;s now the Central Carolina Bank, it was then Durham Loan and Trust Company and Durham Realty and Insurance Company in the old Trust Building. And he paid 4 percent interest on savings accounts regardless of whether people came in and demanded it or asked for it and so forth. And Mr. Buck Duke, Buck and Ben were in the Fidelity Bank, controlled it at least, and they were vice-president and president. And, as my father said, they almost ran him out on a rail out of town because he paid interest. He thought that was fair and that was proper and that was his way of doing business and eventually Fidelity Bank, which was the Duke bank and the bank in Durham at the time, eventually they started paying interest. You had to go in and demand it before they&#x27;d pay it. And it&#x27;s interesting that in 1937, I think it was, when we built the office building, I built, which is now the CCB Building, that we had reached roughly ten million dollars of total assets. That was a lot of money in those days. And the Fidelity Bank was the same and we were passing, we were slowly creeping up on the Fidelity Bank and so they joined, or merged, into the Wachovia. Mr. John Wiley was the president and Mr. Kirkland later took his place when Wiley died. They all lived over on the Morehead Hill section, the Wileys, the Whites, the Moreheads, the Watts, the Hills, and so forth; that was the section of town. My father, when he came to town or shortly thereafter, organized the first real estate residential development in Durham, which is now known as Club Boulevard, from the water works east to Watts Hospital, and now the Science and Math complex.  JAMES LEUTZE: I used to live on 2133 West Club Boulevard, the house that Walter Biggs built. So I know that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, yeah. Walter became a member of the city council and then he had an unfortunate situation.  JAMES LEUTZE: His son got in… Well, anyhow …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: That&#x27;s another story.  JAMES LEUTZE: We&#x27;ll have to take that off the tape. I&#x27;ll tell you, I heard a funny story, I think it was Ben Duke that it was attributed to, that somebody, that Duke was going with a woman of loose morals and some member of the family got him aside and said, &quot;You can&#x27;t do this, it&#x27;s hurting the reputation of the family. That woman has slept with every man in Durham.&quot; And he thought for a moment and he said, &quot;Well, Durham&#x27;s not such a big town.&quot; [laughter]   GEORGE WATTS HILL: I never heard that one.  JAMES LEUTZE: I&#x27;m not sure. I think it may be apocryphal.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I think so because Ben Duke was—he looked like Disraeli, almost, was little and, not shriveled up or anything like that but he was very delicate looking, whereas Buck Duke was [with exaggeration] great, big, full, great, big stomach, tough.  JAMES LEUTZE: Country boy; well, I mean, they were country people for a long time.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, sure, they were country people. Old Wash Duke lived out in what is now the Duke Homestead on the northern portion of Durham. They had the tobacco barns. And he started in about, as I said last time, building the hogsheads and so on, had a belly on them so that they could roll them to Wilmington to ship the tobacco to England. But the troops that were stationed here just west of Durham two or three miles out at the end of the Civil War, broke into the tobacco barns and stole the tobacco. That&#x27;s how the tobacco business got started. They scattered all over the United States, then they wrote back for some of that &quot;good Durham tobacco,&quot; basically chewing tobacco, in those days. And Washington Duke and his two sons were smart enough to take advantage of the opportunity that they started and so forth and out of that grew the tobacco industry—American Tobacco Trust, Liggett, Philip—Morris, and what have you, Lorillard, and so forth. But Durham was a small community except for the tobacco and textiles and eventually Mr. Wright came into the picture. He had something to do with the American Tobacco Company and he also was helpful in developing the Bon Sac cigarette machine to make cigarettes by machinery whereas they had been rolled by hand. They brought a bunch of Spaniards over here to roll them by hand. They didn&#x27;t have any cigar manufacture because that was a different type of tobacco; that was Kentucky. And they called the tobacco &quot;Virginia&quot; tobacco for some reason, God only knows. But it was basically North Carolina tobacco all the way through, brightleaf.  JAMES LEUTZE: Sounds like a Virginia plot.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, it was very typical of Virginia. They&#x27;d take the full credit for everything. North Carolina in those days was known as &quot;a vale of humility between two mountains of conceit, &quot;— Virginia and South Carolina. Of course, South Carolina had been settled a long time ago and Virginia had the Cavaliers. And North Carolina was settled by the third and fourth sons that didn&#x27;t have a cent. They&#x27;d come over from England and the Moravians and various and sundry different groups of people, the Germans.  JAMES LEUTZE: The Valdesians.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And so forth. So we had a working group fo people in North Carolina in the early days and they did a good job.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, was Durham considered to be a center of commerce for all of North Carolina at that time?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, I wouldn&#x27;t say a center of manufacturing of those two, tobacco and textiles, but old Raleigh looked down on Durham. Raleigh was the center—the state capital and so forth—and Hillsborough had been the capital back in late Revolutionary days, and they looked down their nose. Everybody looked down their nose at Durham. They didn&#x27;t do that in Winston-Salem, for some reason. Greensboro was a little town. Winston-Salem was in the tobacco business; Reynolds was just blooming like a rose. But old Durham was the fourth or fifth town; it was a town, it wasn&#x27;t a city. Raleigh was leading, Charlotte, Asheville, now Durham was what number five or six in the state. No. I can remember walking to school, public school, that was back in 19—well, I graduated in 1917, and so that was, I skipped two classes, so that was 1907 or something—we used to walk to grammar school and then went on to high school which is now the Durham Art Council building. But you never thought about it one way or the other. The big houses were on Morehead and the little houses were east Durham and west Durham and the middle houses were on Dillard Street. Now Dillard was where General Carr had a big, almost a, well I&#x27;d call it a gingerbread house, a tremendous damn thing on the corner of Main and Dillard and eventually Mr. Toms&#x27;s home, where the bus station is now in Durham. Main Street was—my uncle, Isham Hill had a reasonably small house on Main Street. Claiborne Carr, a son of the general, was on Main Street. Then Austin Carr, his younger brother, was in Durham opposite my father&#x27;s home, which was built in 1913. Claiborne was head of the Durham Hosiery Mill, was quite a hosiery mill down in east Durham, basically, and they built the silk mill in Durham behind what was then the First National Bank, that busted later during the Depression. The silk mill was a tremendous five or six story reinforced concrete building. That was a famous building. They manufactured the only silk stockings during the Second World War. I talked to them, from Washington in the OSS, and I got the complete production of silk stockings and would hand them out, or would have them given out, in Lisbon to various sources of intelligence. aAter I got the intelligence or my people did, we&#x27;d give them the second stocking, so that they had a pair of stockings.  JAMES LEUTZE: You give them one at a time.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: One at a time. Unless they produced they didn&#x27;t get it because Lisbon, Portugal, was a hotbed of intrigue of all nations—German, French, what have you.  JAMES LEUTZE: Because Portugal was neutral?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Neutral. Spain was neutral.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, going back to this 1925, mid—1925 period, as a young man entering business, going into business with your father and thinking of things on your own, did the world look bright to you? Did it look like this prosperity was going to go on forever?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I never thought about it one way or the other. I was busy. I lived on the corner of Morehead and Willard Street in a little house before Mrs. Morrison gave up her life interest in the big house. And after that happened I had to move up there. That was during the period of kidnapping and so forth that was going on all over the country.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now Watts must have been born …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Watts was born in 1927 or &#x27;8, something like that. And I had bars on the windows and so forth. We were set apart because we had a governess to take care of the kids. I was working, hell I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to them one way or the other. My first wife did. We had three children; every three years we had another kid. I remember the first automobile that ever came to Durham. I tried to drive it on what&#x27;s now Chapel Hill Street at Duke. It cranked on the side and you had little red roadster business and so on. I drove the first automobile we ever owned, a Buick; I met my father at the station because he went to New York by train. And the train came into the Union Station and we had five railroads serving Durham at the time. I think one or two are here now. I was fourteen as I remember and drove him home. There were very few automobiles in the community. We still had a horse and a buggy and a carriage and a victoria. The victoria burned up when the stable burned up one day. I used to go with my grandfather on Sunday morning, or Sunday afternoon, down to the Pearl Mill, as they called it, which was at Duke and Trinity avenue, as I remember. He taught Sunday school there and I used to drive him in the buggy and go in and listen. We&#x27;d tie the horse up. Well, that was the transportation. You never thought about it otherwise. Durham had a few paved streets, and Main Street was brick.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was there a trolley line?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, hell, yes, a trolley route. You could ride the trolley from east Durham out to Lakewood Park, which was a recreational park in the southern part of Durham. Now it&#x27;s a shopping center.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you have any impressions at that time of national politicians and the policies of people like Coolidge and Hoover and whether they were doing a good job or not?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yes. Well, I have to think back. Coolidge was a Yankee and, I guess, very quiet; Hoover was a big fellow in many respects and just full of, in my opinion, full of bull.  JAMES LEUTZE: He had been a businessman, or a mining engineer.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: He had been in Europe and so forth and on all kinds of rescue work and so forth. He was president when the bank holiday came to North Carolina and, as I said before, he asked my father if he couldn&#x27;t slow it down.  JAMES LEUTZE: Oh, I didn&#x27;t know, you didn&#x27;t tell me that. Now let&#x27;s. The crash comes in the fall of 1929 and then intensifies in &#x27;30 and &#x27;31.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: &#x27;31. We had our bank holiday in North Carolina because it was coming up from Florida and in South Carolina and Hoover called my father and asked him if he could slow it down or stop it, which we were able to do. As I remember, no bank in Virginia …  JAMES LEUTZE: That was to slow down the runs on the bank. There were people taking their money out.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, just busting because of that. And we had a little bank, it was a million and a half, as I remember, I was a vice-president at the time. My uncle Isham was running the savings and loan and his son was working in the bank, in the cage. Dad was president, and as I told you about the money going—it&#x27;s in an article here—feeding it out the back window and people flatten their noses on the window of the corridor and then coming in and making their deposit. We saved the Negro bank, Mechanics and Farmers, we saved the Citizens&#x27; Bank.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, by saving them you made loans to them?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, we put up some cash and made a loan. The Merchants&#x27; Bank, Mr. Clements, busted, had closed its doors. The First National Bank, as I remember, the First National Bank busted. That was the Carr bank. General Julian Carr was the president, and Claiborne Carr, a director, in what&#x27;s now the North Carolina National Bank building on the southeast corner of Main and Corcoran street.  JAMES LEUTZE: Why did your bank survive when these other banks …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, as I said before, I went to Charlotte and brought back some money, $500,000, and to Richmond and brought back some more money, $750,000—cash that my father put up in the Federal Reserve Bank, bonds and what have you, to get the cash, and Dad kept buying notes, taking notes out of the First National Bank, buying them. Just couldn&#x27;t take them out fast enough. The bank had over loaned, and so forth, and the Merchants&#x27; Bank the same way. They were just unable, when business stopped, to meet the demands of the public when they withdrew their money. And cash just wasn&#x27;t there. Well, we took out seven or eight hundred thousand dollars cash, notes, out of the First National Bank and I don&#x27;t remember doing anything for the Merchants&#x27; Bank. But the Citizens&#x27; Bank was the same way. That was the time that Trust Company bank expanded.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what was the bank called at this point?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The Durham Loan and Trust Company. Eventually it was changed to Durham Bank and Trust. And when we, as I said, when we merged the University National Bank in Chapel Hill into the Trust Company, as we called it, spoke of it, we changed the name to Central Carolina Bank because Durham, as one of these articles says, Chapel Hill just wouldn&#x27;t use the word Durham, period. They wouldn&#x27;t agree to it. So we used Central Carolina, which was by then the area in which we were in business.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, on this issue of banking and, obviously, your father must have had the confidence of a lot of people and have given the perception of stability, is that correct? How important would those …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: He was one of the strong characters of the community, one of the leading characters, people—not a character, exactly. He was the son-in-law of George W. Watts, who had been in the tobacco business and retired. Dad was wealthy compared to the majority of people in Durham, and he owned the farms known as Hillandale and Croisdale Farm, fifteen, eighteen hundred acres northwest of Durham. It belongs to my sister Frances Fox now, where the development Croisdale is taking place, golfcourse and so on. Dad operated that as a dairy farm, my farm, Quail Roost, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll see some of the &quot;three titters and one eyed cows,&quot; pure-breds, that had come from my great-grandfather&#x27;s farm in Baltimore, where he had a fine dairy herd. That&#x27;s when I started my farm, my dairy herd. No, people respected my father and he was a strong leader in the church as my grandfather had been before him. I just never thought about it one way or the other.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did he put any of his own money into the bank? In other words, did he take money out of capital to help keep the bank afloat or was it simply by getting loans from the Federal Reserve?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: He took his own personal money, Mother and Dad&#x27;s. They called me in, my wife and I, one night at home. They lived in the concrete stucco red-roofed house he gave to the city in memory of his wife. I remember being called over there by my father and him saying that he had put up everything that mother had and he had, made it available in the crisis, and what did I think? And I said that anything I have is yours. And I turned to my wife and she said yes; she didn&#x27;t have anything particularly but I did. I had received some trusts from my grandfather Watts back when I was 25 and they had multiplied. I had some, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot. But it was that approach to life that whatever you had to do, you did, period.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  JAMES LEUTZE: No, no.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Jumping back and forth.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, I think we sometimes have to follow a line of thought or a line of discussion without being too bound by the chronology. So, you were saying that your father just decided that the thing to do was to make personal investments in the bank to make sure …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: He started the Durham Morris Plan Bank, and he went on, as I said before, to Home Security Life Insurance Company, now known as Peoples Security after merging it into Home Security.  JAMES LEUTZE: Let&#x27;s pick on that. What date would that be?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: 1916 or &#x27;17. Two men had started it, two brothers had put fifty thousand dollars in and it was busted almost. Within six or twelve months Dad was asked to come in with them, which he did, and, as in everything else, he had controlling stock. Just enough. As he had in the bank, he was the controlling stockholder, had more than fifty percent of the stock in the bank, and the same thing with the insurance company. And he was very active in the insurance company and he put me on the board.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what sort of things did you do? What was your role?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I didn&#x27;t do anything except agree with the management, for awhile, and eventually I became vice-president, then president, and eventually chairman of the board. Then I got out shortly before they combined with Capital Holding. My son had become chairman and president. He worked in the bank four or five years, he didn&#x27;t like the banking business and got out and went to the insurance company full-time. And my cousin, Arthur Clark, came into the insurance company and he&#x27;s the current president and chairman, a very fine, reserve major general in the air force and so on; he had quite a tour in China during the war.  JAMES LEUTZE: Didn&#x27;t he go to Taiwan as an adviser?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, he was in Burma. &quot;Over the hump&quot; two or three times, and so on, tall, grey-haired fellow. Took him to a basketball game Saturday.  JAMES LEUTZE: But now, back to the Depression, back to the 1930s.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And the insurance company was a little thing and it just slowly grew.  JAMES LEUTZE: In the Depression, were you depressed about the Depression? Were you concerned about the stability of the economy and whether the country was going to recover?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Not particularly. Too busy. Scratching at local things, at that time. We had no national approach, as I remember, one way or the other. My father was in the legislature; I don&#x27;t remember when. He served two terms in the senate. He had been on the city council when he first came back from New York. He&#x27;d been quite a politician in New York and he was a liberal, not as we consider liberal today, but very liberal for those days. Not like Proxmire or whatever you want to call them. I served on the city council for eight years as a youngster. That was &#x27;27.  JAMES LEUTZE: Yeah, the late &#x27;20s, I know.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The late &#x27;20s. I remember the city owed, I found out, $900,000—invasion of the bond fund. And I got off the city council when we had paid it back and had $250,000 cash in the bank. I became chairman of the finance committee and we had the first city manager in North Carolina, as I remember. Rigsbee was the city manager when I was there, and then Bob Flack took his place. Rigsbee went on to something else. We became great friends. I was a real youngster, because the rest of the council were old men.  JAMES LEUTZE: You were 26, 27, 30 years old.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Different people, Coy Smith, Carpenter, Lyon. But I worked at that. Didn&#x27;t get any pay for it.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what about your attitude toward, say, Franklin Roosevelt when he comes in in &#x27;32.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, everybody was gung ho. The first thing he did was to declare a national bank holiday. He had been governor of New York state and had done a great many things and he came in at a time when he was a white haired man, &quot;a white haired father,&quot; no question about that. Jonathan Daniels, a great friend of mine, Josephus Daniels&#x27;s son, we&#x27;d been in college together, he was smarter than I, he graduated in three years, he was one of the president&#x27;s assistants (he had five or six). And that was &#x27;33. And then he went on for two and a half terms, as I remember. I could get about any information I wanted through Jonathan.  JAMES LEUTZE: He was in the press office, I think, he was sort of the press officer. So you had a positive impression that he was doing good things for the country.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, no question about it. Roosevelt petered out when it came to the end of the war. He was a sick man, and Stalin and Churchill took advantage of him, no question about that.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, in 1933 …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: It&#x27;s a bank holiday.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, it&#x27;s a bank holiday, but that&#x27;s the same year that North Carolina Blue Cross/Blue Shield began? Tell me a little bit about that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: &#x27;33 was a big year in my life.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK, tell me about that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I organized, at my father&#x27;s request, the Central Carolina Farmers, which eventually was combined with FCX and was recently sold to Southern States. We operated, my father had an old mill down in east Durham. It had been Pearl Mill, that was the name of it, and we made that available. I brought a man, Tilson, from Sparta in western North Carolina, the county agent, and we organized this farmer&#x27;s exchange to serve farm people where they could bring their produce—corn, grain, what have you—into the old mill. We would buy and give them cash for it and we in turn would manufacture and sell it to other people. But it made a market for farm produce, a market that was not available anywhere else. We had an outlet in Roxboro, one in Chapel Hill. It&#x27;s still there, back behind Carr Mill in Chapel Hill. That mill was another one of the Carr&#x27;s that busted eventually; they closed it). We were not in Wake County, we were in Orange County, Chatham County, Person County, Durham, five counties. It slowly developed into a tremendous operation headquartered in Durham and eventually it was combined. But Tilson and I worked at that and, again, I didn&#x27;t get any pay for it, but it was a lot of fun and the bank financed the exchange.  JAMES LEUTZE: Why did you do it?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, Dad had asked me to and it was rendering a service. I don&#x27;t know.  JAMES LEUTZE: A farmer&#x27;s cooperative is in the old populist tradition, I mean, political …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, it came through. My father had learned in 1913 when he came back eventually as chairman of the American commission to study rural credits—Germany, Italy, and England. That&#x27;s when he got interested in farm credits. And after women and liquor shot down five chairman, he came back as chairman and organized the first one, Rural Credit Association, now Credit Union at Lowes Grove, North Carolina, which is right down the road. And out of that grew the federal farm finance, basically, for farmers and for little people that couldn&#x27;t and get the needed funds from a bank. Eventually, 1933, we organized Central Farmers Exchange and it developed into a tremendous business with big silos and mills and chicken business. It was a tremendous thing—five counties.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now you say a service, did your father have, and did you inherit from him, a sense of obligation and service in a way to the public?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: It was not obligation. I never thought of it that way, one way or the other. But you had a job to do and you just did it. There&#x27;s no way I could be pressed.  JAMES LEUTZE: I think you&#x27;re being self-effacing, in a sense.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, it&#x27;s just that I never thought about it and my father was tremendously interested. He was running the farm, he was interested in the farmer. He was always interested in, he called it, the little people, the little folks. And the bank was organized. We didn&#x27;t have big people on the board. They were middle-sized people, because the big people owned the Fidelity or the Citizens and they were already there, the so-called &quot;big people.&quot; And when he took over the Home Savings Bank he found that the big people, who were the directors, had busted the bank. It was busted through too many loans, no collateral. He went to work and straightened that one out. He made them pay. They couldn&#x27;t understand that, the Carrs and others. [laughter]   JAMES LEUTZE: Alright. Now, in &#x27;33 there also was the North Carolina Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: There was the Blue Cross. Dr. Davison, then of Duke University, he came down here as the chief resident from Hopkins—had been in England and he had had some relationships, some knowledge, of hospital insurance; not what we&#x27;d organized here but something on the way toward that. And it was a Depression time and I was running Watts Hospital at the time.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now you say running, you mean as an administrator?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, I was president of the board, unofficial president, you might say, and my auditor in the office was Bo Harris, whom I&#x27;d brought over from the city. We were on the same floor as my father; both offices were in the Trust Building later and in the CCB Building. I had a Director of the hospital. And the three of us ran the damn place. There wasn&#x27;t any question about it. I had built an addition, the Private Patient Pavilion, in honor of my grandmother, through funds my grandfather had left. I got the hospital up to ninety-one patients capacity, and eventually to 301. But we were having a tremendous loss, we thought at that time; looking at it now, hell, it was just chicken feed. But it was vital to keep the hospital going. We didn&#x27;t have much coming from the city or the county in those days—$1,000 apiece or something like that. And the charity patients, part-charity patients, were a tremendous percentage. Same thing at Duke; Duke had started in &#x27;24 and they built Duke South, we call it now. Davison was up against the same thing. And we started Blue Cross. And I gave them an office in the old Trust Building and we brought Lash Herndon in as manager and I don&#x27;t know why—he was an insurance agent, or something, to start with. And we slowly grew and at one time we had Duke put up $50,000 as a loan and I put up $50,000 personally. We never used it; we had it. It was $100,000, big money in those days. And Blue Cross slowly grew and moved over to where Guaranty State is now, on the second floor, and then, eventually, when we built the Insurance Company Building on Chapel Hill and Duke street, Blue Cross had a floor up there. They paid a little rent but not much. In &#x27;30, Dr Manning, Isaac Manning here in Chapel Hill, we helped him get $25,000 somehow, somewhere. I&#x27;ve forgotten how. He went to Charlotte and organized (with Graham-Davis) the Hospital Savings Association about a year and a half after we had started Hospital Care. Duke and Watts Hospital controlled Hospital Care. We had the Duke vice-president for finance on the board, and my then-bank president was the president. All non-profit. And naturally I had the bank account—naturally. [laughter] But, that&#x27;s all I got out of it.   JAMES LEUTZE: Now, this was all non-profit.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: All non-profit. And we eventually—it was then Blue Cross—I helped them buy forty or fifty acres where the Blue Cross is now. And I got Alec McMahon eventually (Alex was then the secretary of the County Commissioners Association, headquartered in Raleigh) I got him in as president of the Hospital Savings, our opposition. We were fighting each other. We had a smaller number of members than Hospital Savings, but we had more cash and greater investments and so forth, than Hospital Savings. Eventually we went to Greensboro and I preached a sermon and &quot;got the Lord on my side,&quot; as the old expression goes. We combined the two and John Harris, became the president, and Joe Eagles of Wilson, then business manager in the university, was vice president of savings. We combined the two into &quot;Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina.&quot; Savings had been able to obtain the Blue Cross, which was hospitalization, and Blue Shield was medical. They had obtained approval of the use of Blue Cross hospitals and they had kept Hospital Care from getting Blue Cross. And we, the three of us (a hospital man, a doctor, and I was the public representative) went to Colorado Springs. Again we &quot;got the Lord on my side.&quot; We got there before Hospital Savings and we sold a bill of goods to the National Blue Cross Association and got approval. And I know Manning was so mad. So was Crawford, who was their vice-president of savings. They were terribly upset. But once we got that Blue Cross, we both had Blue Cross/Blue Shield and we could combine them and it became proper to combine them, at one time, though just exactly when I don&#x27;t remember, I don&#x27;t remember a date, but I can remember putting it together. Then we built the new building and brought Tom Rose to Chapel Hill when Alec McMahon went on to be President of American Hospital Association.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, I&#x27;ll ask the same question I asked about CCF, why did you do this?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: For Watts Hospital and Duke Hospital. We organized it. They needed the money and by prepayment of insurance they could through its members receiving the funds, could also pay, part pay, and reduce the amount of charity.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you see also that this was a public service that you were doing?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I never thought about it, but it was an effort that would get proper payment—cash available—into the two hospitals at the time. And Lincoln Hospital was the black hospital at the time and, I can&#x27;t say black, I call it colored, and they had their problems and it helped them to a more limited degree. But, we learned a lot from Duke Hospital as Watts Hospital is in a continual fight with Duke Hospital but a very quiet, undercover fight because they were stealing our patients. [laughter] Sure.   JAMES LEUTZE: Now let me ask you, I think I almost can anticipate your answer to this question, but mid-1930s your children were born, you were involved in business, you had built a couple of new enterprises, what were your ambitions at that time? What did you want? Did you ever think about what you wanted to accomplish when you got to be an older man?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. Quite honestly, no, I just kind of went along, you might say. As I said earlier, my father never gave me any particular direction one way or the other. And I got into the swing of things and one thing leads to another and there you go.  JAMES LEUTZE: So you would not describe yourself as an introspective person?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, no, no, no. It was right on the surface, just always rolling.  JAMES LEUTZE: And to follow through on the point, you were not measuring yourself against some goal. You didn&#x27;t set yourself a goal as a young man. I know some young people that say, &quot;Well, I want to make a million dollars,&quot; or &quot;I want to earn more than my father earned,&quot; or &quot;When I get to be fifty…&quot;  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. I didn&#x27;t give a damn. I had enough. I had property, stocks and bonds, from 25 on, I was busted to hell before that. Mother and dad didn&#x27;t give me anything. I had to work for it. And I had to get a salary, and got married on the salary of $250 a month. I don&#x27;t know who paid it, whether the bank paid it or dad paid it or whatnot. I never thought about it. But I don&#x27;t know, it now just sounds crazy. But one thing led to another and you saw a need and you handled it and you went ahead.  JAMES LEUTZE: OK. Did you worry about what people thought about you?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. Didn&#x27;t give a damn. [laughter]   JAMES LEUTZE: I believe that.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Because I could take care of myself, financially.  JAMES LEUTZE: But you were pretty confident about what you could do, that you were not gauging yourself by other people&#x27;s standards.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No, no, no, no. I didn&#x27;t have any guidelines or anything else. I just did—I did what seemed to be needed.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you have a lot of physical energy? Did you work long days? Did you work hard?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Worked hard, played golf. Used to go down to Pinehurst for the weekend, for a week after Christmas, take six horses. The first Mrs. Hill was quite a horsewoman; her father said she&#x27;d been born and raised on a horse from Baltimore. We had an old steeplechaser, and we had thoroughbreds, hunters. You would have thoroughbreds instead of run of the mill. Six horses, and of course, with Anne, we&#x27;d take them all over Virginia and South Carolina and show them in horse shows. I don&#x27;t know, we had plenty of time to go.  JAMES LEUTZE: But now you must have realized that you were being more successful than lots of people. Would you attribute that to intelligence, to energy, what would you attribute that to?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I … Again, I&#x27;m sorry to have to say, but I just never thought it one way or the other. I had enough income, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it. I didn&#x27;t have to make a living and it continued to appreciate all the time. And it&#x27;s amazing what&#x27;s happened since we had inflation. I look at the stock market and see Central Carolina Bank has gone from 15 three years ago to 37 1/2 yesterday. I look at it, sure I look at it, because I know every dollar it increases I know what it is and I got to change my will to take care of it [laughter] . I&#x27;m giving it away to the kids, the grandchildren,  and great grandchildren. And 4 or $500,000 a year gone so it won&#x27;t be in my estate. Sso you&#x27;ve got to think about those things. And you change your will; you check your will every year with attorneys. But I was able to take care of myself financially. I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot, but I had enough so I didn&#x27;t have to work for a living.  JAMES LEUTZE: But as you describe, though, the things that you do, I don&#x27;t want to get into this in too much detail at the moment, but you describe yourself as being constantly on the move, constantly thinking of new ideas, constantly creating whatever.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Whatever I developed, it needed this, that and the other thing. The bank was grown, it had grown to ten million dollars in &#x27;37, and 1/2 billion in 1986.  JAMES LEUTZE: When did the new Central Carolina Bank Building, when was that built?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: It was &#x27;37.  JAMES LEUTZE: This was in the midst of the Depression, Mr. Hill. Did you not realize that, by some people&#x27;s sights, this wouldn&#x27;t be a good time to be investing?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, no, the Depression was over.  JAMES LEUTZE: Oh, well, there were ups and downs but the Depression, measured by unemployment and other things, was …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We had the hotel by that time, and my father had bought the bonds from the widows and orphans, $384,000 as I remember the figures, at the time the hotel went bankrupt, the Old Washington Duke. Dad just walked in and handed over the $384,000 worth of bonds and took over the hotel. Period.  [END OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  [TAPE 3, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE B]  GEORGE WATTS HILL: You might say Durham was financially the gardenspot of North Carolina.  JAMES LEUTZE: Insulated, in a sense.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Insulated except for Raleigh because of the state government. And, no, the effect didn&#x27;t apply like it did to Winston-Salem. Well, Winston was pretty good because of Reynolds and insurance companies, but Asheville and other places were going to hell.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, did your attitude toward Franklin Roosevelt remain positive through this period? Let me tell you what this question is based on: some business people liked Roosevelt at the beginning but then, after his second election in &#x27;36, began to turn against him.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, I think that&#x27;s true. But you couldn&#x27;t do anything about it and had to put up with it. And you did the best you could. We had old Bob Doughton and others who were good congressmen. You just did in spite of it, you might say.  JAMES LEUTZE: Carl Durham must have been in …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Because he was a strong character. Oh, he was a congressman from the area, tall, lanky. But, no, you just functioned. That was Washington, that was way off yonder.  JAMES LEUTZE: Did you know that great New Yorker cartoon of the wealthy people dressed up in their tuxedos and one group is going by the other and they say, &quot;Come on, we&#x27;re going down to the theater to boo Franklin Roosevelt in the newsreels.&quot; Were there business people here who hated Franklin Roosevelt? Who thought the country was going to hell in a hand-basket? Socialism and communism were  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. But they didn&#x27;t make much noise one way or the other. We were busy.  JAMES LEUTZE: It was a Democratic state, too.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We were busy and much more interested in city government and state government and didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to federal government, as I remember.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now what was going on in the university? Did you have connection with the university formally during this late period?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My father had been a member of the board of trustees for forty-five or forty-eight years. I think he and I have been longer members of the university family, you might say, than any family in the state, in terms of service on the board, the controlling board. No, he used to come in with something scratched on an envelope and asked me to draw some plans for him, as chairman of the building committee. And I would. And we developed an organization of architect and contractor and engineer. The university built and cut the cost of building tremendously from $2300, as I remember, to $650 or something like that. And three dorms here, and four dorms there and three dorms there, Phillips Hall, the first of the women&#x27;s dorms and so on. And Emerson Field, and I remember Mr., oh, who was it that gave the new field, William Rand Kenan, Jr.  JAMES LEUTZE: Boshamer? I know there&#x27;s a Boshamer Field.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: No. Kenan. Bill Kenan, a classmate of my father&#x27;s. I was football manager. The things that bothered me more than anything else, I think, was the fact that I wouldn&#x27;t tell anybody that I injured my knee at prep school and therefore couldn&#x27;t play football.  JAMES LEUTZE: Why wouldn&#x27;t you tell anybody?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I don&#x27;t know, just one of those crazy things. I took it out vicariously as sub-assistant, then assistant, and then manager of football. Those were the good old days when we played in Emerson Stadium. No, I was big enough to play football and people used to ask, &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you playing football?&quot; And I never, well, would say why.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now in the 1930s, Frank Porter Graham was president.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Yeah, a great man.  JAMES LEUTZE: Yes, what were your relations?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: A great, great man. A great thinker. And Chase, before him as I remember, I not sure which, at the moment.  JAMES LEUTZE: I think before.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I think before. He was a very tall, very dignified person. I knew him well. And Frank Graham I knew extremely well and we worked together a great deal. My father was on the board and he didn&#x27;t like Frank at all, he didn&#x27;t like him, not the slightest.  JAMES LEUTZE: Was Frank too liberal?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, he just despised him because he was too liberal. And I, I liked him very much. And I thought I understood him and what he was trying to do. See, there were only 2300 students at Chapel Hill when I graduated and I left law school in &#x27;24. And no women, well, a few, at the time. And it was slowly developing. And back in the, what was it, the &#x27;50s here, I went on the trustee board and helped eventually elect, well, Gordon Grey who was very, not pompous, but very formal, formal is the best word for it. And we had a man in-between Gordon and Frank Graham, I don&#x27;t remember just exactly who was in there. But I was in and out of South Building all the time. And I was very much interested in the university before I was on the board and my father being on the board, there was a lapse of two years before I went on the board. And he got off the board eventually, he and Josephus Daniels and Judge Parker, as I remember. I don&#x27;t remember any of the other members of the board. They were the key people; they controlled the board. In those days, they operated the exec committee for a hundred members; a hundred members met twice a year, hell, it just didn&#x27;t amount to a hill of beans. But the exec committee met monthly and, when I served on the board, it met monthly with twelve people, and eventually fifteen people. And Bill Friday made a mistake, but that&#x27;s that, when he added some more to it. Then we had in &#x27;72, I think it was, the Board of Governors came in.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, I want to talk about that in some detail maybe next time. How about shifting gears for a few minutes and talk about the end of the 1930s and the on-coming of the Second World War, and what your reactions were in the late 1930s toward the rise of Adolf Hitler, and the needs that rose once Hitler attacked western Europe.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, Hitler was, I think what southern people realized, a devil incarnate and they just couldn&#x27;t believe anything he said one way or the other. He was going to take over the world. We organized the &quot;Committee to Defend America through Aid to the Allies&quot; but we were not in the war. England and France were and we understood why—it was self-preservation, no question about that. And McMillan, Harold McMillan, was Prime Minister, as I remember, in England. He damn near gave the world away. But in spite of him, others saved it.  JAMES LEUTZE: But there were lots of people in the United States and I&#x27;m sure here in this area, who felt that it was no business of the United States.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, no question. There was a very strong isolationist approach in spite of Roosevelt. The South slowly came along and became interventionist, I think it led the rest of the country. And all the middle West was a mess. I was in New York every week, Wednesday, every Wednesday, at the old University Club, and I forget the man who was the chairman of it- -Herbert Agar. But we worked, we didn&#x27;t go into the war until …  JAMES LEUTZE: &#x27;41 when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, December &#x27;41. But this we&#x27;re talking about, the committee was before the &quot;destroyer for bases&quot; vehicle, and so on.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, yeah. We sort of persuaded the president to give the fifty destroyers to England. They were old, yes, but they were effective. Seven hundred and fifty 75s: 75,000 machine guns, and 750,000 rifles, after Dunkirk. It was an interesting progression, I&#x27;ll never forget. And we shipped a lot of stuff. And in due course, that was World War I, and World War II was a different picture. No, that was World War II, sure, sure. World War I, I was too young.  JAMES LEUTZE: But now, why personally did you take an interest? I&#x27;ve wondered for instance, did your internationalism come from your parents? Did it come from your travel around the world? Where did it come from?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I think it was a combination. I&#x27;ll never regret having spent as much time as I had back in &#x27;24 and &#x27;25 to go around the world. It gave you a different approach to life and an understanding of a lot of damn things. But, no, it was Francis Miller, you know him?  JAMES LEUTZE: Yes, I&#x27;ve met him.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: From Virginia. Got me into the damn thing and also got me to know Whitney Shepardson.  JAMES LEUTZE: Dean Acheson was involved; I know he was a spokesman at some point.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I didn&#x27;t run into him.  JAMES LEUTZE: Joseph Alsop?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah. Joe, we fired. No it was another one we fired off the group because he talked too much—Bob Allen. We had British and French and Italian intelligence and Herbert Agar.  JAMES LEUTZE: Herbert Agar, that&#x27;s right; I&#x27;ve met him also.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Was acting as chairman of this group. I was one of the southern, the only southern member of the group. Joe Alsop. Bob Allen—oh, boy, we fired him. Joe Alsop was a very strong member.  JAMES LEUTZE: Very outspoken. I knew of his pro-British sentiments at the time. What was your impression of what Roosevelt really wanted to do at that time? Did you have the impression Roosevelt wanted to get into the war? Or what did you think he was thinking?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: I had the feeling that he was trying to bring the country along to an approach. I think he realized, and Jonathan and myself used to talk about it, that he realized that if we didn&#x27;t get in the war, we would be isolated, by ourselves. And I think he had a very definite plan that he was just working at the best he could under the circumstances. Pearl Harbor came along, that was a God-send to Roosevelt. There was no question, whang! that was it. No, it was a fascinating thing to me to see how this country just slowly changed from completely isolationist point of view to, they were ready. When Pearl Harbor came they were ready, they were ready to go. There was no question about it.  JAMES LEUTZE: This is an area that particularly intrigues me. Do you think—in studying it I see the same thing—do you think it was that they grew to see that the United States was too big and too powerful to stay out and that we did have an interest in this? Or do you think it was simply sympathy for Britain and a hatred of Hitler? Or was it …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, it was a combination. The South particularly understood the picture better than any other area.  JAMES LEUTZE: Why do you think that was?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, they&#x27;d had the hell beat out of them, for one thing, in the Civil War, and they&#x27;d just grown up with it. They were basically British and there was a French influence in various places. But it was a subconscious feeling of friendship; it was the mother country. I don&#x27;t think the far West and the middle West felt this way. They were just hell to bring into line. I&#x27;d say the South first, then the North, and then it went on across the nation.  JAMES LEUTZE: Of course, there were some isolationist congressmen. &quot;Bunk &#x27;em&quot; Bob Reynolds from western North Carolina  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, my God, yes. He was a bastard!  JAMES LEUTZE: … was opposed to aiding the allies.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: What&#x27;d he expect?  JAMES LEUTZE: [laughter] Well, anybody by name of &quot;Bunk &#x27;em&quot;  Bob you might. In fact, there were some suspicions that he was almost pro-fascist in his thinking. It wasn&#x27;t just that he was against us, it was that he thought maybe Hitler was on the right track and that was the way to go and it was OK.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, you&#x27;ve been into this so far deeper than I. I was just on the fringe of the whole thing.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, no, but you were there and you saw what was happening and what the attitudes and reactions were. And you invested a lot of time in this didn&#x27;t you? I mean, you say every Wednesday, but it must have taken a lot more time than that?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: For a year and a half, two years, there wasn&#x27;t another damn thing that I did. The local stuff was so much, oh you played with that, yes, you messed with it, you kept it going.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, what did your father think about this? Do you recall?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Well, he was older by then, of course. In &#x27;33 he was—graduated in &#x27;89—so that&#x27;d put him 68, born in &#x27;68 or something like that, at the end of the Civil War. That was &#x27;31 and &#x27;33, he was 65 or something, he was getting along. He&#x27;d been in the legislature.  JAMES LEUTZE: But did he ever say to you, &quot;Don&#x27;t get involved,&quot; and that sort of thing, &quot;that&#x27;s not your business.&quot; Or, &quot;You really ought to be doing…&quot;  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Never, never. He never tried to hold me down one way or the other. He never gave me any advice one way or the other, for or against.  JAMES LEUTZE: That&#x27;s interesting.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: We were always friends. Mother the same way. She was off on her business.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, I think we ought to conclude at this point.  [END OF TAPE 3, SIDE B]  [TAPE 4, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 4, SIDE A]  JAMES LEUTZE: You have a VCR I see. Have your figured out how to program that so that you …  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, at times. Sometimes I do.  JAMES LEUTZE: I have to look at the directions.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: My youngest son John is an electronic expert and he comes in to do that and the thing works. I have a hell of a time with the TV every now and then. I punch the wrong thing. Anne has to come in and play with it. She doesn&#x27;t know how, but she just does it.  JAMES LEUTZE: I&#x27;m very sympathetic. Today, Mr. Hill, I&#x27;d like to talk about your family and your recollections of your grandparents, and of your father, and of your early childhood. We started, I think, really talking about your college years, and we haven&#x27;t talked very much about your earlier childhood. So let&#x27;s go back to Duplin County, in at least 1869, and your father and your grandparents. What can you tell me about them?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: The Hill grandparents, the father was a great big man and was very active. They had 10,000 acres of land and I don&#x27;t know what happened to it. They don&#x27;t own it anymore anyhow. And my father was the youngest of eight children, I believe. One brother ran a savings and loan in Durham; One was consul in the consular service in Rio de Janeiro—Uncle Ed, great big fellow; another one was a doctor in Jersey City and came down eventually to North Carolina. He was married to a very important socialite in New York—very important, she thought—and he came down and ran Watts Hospital for three or four years or something and then went back. I don&#x27;t know why.  JAMES LEUTZE: Maybe she didn&#x27;t find Durham too sociable?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: And there were two unmarried sisters. And one of them always carried, Aunt Sally, always carried a comforter with her wherever she went; summer or winter she used that comforter, just like one of these characters.  JAMES LEUTZE: Linus in Peanuts.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Peanuts, that&#x27;s right. The same way. And they lived in Faison and died down there. And then the old house, the third house that was left—two were burned down by the Yankees. And Grandmother Hill was a little bitty woman. I always understood she came from Pepignon, France, which was close to the Spanish border; I don&#x27;t know about it.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, do you remember her?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, yeah, faintly. But she taught my father Latin and Greek before he went to college. She was very intellectual and her husband, he just retired and read Shakespeare and the Bible. Period. Sat on the porch with his hat on, I remember that. As a kid, I never thought about it until you asked the question. My father taught school in Faison before or after he came to Chapel Hill and I imagine it was after he came to Chapel Hill.  JAMES LEUTZE: Well, I think, from reading the little sketch you gave me in that little brochure Billy Carmichael apparently graduated from high school at 12 years old and then worked in a store. I think maybe he also taught a bit at that time because he graduated from high school and he thought he was too young to go college because he graduated at twelve. So it could have been in that time.  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Probably worked in the store there and taught for four years, as I remember the story. But my father was a great &quot;racconteur&quot; and he just loved to have somebody come in the house and, after we&#x27;d moved to the new house as we called it where the Junior League is now, he just loved to lay back in his chair. He had a chair in the corner with a light, and tell stories. Oh, he was something. And the kids were just pop-eyed listening to him.  JAMES LEUTZE: Now, did he talk much about his life when he was a young boy?  GEORGE WATTS HILL: Oh, he talked about everything. There was no subject that he didn&#x27;t know something about, whether he knew or not, but he told the story anyhow, and the kids just loved it. All kids up to twenty years of age and so on. And they&#x27;d just sit spellbound and at the table. He always sat at the head of the table and mother at the foot of the table. We gathered around and we always had dinner in the evening and had a little breakfast room where there was no problem; you could eat when you got damn good and ready. They had servants, three servants—a cook, a butler, and a maid—and a chauffeur. The stable was where the cows were in those days. We had raw milk, and I had to milk them, and always had three cows brought in from the farm.  JAMES LEUTZE:</dc:description>

<dc:description>/ f This is Ben Bulla interviewing Mrs. Jessie Wiley Voils/ at her home at 609 Morningside Drive in Wellington, Kansas.  I have just had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Voils, a very lovely lady.  We will be discussing the days that Everett Jordan spent here in Wellington before and a#teY WWI July 20, 1982 BB:  Mrs. Voils, to start, you might just tell me when and where you first met Everett Jordan. JV:  Well I came up from the little town of Hunnewell and that is down very close to the Oklahoma line.  We did not have a real highschoo down there so my family sent me up to Wellington to go to high school. When I got up here one of my first friends was Marie Sellers; and I will say that she was such a friendly person.  Mrs. Sellers, Marie&#x27;s mother, was a very active woman socially.  Where I think I had a stronger attachment wasj-the Congregational Church at that time was the church, so we all went to that church.  Marie and I just seemed to hit it off from the very first for some reason or other. I liked her very much; we were girlhood friends.  I discovered that her father had the Sellers Jewelry Store; he not only had the jewelry store, but he had a young relative by the name of Everett Jordan who had come out here to work for him.  Now to be perfectly honest, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to be, I thought he was an awful &quot;smart aleck&quot; [Webster: an obnoxiously conceited and cocky person].  Well, he kind of was; he really was that way. exactly Mrs. Sellers was into everything; now Fred Sellers wasn&#x27;t/that way, although he was different too.  He was different in this way: In those days we didn&#x27;t travel much, but let me tell you the Sellers traveled!  And not only that, but they traveled in a trailer that Fred Sellers made.  I can remember it so well--really it was a wonderful Jessie Wiley Voils j                     -2- thing that he made.  He worked with his hands very well.  So they would take these grand trips.  I do remember that Mrs. Sellers and Marie weren&#x27;t too keen about them because he would take them to the west coast and you know that in those early days there were no motels or anything like that; you had to stop and you had to camp and Fred liked to camp so that&#x27;s what they did. In the jewelry store, and it was a nice jewelry store, there was no question about that.  That&#x27;s where you went to get engagement rings and diamonds and what-have-you.  So they said that a young nephew was coming out from the East to work in Sellers Jewelry Store. That was Marie&#x27;s cousin--so I met him.  I can&#x27;t say that I was too impressed really, [laughs] and I don&#x27;t think he was with me, now he may say that he was, but I don&#x27;t really think that he was.  He lived with the Sellers, and his aunt was into everything and she was such a power in the Congregational Church that she just fairly ran that thing!  But her claim to local fame, and I must say that I have great respect for what Marie&#x27;s mother did, she remade our Park House.  I don&#x27;t know what it had been originally, but Mrs. Sellers took over that Park house and she turned it into what today we call a recreational center.  Oh, the things that she had down there.  One reason I remember them so well--there were no facilities for getting it clean--and everytime Mrs. Sellers would have something down there, and heavens knows, she would give one thing right after another--why it would fall to Marie and me to go down there the next day and help clean that place up.  Well I had never been quite used to doing that work, but if Marie had to go--I thought a lot of Marie--so down we&#x27;d go to clean out that Park house.  It was in that Park house that I met Everett.  I&#x27;ll Jessie Wiley Voils                       -3- never forget the night of this big party when I got this scar on my arm.  Everett was what I&#x27;d call a smart aleck; I&#x27;m sorry to tell you but the Everett that I knew in those days--well, a politician is kind of that way; come to think of it.  That&#x27;s probably the reason he could go to Washington, [laughs]  And I have always heard that he was wonderful with his constituents; that he never for-got them. Someone was reading an article about it and they said, &quot;Jordan might not be in on any legislation, but you let something come up that was important to his constituents then Everett was there--and Everett ti voted.  So I really think he made a good Congressman.  But he was kind of a wild boy as I remember him.  So Mrs. Sellers was giving one of her soirees down at the Park House--now as I remember, all we were having to eat was watermelon-- but that didn&#x27;t make any difference. Back then that was fine.  So Marie and I were there, and the &quot;cousin from the East&quot; was there.  At that time I sang with a quartet, and so I was leaning over with the quartet to sing with them and Everett, acting up--and I had all these curls--and he came over with the butcher knife that had been used to cut the watermelon up, and he leaned over me, lifted a curl, and I saw out of the corner of my eye, that here came this butcher knife at me!  I knew it was as sharp as a razor because Mrs. Sellers had it ready to cut the watermelon--so I threw up my arm to ward that off, as you would in a case like that, and down came that knife and severed the big artery in my arm.  Now that&#x27;s the last I remember--I don&#x27;t know how I got home because I immediately passed out.  They took me home--and I didn&#x27;t see Everett; I didn&#x27;t hear from Everett or anything until years and years and years later when his sister Margaret Sprinkle who was living in New York down close to Greenwich Village, and we lived nearby--so I got a call Jesjie Wiley Voils                       -4- from her and she said that Everett was going to be in town--and in the meantime my husband and I had been interested in the shops street around there where we lived on llth/and 5th Ave.  And so I had told Margaret about these auction shops that were all around there and later I learned that Everett and his wife liked to browse in those places--so we had that in common too--so as I said, Margaret called and said that she wanted me to come to dinner.  She said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you before you come, that Everett is going to be in town and he&#x27;ll be here.&quot;  Well I hadn&#x27;t seen him in years and years so I said, &quot;Well fine, that&#x27;s wonderful; it&#x27;ll be nice to see him.&quot;  And I meant it; I was glad to--to have the oppoturnity across the years.  My husband was working as a hotel manager in the evenings and couldn&#x27;t go so I went alone.  Well we had a nice visit and I was at the door getting ready to leave, and Everett said to me, &quot;Jessie, how did that place on your arm get?&quot; [laughs]  Now after all the years, that&#x27;s the only reference he made to it in any way.  And I said, &quot;Oh, Everett that got all right.&quot;  Of course, by that time--good heavens! it&#x27;s been years and years and it had grown over and it was all right.  It never bothered me after I recovered from the first whack. Now when he was here [in Wellington] I will tell you, he was popular with the ladies, but he didn&#x27;t go out much.  He stayed right there with his Uncle Fred, [telephone rings] His aunt, Mrs. Sellers, was so interested in everything that was going on in the town and she was really a power.  At times I think she even overpowered Fred, [laughs]  But she was a delight and everybody liked her; Louella Sellers.  She was so wonderful about starting things; I don&#x27;t mean she didn&#x27;t finish them--heavens knows she finished Jessie Wiley Voils                         -5- everything she started.  I think my main interest with Mrs. Sellers was; she was a Congregationalist and my friends went to the Congregational Church so I went to the little Congregational Church too. So we had that extra thing in common.  Now Everett--we were all interested when we heard that this boy was coming from the east to work for his uncle, naturally; but I don&#x27;t remember being too  impressed when he got here.  He was tall and thin; I will say that even as a very young man he was a wonderful worker.  He helped his uncle there in that store--I don&#x27;t think that Everett ever walked out of that store--and he was a good salesmanand it was a lovely jewelry store. That was in the days when jewelry stores were jewelry stores--they didn&#x27;t have a lunch counter in back or anything like that.  So I would say that while he was here he was a great blessing for his Uncle Fred. I want to show you the house where they lived.  Marie took the top off of it--Marie was always doing thingsI&#x27;ll tell you exactly how it used to look.  She changed it after Mrs Sellers was gone, of course Fred Sellers died first, and I will say that Everett came back to be with Marie; I think he was a person that she adored as long as she lived.  I&#x27;m sure of that..........Everett.....I was interested in him, I knew he had become a United States Senator and I did hear what a good one he was.  That if anything came up that concerned his constituents he was right there voting as his people wanted him to vote. But to go back to the time that he was here in Wellington--you&#x27;ve heard the expression &quot;cutting a swath&quot;? Well, I will say that when we heard that Marie&#x27;s cousin was coming out from the east--and gosh you&#x27;d have thought they were coming from New York City--we were all interested.  However when he got here, I think we were also a little disappointed.  He wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call a handsome boy, but he was Jessie Wiley Voils -6- vivacious and I would say very good in that store,  His uncle must have been pleased with him.  I&#x27;m just sure that he was pleased with Everett.  He was a hard worker--from the time he came out to help his Uncle Fred he was right in there in that store.  Way back then when I was in high school I didn&#x27;t have any money to spend on jewelry so I wasn&#x27;t in there very much except I knew from what the people in the town said you know, that Everett Jordan was helping his uncle-- and it was the best jewelry store in town...... BB:  Did Everett ever give you any jewelry of any kind? JV:  Oh no. [laughs]  I would probably have said to him, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t take that.&quot;  But anyway...I know when this accident occured--good gosh! he didn&#x27;t even come to see me!!  And I was at home because they had to call the doctor and I had my arm straight out for a long time. BB JV BB JV Were you here or in Hunnewell? Hueell.,/y.,./t, 4Ar &#x27;,&gt;, hiA    h^r.%    ,, How far is that from here?                           A/&#x27;^*-*./#v&lt;fT&lt;v Oh it&#x27;s just about gone now.  It&#x27;s down near the state line.....   /j.&#x27;. BB:  Were you here when Everett came back after the war? JV:  .....I was born in 1900 and I came here in 1914 and he came here the first time around 1916--then when I finished high school I went to Emporia Teacher&#x27;s College, and taught then. No, I did not see him after the war. BB:  Did you correspond with him during the war? JV:  No.  No.  No correspondence a&#x27;tall. BB;  Did he ever give you his picture? JV:  No.  No.  Nothing like that a&#x27;tall.  As a matter of fact, I Jessie Wiley Voils                           -7- didn&#x27;t like him very well to tell you the truth.  Looking back, I&#x27;d say that now.  Now at the time, when he had whacked the big artery in my arm, I thought that at least Everett could have sent me some flowers, or called up to see about me; he didn&#x27;t do anything of the kind.  I never heard from him a&#x27;tall. BB:  That&#x27;s quite a change because in later years he was most thoughtful and courteous... JV:  [laughing and interrupting] yes, kind of a ladies&#x27; man maybe later; but no, no he didn&#x27;t call, I didn&#x27;t hear from him at all.  I will say that I know he hadn&#x27;t forgotten it though [tells again about BEJ asking about her arm years later at a dinner party in NY] I will tell you that everybody here liked him when he worked in his uncle&#x27;s store. BB:  They tell stories about his Uncle Fred; they say he was quite a storyteller; that he liked to fish; and wasn&#x27;t too devout about going to church.  He had rather fish than to go to church on Sunday, I understand.  Is this generally true? JV:  Yes, I would say that it is.  Mrs. Sellers was such a power in the Congregational Church that she would have liked to have had him and to hunt. go, but he didn&#x27;t.  He did like to fish/  Then he had a shop fixed up at home and he made the first camping trailer that I ever saw.  Now he didn&#x27;t patent it--he really should have.  It was like some of the present day things; it opened up and then the tent comes down and you had a travel tent.  They took some wonderful trips in that.  I don&#x27;t think that Everett ever went along. I will tell you that when Marie&#x27;s cousin came out from the east, it did cause quite a little excitement.  Our town was small and the Sellers were one of our leading families; there&#x27;s no doubt about that Jessie Wiley Voils                           -8- and they were strong Congregationilists............... BB:  We&#x27;ve talked about how Everett Jordan looked; about his personality; did you ever have any discussions with him about anything in particular? JV:  Oh goodness no!  You didn&#x27;t discuss anything with Everett, [tape runs out] ...........this young man coming out from the east caused quite a flutter, but it soon subsided because Everett wasn&#x27;t the kind to cause much of a sensation. BB:  Did you see him very much? JV:  Oh yes, I saw him quite a little because Marie and I were such close friends. BB:  Did he ever discuss any news with you? JV:  No.  Heavens we didn&#x27;t have any news at that time.  But if he had tried to discuss it with me I probably wouldn&#x27;t have knowjywhat the guy was talking about. When did you say he was here the second time? BB:  After WW1, around 1919 or 1920.   He stayed until 1922. JV:  Well I went to Emporia Teachers College and then I taught down in Oklahoma; so you see I was away from Wellington at that time.  So it&#x27;s his first visit that I remember. BB:  And you had no correspondence with him while he was overseas? JV:  Oh no, no.  Not a&#x27;tall.  As a matter of fact, I had a boyfriend that I later married.  That was Willard Vayle-s.; and I will tell you this:  When we had that tragic accident down at the Park House when I threw up my arm to ward off this razor-sharp knife that &quot;Mr. Smart Aleck&quot; was acting like he was going to whack off one of my curls... my left forearm.....so when I came-to, back at my aunt&#x27;s house, Willard was sitting with me, and when I saw him I said, &quot;Oh Willard, I think Jessie Wiley Voils                           -9- you better go home.&quot;  They always teased me about this afterwards because I discovered that my boyfriend was thereto whom I was happily married for some 55 years later. BB:  Was Willard from Wellington also? JV:  Yes.  He was Willard Hunter Voils; his mother was a Hunter.  Their old home still stands down on South Washington where they came from, but the big homethe big Hunter home is gone.  It&#x27;s been gone for a number of years.  It covered a half a block and that gorgeous old home stood there I don&#x27;t know when they did tear it down but it was the showplace of Wellington.  It belonged to Willard&#x27;s grandfather who was the mayor for--I don&#x27;t know how long--and did an awful lot for Wellington.  So that uh--Everett wouldn&#x27;t have stood much chance with me at that time in my life if he had been interested in me; but I didn&#x27;t think that he was a&#x27;tall.  Heavens knows after what he did to me I wasn&#x27;t too keen about him!  Not that I thought anything about it  after I came to, and sent my boyfriend homehorrified that he had been there through the time that they were sewing me upwhy Iuh  forgot the whole thing.  It was a terrible scar for a long time but I hardly thought of it.  [the scar was right above the elbow on the left arm] BB:  Was that the last time you saw him then? JV:  Yes. BB:  Did you ever date him any at all? JV:  No.  Never had a date.  As a matter of fact, I wouldn&#x27;t have gone out with him because at the time I knew himoh fiddle-de-deewell in the first place I had a &quot;steady&quot; and let me tell you my steady didn&#x27;t desert me in my hour of need; he stayed right with me, and I guess helped to take me home. Jessie Wiley Voils 10- BB:  Did you go to the party with Willard? JV:  Yes. BB:  Do you remember any more escapades concerning Everett? JV:  No, but he was quite a boy when he was here, I&#x27;ll tell you that. BB:  He didn&#x27;t go to church either did he?  Didn&#x27;t he go fishing with his Uncle Fred on Sunday? JV:  I think he did.  No I never saw him in church. BB:  I understand that his father was concerned about his not going to church and fishing on Sunday. JV:  Well I expect that&#x27;s true; however I want to say something for Fred Sellers:  The whole town liked him an awful lot.  As a matter of fact they liked him better than they did Mrs. Sellers.  He was a genial person and oh, they did nice things for the town. BB:  Back in those days, what was Wellington like? JV:  It was a charming little townjust a charming little town.  When I go downtown now I&#x27;m just hartsick at what&#x27;s going on.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen to all these fast food places that are up there on North A  we&#x27;ve got too many of them.  We can&#x27;t keep those things going; we just haven&#x27;t got the population for it.  When we moved back here, Wellington Main Street was much nicer than it is nownow we&#x27;ve got this big black cable running everyplace and they tell me that&#x27;s for cable television. BB:  When did you come back to Wellington? JV:  We&#x27;ve been back here about 15 years.  We didn&#x27;t intend to stay when we came back but all these years-my husband had inherited quite a lot of land here and so we would come back for harvest.  We lived right on Manhattan Island and that&#x27;s no place for an older person, if one isn&#x27;t well, and we had been looking around in the east, so when we Jessie Wiley Voils                           -11- came out here and we found the George Wrennshis mother had been in the Congregational Church too--so they said, &quot;Oh why don&#x27;t you move back*.&#x27; and so, then there wasn&#x27;t a house to be had and we finally found this little house and we had big plans for itwe were going to put another bath and a large living room with a fire place on the back. But my husband got worse and we didn&#x27;t do anything.  And it is today a nice little town.  It&#x27;s a good place for an old lady to end her days. BB:  How many children do you have? JV:  Just the one daughter.  She and her husband live in New York City. ...........my birthday on memorial day....82nd birthday.....until I had this stroke I was very active..that was four years ago...I had a cousin in Oklahoma City who was a wonderful doctor and he came right up. BB:  Tell me something about your career in New York JV:  I was with the Delineator Magazine and I went from there to Pictorial Review and wrote for them; and then I wrote for NBC and did quite a lot of broadcasting. BB:  What type of broadcasting? JV:  Well I wrote my own stuff--! did one series, &quot;Highways to Famous Homes&quot; which lasted for quite a long time.  I was very active in NY. I also  worked for McCallsback then that was a wonderful magazine, and so was Pictorial Review. BB:  Did you write feature articles for them? JV:  Oh, I just wrote, period.  I loved to write.  At that time my husband had this friend who was a Christian Scientist and he became interested and I studied Christian Science with him because I thought it was helping him; but I never was a good one--I never could whole- Jessie Wiley Voils                           -12- heartedly go in, and I finally gave that up and so did he.  During that time though, I wrote for the Christian Science Monitor.  I wrote on assignment for them for quite a while.  I remember one time I went to West Point for their graduation--they gave me some very interesting assignments. BB:  Have you written some books? JV:  I have one.  I had another almost finished when I had this stroke and I destroyed it. BB:  What a shame. JV:  I don&#x27;t think so.  Later, my granddaughter, who is interested in writing, thought she might be interested in finishing itbut nobody can finish a book for you and do it the way you, yourself would do. So I&#x27;m glad that I burned that bridge. BB:  What is the name of the book that you finished? JV:  Summer on the Salt^ Fork.  It&#x27;s the story of my maternal grandparents and their coming out to Kansas.  They came in the 80&#x27;s and I remember that they came in a covered wagon --my grandmother&#x27;s name was Georgia Elizabeth--and they were Southern sympathizers.  She came out here with a three weeks old baby.....Then my grandfather bought land it was so cheap then, maybe a dollar and a half an acre.  Right down near the border, just over the Kansas line fronOklahoma.  At that time, Oklahoma was the Indian territory. BB:  Your book is sort of a biography? JV:  Yes it is in a way.  I drew heavily on stories my mother had told me. BB:  Is it a fictional biography? JV:  No, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a biography a&#x27;tallits fiction based on their experiences when they first came out to Kansas. Jessie Wiley Viols                           -13- .....yes I would say that while he was staying with his Uncle Fred that his uncle had a great influence on him. BB:  Did they have any traits in common? JV:  Yes they must have or they wouldn&#x27;t have had such a good time together.  In working in the jewelry store they seemed to get along beautifully.  I don&#x27;t think he would have come out and stayed with Uncle Fred if they hadn&#x27;t had many traits in common.  I think they did. I&#x27;m interested in what you&#x27;ve told meI never knew that he was a minister&#x27;s son I don&#x27;t believe.  It was never discussed--or I could have forgotten............... BB:  Did you ever go on any outings with Everett? JV:  No.  No. BB:  Did you ever go to the movies with him? JV:  I don&#x27;t think we had movies back then.  We had &quot;socials&quot; at the Congregational Church. BB:  Church suppers? JV:  Yes. Oh, yes! BB:  Did Everett come to any of those? JV:  I&#x27;m sure he was there but I don&#x27;t remember. BB:  Uncle Fred would have come wouldn&#x27;t he? JV:  Well, yes I would say soif his wife was going and wanted him to goI&#x27;d say that he would.  Yeah.  Uncle Fred was well liked here in Wellington.  Everybody liked him. BB:  Uncle Fred never went to church&#x27;,did he? JV:  No I think it was his wife--you know in those days that&#x27;s the way it was.  The wife kept up that side--I don&#x27;t know if she was trying to get him into heaven too--but most of the times it was the wives that /Jssie Wiley Voils                           -14- i. kept the phtirch things going........... ......I don&#x27;t remember that anything was ever said about it a&#x27;tall. BB:  Did your parents ever meet him? JV:  No. BB:  Were your parents ranchers or what? JV:  They were farmers.  Yes they raised wheat.  One of my earliest memories, and I don&#x27;t think I was but about four years old, was standing between my mother and father while they were looking out over this wheatfieldmother had one of my hands and father the other and I realized that they were very sad; but I didn&#x27;t know why.  What it was; a hailstorm had come when the wheat was just about ready to harvest and it was lost.</dc:description>

BEJ Alice McLean June 1, 1982 Ben Bulla&#x27;s Office, Saxapahaw, NC BB: Alice, you lived with the Jordan family for many years and worked as Mr. Jordan&#x27;s secretary for X number of years and probably know him as well as anyone except his wife.  So let&#x27;s go back to the time when you first met him.  Where did you first see him? A. McLean:  I met him when he was courting Katherine. BB:  Tell me what you remember about him as a young man.  How did he look, etc. A. McLean:  I was younger and I don&#x27;t really remember much about how he looked.  I remember that she had several other beaus along with him and as well as I remember he was the most attractive; both in looks and manner or personality.  She went with a doctor that was a very fine person but he didn&#x27;t have the personality that Everett did.  She went with a lawyer from Charlotte; there again he did not have the personality that Everett did.  Everett was somebody that you would like.  He was easy to know--to get acquainted with. BB:  How would you describe his personality? A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t remember.  I was too young to be in the wedding. I do know that he had a very good rapport with my father.  I guess Katherine told you that when Everett came to see her, sometimes my father would come in and she would go to sleep while they were -                                                                                                                                     i sitting there talking to each other. BB:  Why did your father like him so much? A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t know, but evidently he liked him very much. BB:  Did it bother Katherine that he talked to your father so much? A. McLean:  Yes.  She would curl up and go to sleep while Everett was talking to our father. A. McLean                                             -2- BB:  Why did you come to Saxapahaw? A. McLean:  It was during the depression and Everett offered me a job and I needed one.  I had gone two years to college and I felt like it was not the thing to do to go on to college when my father did not have the money to send me.  In fact May helped out the last year I was in school. BB:  You stayed with the Jordans from the first day that you came? A. McLean:  Yes. BB:  What job did you do when you came here? A. McLean:  I did a little bit of everything.  I did his letters of course, I helped with the payroll--just did anything there was to be done.  Frank Love was here at that time and I believe he worked in the office. BB:  You wrote his letters.  I heard that he wrote mostly business letters.  Did he ever write any personal letters? A. MeLean:  He wrote to Marie Sellers and Fred--and he always loved to write thank-you letters at Christmas time.  I thought his thank you notes were always too long, but he didn&#x27;t think so and he would never miss thanking someone for something and he was very prompt. BB:  What did you think his strong traits were? A. McLean:  He was a hard workerbut he was considerate also.  He expected you to do your job. BB:  Did he ever praise you? A. McLean:  Zj7augh&amp;7  I don&#x27;t remember that Ben.  I thought that he appreciated my efforts but I don&#x27;t think he ever said so in so many words. BB:  What sort of things would upset him? A. McLean -3- A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t know.  Speaking of lettersin the early years he would write customers and thank them for their orders; I don&#x27;t think he did that in later years. BB:  What would provoke him? A. McLean:  I can&#x27;t think of anything right now.  I&#x27;m sure things bothered him but I don&#x27;t remember what. BB:  What kind of self control did he have? A. McLean:  I would say he had good self-control.  As you know, he was a leader; he had to be.  HSXKXHXX8XKKX8KXX He ran the family business and he had to be on top of it.  He wanted to know everything that was going on.  I think maybe that was the reason it was hard for the boys. He didn&#x27;t mean to be that way because he loved the boys and it was not his intention not to give them authority but he was born that way and wanted to work things through in his be own way.  It would/hard for anybody else to come in and try to take charge. BB:  You mentioned that he wanted to know everything that was going on.  How did he do this.  How did he learn what was going on? A. McLean:  By being right there where it was I would think. BB:  When he was not here? A. McLean:  I Presume he called in and had men that he depended on while he was gone.  You know he would go to Hot Springs and to Europe several times-r-that was while he was still here before he went to Washington. BB:  I&#x27;ve heard it said that he relied heavily upon you to keep him advised of a lot of things.  Is this correct? A. McLean:  Well I don&#x27;t knowhe might have asked me questions /.stammers around? about things he would want to know Zlaughji?.  I don&#x27;t think I ever tattled on anybody. A. McLean                                                -4- BB:  I understand--he had to get information from people. A. McLean:  Yes, well I&#x27;m sure he did rely on me.  Well he knew I knew what was going on.  That was back in the days when there wasn&#x27;t so much red tape, etc, that you could do more.  Now you couldn&#x27;t if you wanted to I wouldn&#x27;t think. BB:  You mentioned Joe Neel; who were some of the employees in the mill that he relied upon.  A lot of people said that they had a very close rapport with him. A. McLean:  Al Cohens, A. T. Davis... BB:  Red McAdams? A. McLean:  Yes I would think so.  Certainly. BB:  Did the Perry girls have that contact? A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t know about that.  He was crazy about Red, but I dont know if he would ask her questions like he would me or not. BB:  What pleased him? A. McLean:  /Long pausjj?  Of course when business was good he was happy; and loved to have people around him.  You know he used to take people over to the house for meals.  He loved to be around people. You remember Jim Anthony, how he would go out to the house, when he was with A. M. Pullen.  He would go to the house a lot to eat, he was very fond of him. BB:  What did he discuss around the dinner table? A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t know,off hand.  It&#x27;s according to who was there whether it was business or familyand of course politics was in it a lot. BB:  When just the family was there--what was the topic.  Did he take this time to scold or reprimand.....? A. McLean ---------                                             -5- A. McLean:  No, not really.  As well as I remember, eating there as a family was a pleasant thing; it wasn&#x27;t something that you just got through with and left.  As a matter of fact Katherine wouldn&#x27;t let the children leave until everyone was finished. BB:  Alice, the three children grew up while you were there.  With Mrs. Jordan gone quite a bit, what role did you play in their upbringing? A. McLean:  Well they could leave because they knew I was there and certainly could look after the children.  Of course they had colored help too.  Jenny stayed there, and Ralph Miller stayed there. There were living quarters down in the basement.  So it wasn&#x27;t like I was having to do a lot of menial chores for the children. BB:  Did you instruct them or advise them.  Were you like a second mother telling them what to do and what not to do? A. McLean:  I felt responsible, but I don&#x27;t remember much about advising and that sort of thing.  We had time together--! don&#x27;t think they disliked me. Alice Daniels came a lot.  She was a teacher, and at one time lived in Oxford.  She was supposed to be a missionary but on account of her health she couldn&#x27;t; she taught school in Gastonia.  Lived in our home for a while in Gastonia.  Katherine would get her to come and stay while they were away. Miss Edith, my stepmother, would come and stay some too.  I stayed don&#x27;t think I ever sXaqs with them just by myself for any length of time. BB:  How did the children behave.  Just like most kids? A. McLean:  Right.  They were just children as well as I can remember. A. McLean                                              -6- BB:  Did you have to discipline them any yourself? A. McLean:  No, I don&#x27;t think so.  Of course John and Ben and Rose Anne all went off to prep school fairly early when they were like 13 or 14.  That would be the time when they probably would need discipline. BB:  Did you enjoy living in their home? A. McLean:  Oh yes. BB:  If you had it to do over what would you do differently? A. McLean:  /LaughsT? Oh I don&#x27;t know; I really don&#x27;t. BB:  Do you have any regrets about coming to Saxapahaw? A. McLean:  Oh no.  In our Bible study we were reading about Lot&#x27;s wife.  You&#x27;re not supposed to look back. BB;  We have talked about Mr. Jordan&#x27;s strong points.  Did he have any weak points? A. McLean:  Well I&#x27;m sure he did Ben but I don&#x27;t remember any outstanding ones that was  noticible to me. BB:  Do you remember any favorite expressions or things he said that were unique? A. McLean:  No.  They use to tell when_____________was spending the night, he&#x27;d say, &quot;You can&#x27;t complain because I&#x27;m not charging you anything.&quot;  You&#x27;ve heard that story I&#x27;m sure.  I&#x27;ve heard it a lot. He would tell funny stories and laugh just as much as the ones he was telling it to. BB:  What was his source for the funny stories? A. McLean:  One of his sources was his Uncle Fred Sellers.  He quoted him a lot. BB:  How would you describe him as a person? A. McLean                                                -7- A. McLean:  /Long pause&quot;/  I&#x27;d have to think about that Ben.  I just don&#x27;t know. BB:  How about Mr. S Mrs. JOrdan as husband and wife? A. McLean:  Hummmmm.  Would that be on there (recorded)?  They were devoted to each other.  In fact I think hewas not more devoted, but Katherine had grown up in an era when my father had money and they were real close.  He called her &quot;Kitten&quot; and he petted her not the right expressionand Everett carried that on.  He was very solicitous; he humored her; she got what she wanted.  I don&#x27;t mean that in a grasping sense.  He respected her wishes. BB:  How did he show this.  Through gifts? A. McLean:  No not through gifts /Taughs?., because he wasn&#x27;t that kind.  I remember the story they used to tell that this doctor would bring Katherine candy when he was courting her, and Everett would come to eat Dr. Weathers candy. He didn&#x27;t give her things in particular, but if she wanted something he didn&#x27;t object.  That is so far as I know; she might have a different story on that.  That was my impression. BB:  When they would have an argument, who would win? A. McLean:  Gosh I didn&#x27;t hear them argue.  As far as arguing and fussing they did very little. BB:  Did they always agree on everything they discussed? A. McLean:  Well I don&#x27;t know that they always agreed, but they were not the kind to jaw back and forth.  They got along very well together I thought. You&#x27;ve heard the story of them going up to Uncle Charlie&#x27;s and Aunt Annie&#x27;s every Sunday and taking the children and putting one of them in the bathtub to sleep; they wouldn&#x27;t have to worry A. McLean                                              -8- about the baby crawling out while they were eating.  They ate with them about every Sunday night.  They would take trips with Charlie and Annie too.  They went to the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago I believe. They took several trips with them.  You see they had no children and Everett was just like a son to them.  In fact he was the one that asked him about moving down here.. j     _                                                                                                &#x27;                                                                                                                                                     . BB:  How would you describe the relationship between the children and Mr. Jordan? A. McLean:  Hummmmm.  I don&#x27;t know Ben.  /Tong pause?  You mean while they were children don&#x27;t you. BB:  Yes.  Was their relationship close or casual or what? A. McLean:  I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t remember. BB:  Was Mr. JOrdan the disciplinarian? A. McLean:  I just don&#x27;t remember.  I do remember Everett spanking John one time because he didn&#x27;t answer him.  He was up on the hill and said he didn&#x27;t hear him, but Everett said he did so he spanked him.  Ithought that was terrible.  That&#x27;s about all I remember. BB:  Do you remember anything amusing that happened at the house? -, A. McLean:  Rose Anne makes a good story out of the time he set up an account for her at the bank.  You will have to get her to tell that story. BB:  Did he have a favorite among the three children? A. McLean:  If he did it was Rose Anne.  She&#x27;s a lot like him.  She f . I    is a leader. BB:  Alice, of the three children, which is most like him today? A. McLean:  I suppose maybe it would be Rose Ann; I had never thought about it like that. A. McLean                                                -9- :  In what respect was she like him? A. McLean;  She likes to be a leader in my opinion.  She likes to be in the forefront.  It&#x27;s just her nature.  She&#x27;s notshe dosn&#x27;t give the appearance of being modest, but maybe that&#x27;s a buffer of her real feelings.  I don&#x27;t know. .  :  ,-</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>At the time of this 1985 interview, J. Randolph Taylor was just leaving his Charlotte pastorate to assume the presidency of San Francisco Theological Seminary (SFTS). At the beginning of the interview, Taylor explains the influence his parents, particularly his father, had on him. Until his mother died when he was three, his family lived in China&#x27;s Kiangsu province. At that point, his father moved the family back to the United States, but Taylor values his early exposure to the non-Western church. After college, Taylor and his wife Arline went to Scotland so he could study the works of James Denney under New Testament theologian Archibald M. Hunter. After he earned his degree, the Taylors returned to America, where he took a pulpit at the Church of the Pilgrims in Washington, D.C. During that time, Taylor became aware of his own racism and decided that &quot;guilt is not an adequate response.&quot; With the Reverend Jefferson Rogers, he helped launch the Washington Branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and through that organization, he met Martin Luther King Jr. Shortly before King&#x27;s death, Arline and Randolph moved to Atlanta to lead Central Presbyterian Church, and he formed a partnership between his congregation and King&#x27;s church. These experiences convinced him only interracial cooperation would solve America&#x27;s racial problems, but he was one of the only whites involved in the SCLC. He helped found A Fellowship of Concern--a Presbyterian anti-racist organization--as a way to increase the participation of white churchgoers in these efforts. At this point in the interview, Taylor examines how various church organizations, especially seminaries, congregations, and the Presbyterian denominations handled desegregation. Taylor believes that his immersion in southern life was an advantage because he not only attacked injustice but also helped heal the wounds that the Civil Rights Movement left. By 1985, Taylor believed the American church needed to address more than racial inequality, and he explains which areas remain and the theological reasons for choosing those areas. Moving from that topic, he expounds upon his foundational beliefs. One of Taylor&#x27;s most important denominational roles was when he co-chaired the Joint Committee on Presbyterian Union, and he clarifies how the committee reconciled the doctrinal, structural, philosophical and racial differences between the church&#x27;s Northern and Southern branches. He offers his perspective on the ecumenical movement and its benefits. Over the last half of the twentieth century, conservative evangelicalism grew in influence among the mainline churches, and Taylor considers why it spread, what its benefits are and what pitfalls denominations must avoid. He ends the interview by looking forward to his new post at SFTS, explaining what he hopes to accomplish there.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  BRUCE KALK: … if you could discuss your personal background, your family, where you grew up and where you were born, this sort of thing.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I was born in China, in Kiangsu province in north China, the son of Presbyterian missionaries. My mother&#x27;s family were from North Carolina and Virginia, my father&#x27;s from South Carolina. My mother died when I was three years old, so that my father bundled up his four boys, of which I was the third, and came back to North Carolina to be with her family, and so my first memories are really of Charlotte, North Carolina, where I now serve as a pastor. I grew up in part here and in part in Charleston, South Carolina, and then in Nashville, Tennessee. I went to public schools in Charleston, South Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee, and then spent my summers during all those years in Montreat, a Presbyterian conference center outside Asheville, and with visits pretty regularly to Charlotte. I&#x27;ve always had a deep feeling of identification with North Carolina. Not surprisingly, I went to Davidson College, which is a Presbyterian school, and my family had been intimately associated with it. My great-great-grandfather was the first President of Davidson College, so these roots go way back in North Carolina soil and history. I met my wife in Montreat, and we were married in her home in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1951 and then went to Union Seminary in Richmond, Virginia, where I received the theological degree and then went to the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and got my Ph.D. degree. I returned to this country in 1956 and went to Washington, D.C., where I was pastor of the Church of the Pilgrims, an inner city church near Dupont Circle, a fascinating experience. I was there eleven years, all during the civil rights struggle and the beginning of the Vietnam struggle. I moved from there to Atlanta, Georgia, where I was pastor of Central Presbyterian Church, right across the street from the State Capitol and the City Hall and so forth, and again [had] fascinating experiences in terms of community involvement, and was there for a period of almost nine years. Then I came here to Charlotte in 1976 and have been here now for nine years as pastor of Myers Park Church. It&#x27;s like coming home, and it&#x27;s also been a valuable experience for me to work with a very established church, a kind of flagship church for southern Presbyterians, and my ministry has been one of seeking to help and assist and enable this congregation of leaders in the community and business and political life to identify their involvement in the church with their involvement in the community and the moral underpinnings for social and personal involvement. At the same time, I&#x27;ve been heavily involved in the whole matter of Presbyterian reunion, and that&#x27;s a whole different subject, but that&#x27;s engaged me a great deal since I&#x27;ve been here. You may know that I have just accepted a call and will be leaving in June of this year to go to San Francisco, California, where I&#x27;ll be President of San Francisco Theological Seminary, and so we are building a house up outside Montreat, and that will be our anchor in the East. In fact, the call to San Francisco includes a specific item of a leave of absence at Christmas and New Year&#x27;s in order to be able to spend the holidays with family in North Carolina. That&#x27;s specifically noted in the call, so that they on the west coast are aware that our roots are here, and we will return to Montreat as an anchor in the eastern part of the country.  BRUCE KALK: I&#x27;m not sure that we know what year you were born and when you were growing up.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I was born January 12, 1929. I&#x27;m fifty-six years old.  BRUCE KALK: What writers and thinkers have influenced the development of your thought, Dr. Taylor?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: The thinkers who have influenced my thought most significantly are persons with whom I was intimately associated or whom I knew personnaly. One, frankly, was my father, who was a very strong individual with pastoral instincts and a vision of the church that carried him to China as a missionary and then brought him back to this country, and he was in charge of our World Mission Program for some years. He was the dominant male influence in my life, I&#x27;m sure. He died in our home here in Charlotte about five years ago, and there&#x27;s no question but that his writings, which were not great, but our conversations were a very, very substantial influence upon me. The professor in Aberdeen, Scotland, under whom I studied was Archibald M. Hunter, a New Testament scholar who has written extensively, and I had an almost ideal academic setting for graduate studies. I would covet that for you or for anybody involved. Dr. Hunter was in the United States just about the time I was graduating from Union Seminary in Richmond, and I had a fellowship and was going somewhere and didn&#x27;t know where. And he suggested that I come and study with him up in Aberdeen and work on a project that he was fascinated with, and that is the rediscovery of a Scottish theologian named James Denney, so I agreed to do this. Arline and I arrived in Aberdeen, up in the northeastern part of Scotland. We were the first Americans to go there for graduate study. Dr. Hunter met our train and carried us to our flat and presented me with my books. He had been to all the used book stores and gotten all of James Denney&#x27;s works, had already bought them and presented them to me and said, &quot;Now this is your reading material. You can start tomorrow morning.&quot; And that began a period of about two and a half years when he and I were together every day, either for tea in the afternoon or for a game of golf or for just a walk through the city of Aberdeen or the hills around it, almost an ideal setting of one-on-one, and working together on a common interest, so that in retrospect that was a very fortunate experience for me. A.M. Hunter was a formative influence on my life. Through books, in terms of the field of theology and so forth, the most significant influences have been Karl Barth and Emil Bruner. Both of those are Continental theologians whose influence was pretty pervasive on my generation of theological students. In this country, supremely the Niebuhrs, Reinhold Niebuhr and Richard Niebuhr, were the influences in shaping my theology, but nothing quite so dominant as those personal contacts with those two strong individuals while I was growing up and in graduate study. The other person I&#x27;d have to mention is that man whose name I mentioned in terms of his work, James Denney, a man whom I never met but whom I know better than anybody [laughter] , because I spent those years of graduate study digging into his  life and his mind and his times, and I find increasingly that has shaped a good bit of my thinking. The interesting thing about him was that he was a man ahead of his time, and he anticipated much of neo-orthodoxy and what you find, to some extent, in the work of the Niehuhrs was anticipated somewhat in Denny&#x27;s work. Now I should also add, though, that when I came away from Scotland in &#x27;56, I was a Biblical scholar and a kind of teaching preacher. By a strange providence I ended up in Washington, D.C. as my first pastorate, and it was in &#x27;56, the beginning, really, of the civil rights struggle. I was in an inner city parish that became increasingly aware of the difficulties of the structures and the systems of a major metropolitan area, so that my first parish shaped an additional concern for me, and that is the whole matter of social change and the whole matter of how you affect social change without destroying a community and its structures. And there I would say that there have been a combination of influences. Again, one comes out of one&#x27;s own personal experience. The person who probably shaped me most helpfully during that time was Martin Luther King, Jr. I came to know him personally and can tell you about that if that&#x27;s an interest to follow up. But through his writings as well as through being a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with him, he was a major shaper in a different area, and there are others who have helped me in terms of the whole field of social dynamics.  BRUCE KALK: Let&#x27;s turn to this question then, if you could comment a little more in depth on your involvement in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and your relationship with Martin Luther King.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I grew up in the South, so that I was aware of the difficulty, the distance between the races, and I can tell you a whole lot more than you want to know about what it means. Did you grow up in the South? Well, it was fascinating. In fact, I shared with a group of North Carolinians up near Asheboro just on Tuesday of this week my whole pilgrimage in terms of racial attitudes. It&#x27;s fascinating to reflect back on how I was unconsciously conditioned toward a kind of cultured racism. I wasn&#x27;t a race-baiter and I never saw a lynching. The brutality of the relationships was to me a subject that I came on in academic studies of the history of the South. But I experienced the distance between the races and never quite understood why it was and was told it was a matter of education and so forth. But it was not really until I got into Washington, which was then a predominantly black community under the control of Congress at that time without any right to vote; the citizens of the District had no right to vote. It was ruled by committees of the House of Representatives, which were ruled by those who had seniority, and the seniority people in the House of Representatives were Congressmen from the South. I remember the key figure was a Congressman from South Carolina named McMillan. We all called him &quot;Judge McMillan.&quot; He really was. He was judge and everything else. It was a fascinating thing. He stayed in office in part by being able to report to his constituency in South Carolina that things were terrible in Washington because of the predominantly black population when, in fact, he was in charge. He was the effective one who accomplished whatever was done administratively in Washington, so he had a perfect cyclical system of security. He could see that things were bad in Washington and then would go down to South Carolina and report that they were bad. In other words, I really came to terms with the whole matter of structural racism on the streets of Washington, D.C. and became influenced by black citizens with whom I worked on a number of different councils and committees. Most notable was a man with whom my church, the Church of the Pilgrims, established a community relationship with the Church of the Redeemer, a predominantly black church. Both of these were Southern Presbyterian churches in the District of Columbia, and the man who was called as their pastor was a man named Jefferson Rogers. Jeff Rogers and I were about the same age, and his wife and my wife both grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, and it was one of those fascinating things where we sat down and we began to develop a relationship of complete candor. It took a little while to get absolutely honest with each other, but we began that kind of frank exchange of where we&#x27;d come from and what we saw as the situation. For instance, Mary Grace Rogers and Arline, as we sat at their table one night, discovered that they were both from Shreveport, and we talked about what that meant and so forth. It was perfectly amazing. Here were these two women about the same age, both interested in the same thing, both active in educational work, both active in the social life of the city, both active in the church and in youth conferences and all that sort of thing. When they sat down and talked together, all they really had in common was the weather. In other words, it was that distinct. There was a black community; there was a white community. And we wept over that. We began to realize the tragedy of that. I remember such helpful moments as when Jeff was talking about the predicament that blacks faced in terms of the structural racism. I remember saying to him, &quot;Well, all I feel as a result of that is just pure guilt.&quot; And he said, &quot;Guilt is not an adequate response. The trouble with guilt is that it paralyzes.&quot; That has stuck in my mind, and I think in some ways in part has been one of those moments of breakthrough for me, where I felt, &quot;If you can do something about this, you really must do something about it.&quot; As a result of that friendship with him, which continues, we helped to form together the Washington chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Washington for the chartering of that chapter, and I met him and was with him on that occasion. I was with him on one or two other occasions that involved primarily meetings related to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Since by then, you see, I was a white southerner who was involved in what basically was a predominantly black civil rights movement I at least had the contacts which such a group needed to be able to establish relationships across town and throughout the South. When we moved to Atlanta to Central Presbyterian Church, one of the tangential things… It wasn&#x27;t central to the whole decision, because we went as a call to Central Presbyterian Church, a splendid church thoroughly involved in the life of the city of Atlanta. But one of the serendipitous effects was the fact that Ebeneezer Baptist Church, of which Dr. King and his father were co-pastors, was about a quarter of a mile from Central Church, and so we contacted them and they were very hospitable to us. As we arrived in Atlanta, the Kings greeted us, and in retrospect that was very significant. That opened doors that we just simply would never have had opened to us, particularly in the black community but also somewhat in the white community. I moved to Atlanta in December of 1967, and Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis in April of 1968, just really four months later. The result was that what I think would have come to have been a very close association was aborted. Since Mrs. King had been so gracious when we came, Arlene and I went immediately over to her house and visited with her and with Daddy King and with Mrs. King, Sr., and that began a very close friendship, so that I have stayed in touch with the King family. I shared in Mama King&#x27;s funeral. I went back to Atlanta to share in Daddy King&#x27;s memorial service just this past year. And the two churches began to program together, a predominantly black church and a predominantly white church, and now do a great many things jointly. That relationship continues, and it&#x27;s a very exciting one. Through the process of all that, I got to know the other civil rights leaders in Atlanta and was heavily involved with Andy Young. Andy was Chairman of the Community Relations Commission of the city of Atlanta, and I was his Vice-Chair. Then when he was elected to Congress, I became Chair of the Community Relations Commission, and Joe Lowry, who&#x27;s now President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, became my Vice-Chair. Then when I came to Charlotte, he took over the Chairmanship of the CRC there. The result of this is that I&#x27;ve always been really involved in interracial discussions about the issues that affect the community and the society and have come a long time ago to see that it&#x27;s very important that we talk together, that you cannot deal with any of these issues from a one-race point of view. I think that&#x27;s the trap most people don&#x27;t realize. They figure, &quot;Well, we can figure out this problem, and we can solve it.&quot; But the &quot;we&quot; has got to include blacks as well as whites, and that&#x27;s true for the black community as well as the white community. Each community can fool itself that it can do this alone, but it can&#x27;t. Together we can really move in terms of the structures and systems of a metropolitan area like Charlotte, or a state like North Carolina, or this region, or the nation, but it&#x27;s got to be both black and white, and that&#x27;s, I guess, maybe the chief learning from all that pilgrimage.  BRUCE KALK: How much involvement was there in the Southern Chrisiian Leadership Conference by Southern whites such as yourself?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: At the beginning, there was not very much. Well, there was some, a little sprinkling of it, but as the civil rights movement came of age… I would say it really came to maturity in 1963 with the March on Washington. That was a key and pivotal year for me. By then I was a member of SCLC; I was a member of the Host Committee in Washington for the March on Washington; I had convinced the session and congregation of the Church of the Pilgrims, who were basically mostly southern white people, that we should be involved in hosting this gathering and let our church be used as a place where Congressional delegations could meet the constituents from their states. And then, just at that point, our denominational leaders in the old Presbyterian Church here—that&#x27;s the old Southern Church—made a declaration that they would not participate in the March on Washington. Now there were a good many churches that didn&#x27;t participate, but the Southern Baptist Church and the Southern Presbyterian Church were the two that said specifically, &quot;We will not participate.&quot; I was at that moment left hanging on a limb. I was a local pastor of a congregation, and my session had said, &quot;We will participate,&quot; and the denominational leadership said that they will not. I wrote an open letter just before the March on Washington to the leaders of our denomination, basically saying, &quot;We will miss you.&quot; Out of that began a movement within the Southern Presbyterian Church called A Fellowship of Concern, and it was an informal gathering of largely whites, though it was never segregated, and there were always blacks in some number. But it was predominantly white by a great margin, and its concern was involvement in the civil rights struggle, plus the giving of assistance to those who came into difficulty because of their work in civil rights. It was a signficant movement. The organization lasted for about five or six years and included a great many North Carolinians. It was strong in Virginia and North Carolina and in Georgia and in Tennessee and in Arkansas and in Texas and had active members in all the southern states. A Fellowship of Concern became very involved in the march from Selma to Montgomery. A Fellowship of Concern was involved in presenting a petition to the Senate at a moment in about 1964 or &#x27;5 when the Senate was locked up in filibuster from the southern senators, and we carried a petition signed by over 1,000 southerners indicating that the voice of filibuster is not the authentic voice of the South. It was one of those symbolic things. I remember Senator Russell was leading the filibuster, and his nephew, who was a good friend of mine, was one of the signers of the petition. Russell said at the time the reason that bill—I think it was the Voting Rights bill—passed was that the damn preachers decided it was a religious issue. I don&#x27;t know if he was right. The reason a bill passes is that the conscience of the community coalesces around what it symbolizes, and there were a lot of factors, but certainly that was one. I guess that&#x27;s to say that there were southern whites who became thoroughly involved in the civil rights struggle. I&#x27;ve given you one strain that&#x27;s kind of predominantly Presbyterian, but there were similar movements in other areas. There are good examples of people like Will Campbell, who was a Southern Baptist who basically was a campus minister at the University of Mississippi for some years, a key white figure in a number of those civil rights confrontations. I wish I could name a whole lot, but it was a thin but though community of folk.  BRUCE KALK: Let me ask you about the related issue of the desegregation of church-related colleges and other institutions. How did that go about for the Presbyterian Church in the United States?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: It came very slowly, and I wish I could say that the Presbyterian Church led in that. We did not; we followed. The whole matter of desegregation of education has been a primary issue in my adult life. I graduated from Union Seminary in Richmond, Virginia, in May of 1954, and my class probably thought that that was the greatest event of that month or probably that year. But we were wrong. The fact is, the most significant event in this country in May of 1954 was Brown v. Board of Education, and what basically was happening, we youthful southern Presbyterian preacher-types were heading out to the parishes of the Southeast, largely, to walk into a major firestorm. Most of my generation&#x27;s ministry has been forced to grapple with this thing. It was not until the public education structures became convincingly open to blacks that private structures conformed. There is an exception. The Presbyterian institutions and, I think, other institutions, too—I&#x27;m confident in terms of one or two Methodist institutions I know—did move rather quickly to open up to blacks and other racial ethnic representatives from overseas. It was kind of interesting. [Laughter] If you were not an American, it was to your advantage at that  point if you were black. It was one of those interesting moments of transition where Africans and others, Latin Americans and Asians, began to really open the doors, and then there came with that an inrushing of black students that I wish were larger than it is now, but at least it&#x27;s fairly typical of religiously oriented colleges, seminaries, and secondary schools of the mainline churches that they are thoroughly open. In other words, the thing you find, say, in a Bob Jones, where there is a desire not to have contact between the races, is an exceptional thing within the religious institutions of this country. That&#x27;s not the norm.  BRUCE KALK: One further related question here is, I think, in many respects a continuing issue. That&#x27;s the desegregation of congregations themselves, which is probably the slowest to come about. Could you comment on any progress towards that?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Yes, there is some progress toward that, but I would say also that we need to understand exactly what that represents. Religion is very close to identity. What we believe is very close to who we are. Therefore, when you&#x27;re dealing in the matter of religious identification with a congregation or a denominational tradition, you&#x27;re dealing with the close personal issues of identity and commitment, with the result that rather instinctively and naturally, this is not something that you come into and walk away from after five p.m. like a job, or that you can come into and sit in rows of chairs and so forth. This has to do with who you are, so that it tends to be a very personal decision that is not immediately affected by structural change. The second thing to be observed is, that&#x27;s true for blacks as well as whites, so that what that means is, all during the post-slavery period—and, in fact, during slavery to some extent, but certainly the post-slavery period—and during the period of segregation, the black church was not only a place of personal identification, as it is for whites, but it was the only institution that really was theirs. It was something that they could say, &quot;This is ours, and the man can&#x27;t control this one,&quot; so that the black church is a very important institution in every southern community, in fact in every community.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Therefore, we&#x27;re not going to find large numbers of blacks leaving a black institution that&#x27;s been that important to their own personal identity and to their own corporate liberation. We&#x27;re not going to find them moving into predominantly white congregations in great numbers and should not expect to. What is happening, there are two things. Some are coming. For instance, this congregation has 2,800 members. There are probably fifteen racial ethnic folks, including Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, and oh, about five black Americans, which is infinitesimal in a way. But nonetheless, this is very important, and the congregation has been right savvy about seeing that they get in places of influence so that their voice is heard, so we&#x27;re not just talking to white middle and upper-middle-class folks when we&#x27;re talking about the mission of the church. The other thing that is happening—and I think this is much more productive—is the linking up of churches, a predominantly black church and a predominantly white church programming together, worshipping together, doing the kinds of ministries that are possible in a city like this together. That, I think, is the most productive direction in the future.  BRUCE KALK: What sorts of opposition did you experience within the Southern Presbyterian denomination over this racial issue?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Well, you know, in retrospect, I&#x27;ve been really very blessed by the fact that I was of the South and that my roots are in the South and that I lived in the South. Let me say that what that meant is that I could never go off somewhere and demonstrate my zeal for interracial relationships and then go back home and assume that I had done my thing. That&#x27;s too easy a way out that affected the whole civil rights movement. It was too easy a movement. The fact is, in the South, when we marched we had to march on the courthouse that probably had some of our elders and deacons as its officials. We had to demonstrate against business establishments that were owned and operated by members of our congregations. Therefore, you had always to stay in touch with people with whom you disagreed, and in retrospect, that was a very salutary thing. That meant that there was no sort of quick fix. You had to very carefully work at what you did, and then you had to go and be sure relationships were still intact with those with whom you had been in opposition. Now that&#x27;s hard to do, but that&#x27;s what pastoral care is. It&#x27;s like surgery a little bit. You need the surgeon to come in and lance the boil, but then somebody&#x27;s got to change the dressing and see that the healing is done and so forth. And that&#x27;s part of what was involved for those of us who were southern whites, is to not just lance the boil but to see to the healing that&#x27;s involved. It&#x27;s painful, but it&#x27;s a very important discipline. And let me give an example from a different area. I found it very helpful to be pastor in Washington, D.C. during the early years of the protests against Vietnam, for the reason that I had on my session and diaconate and in our congregation a large number of people who worked at the Pentagon. In other words, the military establishment is pretty powerful in Washington, and here we were talking about that we have made a mistake in committing ourselves militarily in southeast Asia. Well, once again, you couldn&#x27;t just paint a sign and say, &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s a mistake.&quot; You had to make that witness, but then you had to sit down with the very people whose job it was to implement the policy of military involvement in southeast Asia and try to think through, &quot;How do we hold together in the life of faith and the community of faith? We disagree on this, but here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from. Where are you coming from?&quot; That sort of thing. And I&#x27;ve always been grateful that I&#x27;ve never been able to be quick and easy and superficial about social issues. I&#x27;ve always had to sit down with people who disagreed with me and keep a relationship. I think that&#x27;s an important reality in the southern church, that the change has come; it&#x27;s been painful, it&#x27;s been slow, but it&#x27;s very authentic. You get a white southerner who&#x27;s really dealt with his instinctive racism, and he or she has already dealt with racial feelings that the rest of the country doesn&#x27;t even know it has.  BRUCE KALK: How has your political liberalism shaped your status within the denomination? Did you feel or experience any isolation during the sixties by fellow clergymen?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Yes and no. I did feel some, yeah. There were some lonely years. But on the other hand, there was a growing realization on the part of people of conscience that change had to come, and, while they might not have been approving of this method or that, there was a general feeling of a need for change. The Fellowship of Concern that I mentioned to you before was probably influential here, in that it quickly became a kind of support group, so one was not isolated but had colleagues who came from the same tradition. The other thing to be said about that is that I am really from the South, as I&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;ve indicated that one of my ancestors was the first President of Davidson. Another ancestor was Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s chaplain. I had family that fought all through the Civil War, a great-great-grandfather who was a moderator of the old Southern Presbyterian Church many years ago. In other words, I had impeccable Southern credentials [laughter], and that helps. My father&#x27;s position in terms of  World Missions gave me a breadth of introduction that I shall always be grateful for, and I would oftentimes talk to Dad about that, that &quot;I hope I&#x27;m not just using your influence,&quot; and he was delighted. He said, &quot;What you&#x27;re doing is directly related to what went on in World Missions.&quot; And then one more thing. You have to remember where I began, in terms of seminary and Scotland and A.M. Hunter and James Denney and all that. With all that civil rights involvement, I&#x27;m still basically a Biblical theologian. I&#x27;m still a teaching and preaching pastor, and I have seldom tried to preach any political solutions from the pulpit. My feeling about the pastoral responsibility is that in the pulpit and in the worship service, you help people to grapple with Moses and Amos and Jeremiah and Jesus, and you help them to see what the Word means for them and for their life and for their systems and their jobs and their structures. And then during the week, you try to demonstrate that in where you put yourself and your time. But I&#x27;ve tried to keep a right careful distinction there, so that in retrospect, I think that probably is how I have been able to continue as a minister in the Southern Presbyterian Church through all of that hurricane and, I hope, be helpful.  BRUCE KALK: What key social issues are foremost now on the church&#x27;s agenda? What social issues do you feel the church should be addressing right now?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I think the great issue before us right now is the whole matter of peace. Of all the issues we have, the implications of this one are so horrendous, in that we do clearly have the capacity to simply eliminate life on the planet. This means that this is not an elective; this is a mandatory moral issue, and we&#x27;ve got to find effective ways of reconciling the present hostility that&#x27;s being exacerbated between the major powers. There are some things that flow from that. One is that peace grows in the soil of justice a whole lot more than it does in the soil of order, which is something that neither Washington nor Moscow seems to understand. That is to say, it is when you provide just structures and systems and affirm human life and human rights that you have the possibility of peaceful change, peaceful revolutions and so forth. If you insist on order only as a way to peace, you&#x27;re going to make violent revolution inevitable, and therefore I think one of the consequent moral issues before us is this whole matter of justice and human rights, not only in this country but in this hemisphere and around the world. There are other issues that flow out of that, too. Hunger is a very basic moral issue, I think. There are people starving in a world in which there&#x27;s plenty of food. That means that our systems of production and delivery and the economic implications of where we place our priorities are suspect. That&#x27;s a genuine moral issue. The environment, the whole matter of a sensitivity to soft energy patterns, is a very important issue for us, because those are the kinds of things that precipitate despair and death and thus violent response and reaction, the sorts of things that build for terrorism and ultimately for annihilation. There are plenty of other issues that come at other matters before us. I think the whole matter of feminist concerns, the rights of women, is a basic revolution. I frankly think it&#x27;s a more basic revolution than the racial revolution, because it affects every single home, and I think my five daughters have sensitized me in this area as much as anything else. I am delighted to find the doors that are open to them, and it just simply makes me realize they need to be more widely opened, and that&#x27;s an unfinished battle. The whole issue of poverty in this country is very serious, and we&#x27;re not working at it very well at all, I think. This whole business of hands off. Well, I could say a whole lot about the present administration&#x27;s role, but I think it&#x27;s mistaken, and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to have to get worse before the country sees that this is just simply… This is benign indifference that&#x27;s causing people to suffer in ways that are simply not justifiable in the wealthiest country, probably, in the whole history of the world. There are a number of others, but that&#x27;s enough catalog of issues. The thing about human life is that there are always such issues. You don&#x27;t really solve these issues. The human predicament is such that you resolve an expression of the problem, and then you deal with the consequences that flow out of that resolution.  BRUCE KALK: What specific moves can the church in general and the Presbyterian Church in particular take to address this social agenda?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I think the church ought to begin to take very seriously the fact that it needs to be in the business of peacemaking. And this is strange. For instance, the Presbyterian Church has never been known as a peace-loving church. I expect we probably historically have been the second most militaristic church in America. I expect the most militaristic church has probably been the Roman Catholic Church. We didn&#x27;t bless the bombs and the guns the same way their priests and bishops did, but we carried them, all the way from the Revolutionary War forward. But there&#x27;s something happening. It&#x27;s subtle, it&#x27;s quiet, but it&#x27;s substantial. Catholics, Presbyterians, other mainline folks are beginning to take quite seriously the fact that peacemaking is a part of what we are about. We used to leave that to the Mennonites and the Quakers and the Brethren and so forth and be thankful somebody was doing it, you know, but we&#x27;re suddenly coming to terms with the fact that &quot;Wait a minute. The man in whom we believe was known as the Prince of Peace, and Jesus said Himself, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.’ &quot; And we haven&#x27;t been doing much peacemaking. I think it&#x27;s not just a matter of fear of nuclear annihilation, although, God knows, that&#x27;s enough to fear. It&#x27;s also a matter of faith, a matter of awareness that this is part of our faith that we&#x27;ve been silent to and blind to. But peacemaking is a very basic and revolutionary thing. If I&#x27;m to be a peacemaker, I&#x27;ve got to be a peacemaker in my own home. For instance, I don&#x27;t get angry or moody with the Russians. I may not like the communist systems, but the persons who are likely to receive the animus of my real hostility are the members of my family. Peacemaking is just pervasive. We&#x27;ve got to be peacemakers in the community; we&#x27;ve got to be peacemakers in the state, in the region, in the nation, in the hemisphere, in the world. It involves a revolutionary change of priorities and of life. And it&#x27;s happening, very slowly. Here in this Myers Park Presbyterian Church, a very establishment-oriented, predominantly white church here in Charlotte, we have a very active Peacemaking Council working. Tomorrow we go off on retreat with some fifty members of the congregation with a theologian from St. Louis, Missouri, on the whole matter of how you effectively mold your life toward peacemaking. That&#x27;s significant. That&#x27;s going to bear some fruit, because that&#x27;s a new phenomenon.  BRUCE KALK: Let me turn to the question of theology and ask you if you could explain the cornerstones of your personal theological convictions.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Yes. This coming Sunday I&#x27;m preaching a third sermon of three saying goodbye to my congregation, and I&#x27;ve chosen to preach from the Apostolic Benediction in Second Corinthians, where the letter is concluded, &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&quot; And that sums up very succinctly the cornerstones of my faith. My faith begins with this man who lived 2,000 years ago and who was a man for others and whose life demonstrated a grace, demonstrated an outwardness toward others that informs the whole of our existence. And the church, thus, has got to be a church for others, not because we think that&#x27;s a good idea but because we follow a man who lived his life and died for others. The second founding stone is that second phrase, &quot;the love of God.&quot; Last Sunday I was sharing my ideas about that and shared with them my feeling that this is a very important understanding, because the truth is that we live largely in a time of practical secularism, that if God exists, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. It doesn&#x27;t affect the way we go about our life and so forth. What I think faith says to that is summarized in part by the little girl in Sunday school who was asked about who was Jesus. Her reply was, &quot;Jesus is the best picture God ever had took.&quot; Now that&#x27;s where my faith goes. In other words, I look at this man Jesus, and I sense that what he was constantly doing, he was never pointing at himself; he was always pointing beyond himself, pointing at a power beyond. So that I think a foundation stone has to do with the understanding that God is, and God cares, &quot;the love of God.&quot; This coming Sunday I&#x27;m going to conclude with &quot;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,&quot; which basically is that God is alive and at work and that our task in the church is to be open to which way is He leading in the world, where is He going, and follow, even at the cost of a cross. &quot;The fellowship of the Holy Spirit&quot; is a very empowering kind of thing for a Christian community, which Presbyterians are a little hesitant to deal with, because you can&#x27;t quite control that sort of thing. We like things done decently and in order, but I think it&#x27;s a very important reality that faith has to be lived out in the present tense, and that&#x27;s what the whole business of the Holy Spirit is. So in a nutshell, you see, I&#x27;m pretty orthodox. I mean, that&#x27;s Trinitarian faith, is what that is. It comes at it a little differently, but that&#x27;s what I believe.  BRUCE KALK: What would you say your connection is to a view of scriptural perspectives on human nature and the other-worldliness of redemption?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: The view of scripture I have is that it is… Well, Luther said it well. &quot;Scripture is the cradle in which Christ lies.&quot; The reason scripture is important is in part because there we see the story of how God has called into being a people in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, and you don&#x27;t find that anywhere else. I don&#x27;t worry about scripture, and I don&#x27;t worry about such things as the inerrancy of scripture and all that sort of thing, for the reason that the scripture is exactly what the church has historically said it is, and that is, it&#x27;s an unfailing guide in faith and life, because there you find the story of Israel and of Jesus and of the church. People who worry about attacks on the scripture or try to defend it and argue for its inerrancy and all that sort of thing remind me of frogmen who are worried about the hull of an old ship, lest it have a leak in it or something, when all the time, on the bridge of the ship, our Lord is saying basically, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. Be not afraid, men of little faith. It will not sink. I am in the ship.&quot; The scripture power is a power because of the story it tells. It&#x27;s the Word that&#x27;s within the words that is the power. I think one of the problems I see in emerging militant fundamentalism is this whole matter of Biblical inerrancy. That will simply not hold water. That is not the way to go at scripture. Your question was longer than that. Where did you go from Biblical…  BRUCE KALK: I was also interested in how your view of scripture had an impact on a scriptural perspective on human nature and the other-worldliness of redemption.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: The Bible makes very clear that it&#x27;s got no hangups about the fact that man or humankind is perfected at all. It&#x27;s a very clear understanding that the human dilemma is very serious. The predicament of human nature is clearly delineated in the scripture. And of all the doctrines that the church holds, the one doctrine that is absolutely provable and demonstrated every day is the doctrine of original sin, that is, that down in the roots of our being, even when we try to do something real good, we mess it up because of who we are. I believe clearly the Biblical understanding of the predicament of human nature, and I think the whole matter of redemption from that is the work of the Gospel. In other words, it&#x27;s grace. We live, then, not by what we are able to accomplish; we live by accepting the free gift which God gives of life itself and of meaning to life which comes, from my perspective, out of reorienting ourselves away from ourselves into a purpose that&#x27;s higher than ours and that basically comes from beyond us, which is what it means to believe in the Gospel.  BRUCE KALK: Let me turn now to ask you if you could discuss the reunification of the Northern and Southern Presbyterian Churches and your role in that reunification.  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: All my life, I&#x27;ve wanted our church to be reconciled. It never has made sense to me that we were a regional church, but when it really came home to me was when I went to Washington as a young pastor. Here I was in the nation&#x27;s capital, trying to help my people to a national and international view of the issues of life, and we basically thought in terms of the sixteen southern states, which were our General Assembly. And so I made a decision as a young man, &quot;If I ever get a chance to do something about that, I&#x27;m going to hit that,&quot; and I got that chance, providentially. When I was in Atlanta as pastor of Central Church, I was asked to be the Chair of the southern portion of the Joint Committee on Presbyterian Reunion. Along with a colleague, Bob Lamar of First Church, Albany, New York, he and I were the Co-Chairs of that committee for fourteen years.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: That was a fascinating experience. When I took that responsibility, I thought it would probably be right easy to do, because we were all part of the same family, same name, same basic faith, same understanding of ministry and so forth. But I learned a lot in that. One is, it&#x27;s a lot harder to bring a family back together that&#x27;s divided than it is to introduce total strangers to each other and help them become good friends. So it took almost a decade and a half, and it involved working through regionalism and fears and pride and some distinctions in terms of faith. It also involved, here in North Carolina particularly, a racial distinction, so it wasn&#x27;t far removed from my other concern in that the United Presbyterian, or the so-called Northern Presbyterian, presence here was largely black, represented in such institutions as Johnson C. Smith here in Charlotte, Barber-Scotia up in Concord, etcetera. And the Presbyterian-U.S., the so-called Southern Church, was largely white and very strong in this state because of all the Scotch-Irish settlements that began much of North Carolina. So it was a matter of racial reconciliation as well as working out the ecclesiastical structures. In the process, what we really decided to do is seek to draw up the outlines that would be involved in a new kind of church, and ultimately, rather than just putting two institutions together, we sought to draw up those lines along which a new Presbyterianism could emerge in this country. I probably won&#x27;t live long enough to see whether we were successful in that, but we&#x27;re well begun, at least. We&#x27;ve redefined the church in this whole process in terms of mission and unity, the sort of things we are talking about, as being authentic parts of its ministry, and therefore its structure flows out of that. That&#x27;s different for Presbyterians, because we&#x27;ve tended to define ourselves structurally, as most denominations do. And so we&#x27;ve taken a new look at Presbyterianism, and it&#x27;s been fascinating to be part of that process. I want to just add one more thing. I think in some ways I had discovered in the process of that a spiritual truth. I&#x27;m a more spiritual person for having spent those fourteen years. I mean by that, inevitably in those sorts of things, you have to work through ecclesiastical politics and all that, and you get groups together to influence other groups and so forth, and I know how to do all that. But I discovered something in this thing, and that is that there were some conversions that took place on the way to reunion that I can&#x27;t explain. And there were some people that changed their mind who had nothing to gain by changing their mind, and maybe something to lose. So that I walked away from this reunion pilgrimage with a feeling, &quot;You know, the Lord of the church is interested in the unity of His church.&quot; And if you really try to be faithful to the spirit of God, there is power there, there is strength there. The reunion did not just represent the coming together of North and South, though it did that. It also represented the coming together of right and left; conservative evangelicals joined with ecumenical social activists to say, &quot;We&#x27;re all needed in this new church.&quot; And I&#x27;m grateful for that. I think it was a salutary healing of a divided family in many ways and very worthwhile, in retrospect one of the most satisfying things I&#x27;ve ever done.  BRUCE KALK: What do you consider to have been the greatest substantive differences between the two denominations that you had to surpass in order for them to be reunited?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: The attitudinal change was the biggest thing. It wasn&#x27;t substantive; it was a matter of approach. Basically pride on each part and fear of losing something from the reunion. The substantive issues were significant, though, and one was this whole matter of interracial inclusiveness. How do you put together the church in such a way that these small black congregations, say here in North Carolina, are not just simply swallowed up by the much larger predominantly white units? That&#x27;s significant, and so we worked with a number of different efforts to try to resolve that in such a way that the authentic black experience is not just lost and absorbed. Another issue was the whole matter of the empowerment of women. The two churches were not at the same place on that, and how do you give assurance that there will be women as well as men on sessions and diaconates? How do you give assurance that there will be women in all levels of the church&#x27;s life and so forth? And how do you relate that to congregations who&#x27;ve never had women on their sessions and so forth? So it&#x27;s a matter of working through that process. Another issue that was quite substantial was, what&#x27;s to be the confessional base of this church? Presbyterians are a faith-oriented people, and we like to articulate our faith. We like to write it out again and say it again. How are we going to do that? There were other issues that were less significant than those. One has to do with the whole style of church organization. The United Presbyterian Church, the so-called Northern Church, tended to work—this is an overstatement—from the top down. That is, General Assembly actions would filter down through synods or regional units down to presbyteries or local metropolitan units and then down to sessions and congregations. In the PC-U.S., the Southern Church, we tend to work from the bottom up. Neither of those is better than the other. Neither of those is righteous and the other wrong. They just are, and they come out of our sociological development. They come out of our history. The old Southern Church is an old church; it&#x27;s been here from colonial times in a region of the country where there has not been major in-migration of population until the Second World War. So what you had were generations and generations of Presbyterians growing up knowing each other, kin to each other across state lines, family patterns being very significant and so forth. When General Assembly got together, you didn&#x27;t pass mandatory language. You didn&#x27;t come to the family reunion to say everybody&#x27;s got to do something. What you did was, you jawboned and you negotiated and you compromised and you argued and you pointed out how Cousin So-and-so was doing this in the next county. Then finally you said, &quot;All right now, let&#x27;s everybody take two steps&quot; in whatever direction it is that you&#x27;ve agreed to do. In the old UP Church, they were too big for that and too complex. It had been founded during waves of migration as we moved all the way from the East Coast to the West Coast. The Presbyterian Church in the Midwest is very different from the Presbyterian Church in the Northeast and vastly different from the church in the Southwest and Southern California and so forth. How are you going to get continuity there? Well, what you do is, you put out mandatory language. You say, &quot;Everybody, let&#x27;s take two steps to the left or right or whichever.&quot; And by and large everybody does it, but they don&#x27;t like it. And the reason they don&#x27;t like it is that nobody twisted their arm; nobody did all that homework that was part of the PC-U.S. So part of this was working through stylistic changes and fashioning a church where neither of those styles would be lost, because there&#x27;s benefit in both, letting the national church stretch the local church, but also letting the local church make authentic, and give integrity to, what it is the national church wants to do. In addition, there were questions about where the headquarters would be, what about church property? Those sorts of things were minor but influential.  BRUCE KALK: What theological or doctrinal differences had to be surpassed for the two churches to come together?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: I&#x27;d say basically none. There are some who would say there have been doctrinal differences, and historically there have been some historical differences. But what we found very quickly in our quest for reunion—we spent the first two years just interviewing people all over the whole country and discovering the diversity in both streams—was that there was more diversity within each of our churches than there was between us. The difference wasn&#x27;t between us; the difference was within each of us. We had folks who were rigid inerrantists, fundamentalists; we also had people who were basically, well, across the whole spectrum, to a position not far removed from a Christ-conscious unitarianism. That diversity was in each stream, and so it was a question then of how do you reflect that diversity? There was a confessional difference in that the United Presbyterian Church had taken up a multi-confessional base in 1967, and the PC-U.S. Church had refused to do that and had held to a document from the seventeenth century called the Westminster Confession of Faith and its attendant documents. We were able to move through that, primarily in helping the new church to see what we need is a new statement of faith for our own day; rather than just inherit from the past, we need to take that tradition and articulate it for our own time. So there is a committee now at work on a brief statement of the reformed faith that will be before us for the next several years, and it&#x27;s good for Presbyterians to start their pilgrimage together looking at what they believe.  BRUCE KALK: What about the issue of, say, a public versus a private morality? I&#x27;m thinking in particular of the PC-U.S. Church, which was born in an attempt to separate the morality of the private sphere, the church per se, from the public morality of social issues of the day, and that church attempting to keep a distinction finely drawn between these two realms. How was this surpassed in a reunionification with the more socially active United Presbyterian Church?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: That&#x27;s a very perceptive question. It&#x27;s quite true that the PC-U.S. Church was born out of schism, out of a division in the nation itself, and the decision was to move out with the national division. It&#x27;s too simplistic to say that slavery was the issue that separated the church, because, in fact, slavery did not separate the Presbyterian Church. It did divide the Baptists and the Methodists, but the Presbyterians held together until the nation itself split. Then the Southern Presbyterians gathered in Augusta, Georgia, in 1861 and formed the Presbyterian Church-Confederate States of America, arguing that there was a separate nation, and the typical structure for Presbyterians is along national lines. And so we formed this Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States. It lasted four years. Then we were one nation again. It&#x27;s interesting that the issues that were so compelling in &#x27;61 that we needed to use national boundaries did not strike the fathers of the church as quite as compelling in &#x27;65 and &#x27;66 when they came back together and we were part of one nation and would normally have said, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll be a part of this national body again.&quot; Because by then two things had happened. One is regional hostility. The War broke families up and turned brother against brother and so forth. But the other is the very point you&#x27;re making, that the Southern Christian Church was faced with the issue of how do you deal with schism and slavery? The issue they were struggling with is how do you keep men and women as slaves and keep Jesus Christ as Lord at the same time? And the only way you can do that intellectually is to divide the world up. There are personal and private matters, and there are social and political and economic matters, and religion falls in the private sector, and economics, involving slavery, falls in the public sector. It&#x27;s affected the Southern Baptist Church; it&#x27;s affected the old Southern Methodist Church; it&#x27;s affected our Southern Presbyterian Church. All mainline denominations in the South struggled with the same thing, and they developed a spirituality-of-the-church understanding. That is, the church ought to limit itself to spiritual things. And that has been very strong in the Southeast up until about the Second World War, and I believe in part it was the in-migration of new people who began to settle in the South in the fifties, and then came the civil rights movement, which had a far more pervasive and deeper effect in the South than it did elsewhere. You couldn&#x27;t go off and demonstrate; you had to do it in terms of authentic priorities of your own life. It&#x27;s very interesting, Bruce, that Presbyterian reunion was voted on before, in 1954, and failed. The Brown v. Board of Education decision was in 1954, and the whole movement toward social involvement of the churches as well as other structures of society began. I think one of the reasons reunion passed in &#x27;83, when it had failed in &#x27;54, was not just the passage of time; it was what had happened to the nation and particularly to the South in that period of thirty years, almost, between the two. We cleansed our souls of this heresy of the spirituality of the church, and we began to come clean on the fact that if you&#x27;re going to be a Christian, you&#x27;ve got to be a Christian not only in private life but in public life as well, and it&#x27;s got to affect not only the way you pray but the way you deal with people in your business and the way you deal with the political realities of your time.  BRUCE KALK: The issue of the reunification of the two Presbyterian churches relates very much to the greater ecumenical movement visible in Protestantism today. Could you comment, perhaps, on what directions the ecumenical movement is going in? What do you see as its future?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: The ecumenical movement is healthy and well. Right now we&#x27;re going through an interesting period where the families are finding each other. Presbyterians are a good example. The Lutherans are an equally good example. They&#x27;re coming together and bringing three Lutheran denominations together. The Methodists have already been through this. But we&#x27;re in conversation across these traditional family lines in a variety of different ways. Probably the most far-reaching is the matter of the Consultation on Church Union, so called COCU, which involves ten different denominations. It&#x27;s still a dream, but we&#x27;re talking about covenants of relationships with each other in which we mutually recognize one another&#x27;s membership and ministries, and we begin to share jointly in liturgy and in the sacraments. There&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s happened in the whole matter of ecumenism that is very important, and that is that the Roman Catholic Church is going through a revolution. Ever since Vatican II, there&#x27;s been a new ecumenical spirit in the world. One way of seeing it is, I think, that the Reformation is still continuing. It didn&#x27;t stop in the sixteenth century or the seventeenth century; it continues, and we&#x27;re still in the process of being reformed, all of us, Roman as well as Reformed. That just breaks open everything. I grew up in an age when Roman Catholics and Protestants didn&#x27;t have friendly dealings with each other. I&#x27;m going out to San Francisco to a seminary that&#x27;s one of nine seminaries in a consortium where they share faculty, students, and everything. Six of those seminaries are Protestant, and three are Catholic, and as the church historian, a fine scholar, told me, &quot;It makes a great deal of difference when you [Interruption] &quot; It makes a great deal of difference how they teach the  Protestant Reformation of the fifteenth and sixteenth century when a fourth of your class are Roman Catholics studying for the priesthood.&quot; You see, you can&#x27;t just beat up on the Pope and tell all the good stories about our founding fathers. You have to be absolutely frank about the fact that it was a mixed scene. It was a political and economic as well as a religious phenomenon and came in tandem with the Renaissance and all the rest of that. That&#x27;s a so much healthier way of study. I&#x27;d say right now it&#x27;s hard to predict where we&#x27;re going ecumenically. I have a feeling that it takes a little while for any of these unions to jell. It takes at least a decade to live through the restructuring and all that that&#x27;s involved in one of these things, so I don&#x27;t see any rush, for instance, out of the Presbyterian reunion to move quickly to some new ecumenical venture. But this new Presbyterian Church is thoroughly committed to an unknown ecumenical future and has testified in its new Book of Order that we are willing to be led into whatever structures the Holy Spirit leads us to. That&#x27;s a very non-traditional and open and hopeful kind of prospect.  BRUCE KALK: Could you comment briefly on the resurgence of Protestant evangelicalism in the form of the contemporary born-again movement, particularly its strength in the Presbyterian church?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: It is a phenomenon, and there are reasons for it. One is that we live in a very complex age. Some of the issues we&#x27;ve talked about of peace and justice and so forth are very complicated, almost insoluble problems. Thus, it&#x27;s an era in which it&#x27;s very satisfying to find simple answers, to find concrete answers to complex issues. If you can say, &quot;This is the Word, this is the Way, you must follow this. Follow me, and I will lead you to truth,&quot; you&#x27;re going to get a following in a time when everybody is scared. So part of this is personal reaction to social fear. It&#x27;s more complicated than that, though. I think the mainline churches have probably been inconsiderate of conservative evangelical members for the past several decades. In part, throughout the nineteenth century, there was only a kind of conservative evangelical tradition. It was only with the twentieth century that there emerged a new sense of openness to alternate approaches, a breadth of search for truth, social involvement, activism, and an emphasis on praxis or practice rather than upon theory and theology. The result of that has been that for the past probably three decades, conservative evangelicals have felt marginalized in most of the mainline churches. There is a new sense of militancy on their part, basically saying, &quot;We want a piece of the action. We want some influence in this.&quot; And that&#x27;s what we have been finding in the Presbyterian Church, that partly what happened in union was that we found each other across a divide where we really weren&#x27;t speaking very effectively to each other before. There&#x27;s one other thing, in addition, and that is the whole church growth movement, which is a sociological phenomenon. During these past decades, what&#x27;s also emerged is some of the human sciences have become much more sophisticated. The whole matter of how you communicate with people, how you use the media effectively, all that sort of thing. What makes for growth in a corporate structure of human beings is affecting the church, because what we know now sociologically is that simplistic answers do make for growth; complex questions do not. Churches that are trying to grapple with issues like justice and women&#x27;s rights and world hunger and so forth have got to face a new phenomenon, and that is that that&#x27;s hard to communicate simply over the TV, and it&#x27;s very hard to get people to get in massive groups to attend to. So conservative evangelicals, who are less disposed to deal with those complexities—and that&#x27;s not pejorative; that&#x27;s just historically where their position has been—have taken to the media with a great deal more effectiveness and have taken to larger churches and growing churches with a good bit more effectiveness. Now there&#x27;s a helpful shift taking place. The conservative evangelical community itself is becoming much more socially conscious. There&#x27;s an organization in Washington called Sojourners that&#x27;s headed up by authentic conservative evangelicals. They are on the forefront of this whole peace movement. They are on the forefront of questioning the Administration&#x27;s position on Central America and so forth. It&#x27;s one of those things where there&#x27;s change taking place on both sides of the ideological spectrum, but I think the reasons for the growth that&#x27;s been remarkable on the right is in part what I&#x27;ve just said.  BRUCE KALK: And how significant a part of the Presbyterian Church would you say the evangelical movement constitutes?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: It&#x27;s hard to put numbers there, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very significant. Without knowing what the percentage is, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very significant. This is part of the result of my pilgrimage on reunion: I think it very important. I think it&#x27;s authentic. I want them involved. I think they help correct a shallow activism that is instinctive to those of us who are oriented toward justice issues. We are very quick to find satisfaction in being able to change the structures. We need to be reminded by our brothers and sisters that when you change the structures, you still have not changed the nature of the people who live and implement those structures, and so you&#x27;re still dealing with the old human dilemma and the predicament of human history and the problem of sin. So each needs the other to keep it honest and to make it authentic.  BRUCE KALK: A number of mainline denominations&#x27; theological seminaries have come increasingly under the dominance of conservative evangelicalism. Even the Episcopal Church now has a seminary that is dominated almost entirely by evangelicals. Is that becoming the case in the Presbyterian Church in any sense? Are there any seminaries that are oriented almost exclusively towards the evangelical wing of the church?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: No, it has not happened yet, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely to happen. What, unfortunately, has happened in the Presbyterian Church is primarily that a number of Presbyterian students are going to non-Presbyterian schools. For instance, on the West Coast, where I&#x27;m going, Fuller Theological Seminary down in Pasadena, in the Los Angeles area, is an independent evangelical theological seminary, and it has a large number of Presbyterian students. Our Presbyterian seminary, San Francisco Seminary, has tended to be a very progressive and ecumenical and open and broad-gauged and liberal seminary. There&#x27;s a sense in which these two seminaries have sparred with each other on the West Coast. In part, my going to San Francisco is to try to bridge that gap. When I was Moderator of the church, I spent a day in San Francisco with that seminary, but I spent two days in Pasadena with the Fuller faculty, because I really wanted to know that phenomenon and figure out who those people are. And they&#x27;re good people, and we&#x27;ve got to get beyond just sort of being polarized. But there are independent seminaries, in the Boston area, in the Philadelphia area, elsewhere, that are draining off some of the candidates that come from our more evangelical conservative congregations. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s affecting Presbyterian theological education.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  BRUCE KALK: If you could discuss what you feel is the state of the art now in reformed theology. You&#x27;re going to San Francisco Seminary to serve as its President; you&#x27;ve been Moderator of the reunited Presbyterian Church. What do you feel, with your experiences, is really the state of the art now?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: In terms of local pastoral leadership, or in terms of theological education? In terms of theological education. Well, I&#x27;ll know a whole lot more about the answer to this question a year from now than I know right now. I have never been a president of a theological seminary, and I never thought of myself as that. I&#x27;m a journeyman parson, as John Wesley called himself, and I&#x27;ve always thought of myself as a preaching pastor. But I&#x27;ll tell you what I bring to the conversation when I move into theological education. It is, first of all, a commitment to tough theological and psychological and sociological disciplines. I think we&#x27;ve got to recognize that the seminaries are the seedbed of the ideas of the church, and in some ways are the seedbed for ideas of value in the community. They are charged with the responsibility to think hard about the global issues that are affecting us all. A second thing I believe is that they&#x27;ve got to think in terms of function, and their function is to produce persons who will be the practitioners of ministry in local congregations, as well as others. They&#x27;ll produce teachers and other things, but basically what they&#x27;re in the business of doing is producing preaching pastors, which is partly why I&#x27;m going into it, to see if maybe we can&#x27;t transfer to a new generation an authentic sense of the value of this particular form of ministry, because it&#x27;s very important. Those pastors have got to learn some things. They&#x27;ve got to know how to deal with the Bible; they&#x27;ve got to know how to translate that in terms of modern idiom into the life and thought frames. But they&#x27;ve also got to know how to build community. The church is one of the few institutions in society that&#x27;s really working at community. It&#x27;s not pulling people apart; it&#x27;s trying to bring them together. These pastors are going out to be the builders of community. You can&#x27;t teach that in books; you have to experience community in order to be able to know what it is that you&#x27;re out there trying to build. So that a seminary needs not only to be a stiff academic discipline and a functional kind of preparation for persons who have got a task that&#x27;s quite specific and has demands that are definable, but it&#x27;s also a community that&#x27;s producing the builders of community. And so the relationships in a seminary, in a theological education, are very important, far more important, say, than in a law school, where you&#x27;re preparing adversaries. If you&#x27;re producing community-builders, then you&#x27;ve got to have something that makes community part of their experience. I&#x27;d say another is that it ought to be ecumenical, and I&#x27;m so glad most of our Presbyterian seminaries are tied to some other institution, some other denomination, some other tradition. I&#x27;ve already indicated how important that is in San Francisco. I just think that&#x27;s of the essence. And the other thing I would add is that it ought to have some global orientation; it ought to have some international orientation. Nesbitt says in Megatrends that one of the major trends is to think globally and to act locally. I think that&#x27;s really fundamental to the life of the church. That&#x27;s really what the church ought to be doing. In fact, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all going to be doing, but the church ought to have been out there anyway doing that, because it&#x27;s a global institution, it&#x27;s a global family that&#x27;s got to put all that down on the corner of Main Street and First in a little community of believers. What that means is that you&#x27;ve got to think globally and act locally. I rejoice in the fact, for instance, that in San Francisco we are part of the Pacific Basin of Theological Schools, 140 theological seminaries, which I find hard to believe, but that&#x27;s all up and down the West Coast, Latin America, to the islands of the Pacific and throughout Asia. That&#x27;s very significant. That means there&#x27;s a Third World person teaching on the faculty at all times, and that&#x27;s just great because the world is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. When the world was large, people could afford to be small, get by with it because of the fences. But as the world gets small, people have got to get big.  BRUCE KALK: Lastly, let me ask you what is ahead for you as you leave Charlotte to go to San Francisco to take the presidency of a seminary. What do you think lies ahead for your future?  J. RANDOLPH TAYLOR: Well, I think some homesickness. [Laughter] We&#x27;re going to miss North Carolina, though, as  I&#x27;ve already indicated, we&#x27;ll be back on special occasions, and our family will gather here at Christmastime and in the summers. What I really anticipate, going out there, is that I&#x27;m going to be stretched in new ways. We had just built this house up outside Montreat and were settling into this area, and it&#x27;s been my experience that whenever you start nesting like this, the Lord has a way of coming along and kicking you out of the nest and saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to see if you still know how to fly.&quot; So here we go. I&#x27;m going to find out whether I know how to fly in a different arena. I&#x27;m going to be pushed at several points in terms of new dimensions of the meaning of ministry. The Professor of New Testament out at San Francisco is a very fine woman. She said to me as we were talking with the faculty about this possibility, &quot;I believe, as I&#x27;ve read about your ministry and so forth, you&#x27;ve always been challenged from the right. If you come here, you may find that you&#x27;re challenged from the left.&quot; Well, I think she&#x27;s probably on target, and I look forward to that. I think it would be interesting to see whether I can maintain the best in the tradition, to be the traditionalist in a community, to try to help others to see how valuable that tradition is. That&#x27;s to grow in a new direction. I&#x27;ve always been the one pushing the tradition in other ways. But I believe probably I&#x27;m going to find that I am committed and interested in fewer and fewer things, and I&#x27;m committed and interested in them at a much deeper level. That translates out into trying to put down authentic roots, not only for me individually but also for that institution and for theological education in the reunited church, that will be important. What I hope it will do also is, it will open some doors. What it signals is that it really is a reunited church, that the old barriers are no longer there, that a southerner doesn&#x27;t have to stay in the South; you can minister anywhere God calls you to. So I&#x27;m hopeful that it&#x27;s a signal of hope to the reunited church that the barriers are down, and the ministry we share is to the whole nation.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interview with ARNOLD KIMSEY KING June 10 and 11, 1985 Raleigh, North Carolina By Jay Jenkins Transcribed by Jean Houston Original transcript on deposit at The Southern Historical Collection Louis Round Wilson Library The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina JAY JENKINS: This is Jay Jenkins, interviewing Dr. Arnold K. King in his office in the UNC General Administration Building on June 10, 1985. Dr. King, I think the best way to start would be for you to give us a brief biographical sketch of your personal and professional life. ARNOLD KING: My name is Arnold Kimsey King. I was born in Hendersonville, North Carolina, on December 3, 1901. My ancestors were typical Appalachian Highlanders. They had been in the mountains since about the time of the migration through the mountains following the Revolutionary War. One of my grandfathers was a doctor, and the other was a preacher, and I had a lot of schoolteachers in my background. My father was a typical product of the Reconstruction era, orphaned at a very early age, had to shift for himself, was a veteran of the Spanish American War, came back and picked up his knowledge of landscape gardening, which he had learned working on the Vanderbilt project. During the early part of this century, we lived in Hendersonville, and about 1919 he left Hendersonville and went to western Nebraska, where he owned a good deal of property. Most of my family have lived there since this time, but I have always continued in North Carolina except for visits and a couple of years I spent with them. I graduated from elementary school in 1915. Because we didn&#x27;t have many public high schools in North Carolina at that time, I spent a couple of years at Fruitland Institute taking high school studies, moved over to Mars Hill, which was a ARNODL KING 2 high school at that time, and finished there in 1919. I spent the War years in Fruitland and in Mars Hill. I graduated at about seventeen years of age.  I took the typical long-distance road tour through the West, working in the wheat fields, came back and entered the University of North Carolina in the fall of 1919. We had a great water shortage here that fall, and the University didn&#x27;t open until the first week in October. It was on the quarter system for a good many years after I came here.  I recall very vividly my trip from Hendersonville on the train to Asheville, from Asheville down to somewhere in the neighborhood of Salisbury, and from there to Greensboro, and Greensboro to the University Station. At University Station we got on an old coach and came to Carrboro. I was, of course, a raw lad of seventeen. We had several distinguished professors on there who had been to Europe, among them the late Will Coker, and they were looked upon with awe by all of the students. If you want a good description of that trip from Asheville to Chapel Hill during this period, read in Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s Look Homeward, Angel. Wolfe was on the train with us, and it seems to me that in that book he described the trip that we made down the mountain and to Chapel Hill. Well, we got to Carrboro, and it was about a mile and a half to the campus. There were men hanging around with drays that wanted to deliver our baggage. I gave one of them a check, and we all set out on foot to walk to the campus. We met our baggage in the open space just east of Battle-Vance-Pettigrew, about a hundred yards from the old Silent Sam monument, and many of us didn&#x27;t have rooms because of the influx of World War I veterans, and our first task was to get out and find a room. Well, I walked up and down the street, and I wandered into ARNOLD KING 3 Andrews&#x27; Dry Goods Store. I saw a little bird-faced middle-aged man standing there, and I asked him if he knew anywhere they had a room to rent. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;we have some upstairs.&quot; So, together with three of my friends, we rented a small room on the second floor of the building that still exists on the northeast corner of Franklin and Columbia. At that time, it was three stories. The fire marshal made them take the top story off later. But I remember the Masons met regularly upstairs above us, and they usually created a great commotion.  I was rooming with a man named Hoke Flack, and another, D.A. Wells, and Squirrelly Justice, (we called him) George Justice. George and Hoke have long since gone, but D.A. Wells is a distinguished physicist, retired in EL Paso, Texas.  I visit him occasionally. We had an interesting collection of people on that floor, among them Sam Ervin&#x27;s brother, who was probably the oldest and had been in the Army. We got ourselves registered the next day for the quarter system, and we took a typical freshman load, except I didn&#x27;t know any better. The normal load was three courses, and I told them to give me four. [Laughter] I thought I could do that all right, and over the course of the term I did.  I didn&#x27;t know much about football, because we hadn&#x27;t had a great deal of football in the mountains, but I soon found out that that was the thing that many of them were most interested in, more interested in than they were in their books. We had some young graduate school instructors. That was typical in those days and still is. Among them was the late Bert Linker and the late Henry Totten.  Some of them became distinguished professors later on, but they were sort of indistinguished at that time.  I also had one or two real what we called &quot;face card professors&quot; in those days. One ARNOLD KING 4- of those was Whatley Pierson. Another was former President Francis P. Venable, who was teaching chemistry and was probably the most distinguished and interesting man on the campus. As an aside, I remember one day President Venable entered the classroom waving a little book that was about ten by eight inches and very much excited. He said, &quot;Young men, and you two, young ladies&quot;because we did have two girls in the class~&quot;I want to introduce you to my new book.  It&#x27;s about the most important force on earth, and before you people die it will be the dominant thing in your lives.  The title of this book is Radioactivity.&quot; Well, I was so excited I went out and bought a copy of the book, and, incidentally, I saw it in my attic the other day. It&#x27;s a real simple explanation of radioactivity that would be at about the grammar school level now, but he was certainly right in saying that it was the thing that would dominate our lives before we died.  It would be easy to speculate a lot on your early days. I finally went to a football game, and I saw Carolina beat VMI.  I was struck by the enthusiasm of the crowd, and I was also struck by the presence of a good many Mason jars in the audience. [Laughter] I didn&#x27;t know why they were so interested in canning at that time, but it was not long before I found out. [Laughter] I went home at Christmastime.  I was sort of a famous character in my community, because back in those days there weren&#x27;t many people that went to college, say about one out of seven high school graduates, and less than six percent of the people in my age bracket would be found in college. One who went to college was indeed thought to be ambitious and promising in life.  I had a lot of good friends and good professors. We had men here like Fred Koch, who was putting on dramas for the first ARNOLD KING 5 time. I remember we used to go over to the old high school building. There wasn&#x27;t any auditorium on the campus where he could stage a play. I remember some of them were writing plays. Paul Green was here, Thomas Wolfe.  I believe Thomas Wolfe wrote a play called &quot;The Return of Buck Gavin,&quot; and that was a big hit on the campus. I have forgotten the name of Paul&#x27;s show that year, but it was also a big hit. We had a few women that lived here, but women were not admitted to the University if they had to live outside their own homes. We had rather primitive sanitary facilities. There was one shower bath in the old Bynum Gymnasium, and I think three or four shower heads for two thousand students, and there was a constant trek to Bynum Gymnasium. We didn&#x27;t have much trouble in those days, since there weren&#x27;t supposed to be any women on the campus and bathrooms were expensive and not very popular. We went on into the winter. (I&#x27;m going into this in some detail. I won&#x27;t try to give each year of the last sixty in any such detail.) A tremendous snowstorm occurred sometime in January, 1920, about the time old Harding came out for the presidency. We had a snow fight of unusual intensity around the Old Well. The sophomores were just about to overcome the freshmen when the president of our class, a well known personality in North Carolina life for a good many years, Norman Shepard, who, because of this incident, transferred to Davidson College and later became a well known coach. ... He coached basketball at Harvard, I believe. But Norman had been an officer In the Army, and he&#x27;d been accustomed to protecting his men. When the sophomores jumped on us, Norman went into a nearby dormitory room and appeared on the scene with a snubnosed bulldog pistol, and you&#x27;ve never seen sophomores disappear. They just practically ARNOLD KING 6 evaporated, but, because of that, we lost our president. Incidentally, at that time the late Frank Graham had just returned from the Marines, and   resumed his duties as Dean of Students. Many of the disagreeable tasks of taking care of a rather rowdy bunch of former veterans devolved on him, men like O.B. Harmon and Paul Green and Grady Prichard. There were just numerous men that became well known later on that were veterans, and we had an unusually good football team because many of these men had been toughened on the battle lines. We went on into the spring, and most people don&#x27;t know it but in the year 1920, there was a tremendous wave of inflation that hit this country.  The prices of all commodities, the price of clothing, they just suddenly shot up sky-high.  It was a typical reaction to a period following a war. It just practically devastated the student body. We didn&#x27;t have spending money; we couldn&#x27;t afford the prices. They did keep the prices down in Swain Hall, and we were able to exist. But I remember at about this time, one of those sudden fads hit the campus. We decided that if we couldn&#x27;t lick inflation, we&#x27;d go along with it, so we increased inflation in old bib blue overalls. Some people call them hogwashers today.  They were Blue Bell overalls, and practically every student on the campus bought him a pair of Blue Bell overalls, and we stopped wearing shoes and went barefoot the whole spring of 1920. [Laughter] We got through the year. I recall some of the important events of that year were that Harry Woodburn Chase was inaugurated President. His predecessor had died of flu during the great flu epidemic, and the acting President had also died of flu a few weeks afterwards. Chase had picked it up, and they made him acting President. He acted for about a year, a long, tall, gray-haired, ARNOLD KING 7 young man about   thirty-six, but his hair was so gray everybody thought he was old enough to be trusted. He had this distinguished, patrician, Mayflower-descendant look. I believe he&#x27;s the only Yankee that ever served as President of the University, with the possible exception of Caldwell, the first one. We had a tremendous celebration here to inaugurate him, and he was an immediate hit. He brought in reforms of all kinds that really set the tone for the University from that time on. One of the most fortunate things that ever happened to the University was the selection of Harry Woodburn Chase as President. They would like to have had somebody else, but he did the job so well for a year that they couldn&#x27;t find anybody that they wanted to turn it over to. JJ: Could you give us an illustration of a reform or two that he inaugurated? KING: He reorganized the schools. He brought in distinguished professors. He beefed up the Graduate School. He organized, with the aid of Louis Round Wilson, such things as the library, the Extension Division, the Alumni Association. He simply introduced modern organization and then went out and got professorsj for example, Howard Odum was one of his. And he also had the thesis that if we couldn&#x27;t hire good professors, we&#x27;d raise some of our own. He encouraged young men like Albert Coates and John Couch, men of that kind, to go on with their graduate studies and plan academic careers. As a matter of fact, later on he called me in one day and asked me, &quot;Don&#x27;t you want to go up to the University of Chicago and get a master&#x27;s degree and come back and teach for us?&quot; I told him I was too young to be a college professor. He said, &quot;One thing you can ARNOLD KING 8 do is, you can get old mighty fast when you start graduate study.&quot; So the General Education Board gave me a fellowship, and I went to the University of Chicago and came back. That was the reason. In the summer of 1920, I went out to western Nebraska, and we had real prosperity out there.  In the fall, I came back with some hope of finishing four years. But there then descended on the country in the fall of 1920 and the winter of 1921 a devastating depression that was much sharper than the one that came later, in 1929, but it didn&#x27;t last as long. But it just completely denuded the economy. In my second year, I got a prize room in Old East building, the oldest building on the campus, with a view of the well. You had to be real lucky to get that privilege, in the center of the campus. It also had the advantage of being about 100 yards from Bynum Gymnasium, and you could take a bath a little more often. [Laughter] I had some good professors that year. I had a man named Dargan in English, modern literature.  I had What ley Pierson in history.  I had, as I recall, Eddie Greenlaw, who was the greatest scholar on the campus in English. I had Archibald Henderson in mathematics. All of these were what we called &quot;face cards&quot; in those days, world travellers and men who wrote and were respected.  It was a real pleasure to a young eighteen-year-oldI&#x27;d arrived at eighteen by this timeto have such distinguished professors. I might explain the reason I was a year younger than they are now. We had only an eleven-year school system in North Carolina at that time, and you got into college a year earlier than the young men and women are getting into college now.  It was a very productive year.  I joined ARNOLD KING 9 the literary society. I joined the intramural teams. I joined the debating society.  I started writing for the magazine and all such extracurricular activities, but I did pass my work. I&#x27;m proud to say that I never did flunk a course while I was in the University, and I made only two C&#x27;s. I made one of those C&#x27;s because I refused to take part in a play that they wanted.  I didn&#x27;t have time for it, so they gave me a C instead of a good grade. The other one was a course in French that I&#x27;d already had and was reviewing. I didn&#x27;t do all the written work, and the man threatened to flunk me, and I told him it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference because I&#x27;d already had the course. [Laughter] But he said if I&#x27;d had the course, he&#x27;d condescend to give me a C.  I had some interesting courses, though. I would recommend to any young people today that they take a variety of courses, not to stick to too much specialization.  I think the courses I had that I&#x27;ve derived the most vicarious pleasure from are botany, geology, and chemistry. They&#x27;ve enabled me to understand the world. Now I might explain that I took some of these science courses because my original intent was to go into medicine, but I got into a zoology course where they had a lot of specimens, I&#x27;d say pickled, in formaldehyde, and I never did like the smell of formaldehyde. And I figured if I had to smell that stuff for the rest of my life, it wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I dropped out of becoming a doctor and decided to go into something else. About this time, that depression I mentioned a moment ago caught up with me.  I ran out of money; my folks ran out of money, or their banks ran out of money, I might say. They were living two thousand miles from here, and I didn&#x27;t know how I was going to get there, I was so broke.  So I dropped out at the end of the winter quarter.  I borrowed enough money from a friend of mine to ARNOLD KING 10 buy a railroad ticket to western Nebraska to a little town named Morrill, and I set out. When I got there, I got me a job as a common laborer and earned enough money to send him back the twenty dollars I had borrowed. Then I went to work helping my family rescue the family fortune. That went on for a couple of years, 1921-22, 1922-23, and I&#x27;m happy to say that we succeeded, and I re-entered the University after January 1, 1924. I stayed here until June, 1925, through the summer session of &#x27;24, and I finished the A.B. degree.  I remember in the summer session of 1924, we had a great mock convention for the Democratic nomination.  The only thing I remember about it is we had one fellow that looked exactly like William Jennings Bryan. [Laughter] We held our convention in the old Memorial Hall. That brings up some of the buildings that we had at that time. The edge of the University when I came here was Steele Building and the YMCA. Everything below that and on into Chatham County was woods, deep woods, where the Bell Tower is, where Kenan Stadium is. We had old Caldwell Building, Carr Building, the Bynum Gymnasium, Steele Building, the Haymakers Theater, which was then known as Smith Building, South Building, the YMCA, Gerrard Hall, which was the place that all of us met for chapel. They made freshmen and sophomores go to chapel in those days. The freshmen sat in the orchestra seats, and the sophomores sat in the balcony and threw peanuts at us, and we had a pretty rough time. Then we had old Memorial Hall.  Now they said the architect who planned Memorial Hall took one look at it when it was finished and committed suicide. [Laughter] I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s true or not, but it was an horrendous building, octagonal in ARNOLD KING 11 shape. It had big wooden arches that were built up, and some years later the termites got into the arches and they disintegrated, and they had to wreck it.  That&#x27;s another story. Then we had Phillips Hall, and behind Phillips Hall was what they called the power plant and a big smokestack and a place to purify the water, and then Peabody. Didn&#x27;t have any Carolina Inn, because that was where Louis Graves&#x27; mother lived at that time.  And on the other side we had the old infirmary; we had Swain Hall, which had just been built and was the place that we ate; we had Smith Hall. That was Mary Ann Smith Hall, distinguished from the other Smith Hall. Mary Ann Smith was the daughter of a plantation owner out on Smith Level who gave the money to build that building as a memorial to her. Then we had what was called the Carnegie Library.  It&#x27;s since become Hill Hall, the music hall. And Battle, Vance, and Pettigrew. They were called the new dorms, because they&#x27;d just been completed, and they put running water in them and had water closets, we called them. They were among the first water closets on the campus. Then we had the Alumni Building, and then the four buildings along the road, New East, Old East, Old West and New West and Person Hall (that&#x27;s where the pharmacy building was then). And we had the chemistry building; I believe journalism is in that building now. We had Davie Hall, where  botany and zoology were located, next to the Arboretum, and it&#x27;s since become the psychology building and has been totally bastardized by a sort of modernistic front that is an affront to everybody that drives down    Cameron Avenue through the old campus. How that was ever permitted, nobody knows. Most people think it was one of those anachronisms that occurred after Billy ARNOLD KING 12 Carmichael died and there wasn&#x27;t anybody around to defend the buildings, temporarily. That is a sort of roundup of the campus. By the tiiae I graduated, Harry Chase had reorganized the place. He secured the admission of the University to the Association of American Universities, which was one of the most prestigious learned organizations in America at that time and still is.  How he ever got it in,  I don&#x27;t know, but he made a good pitch, and he had some good people helping him like the late George Howell, who was a first cousin, I believe, to President Woodrow Wilson, [and] the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. He had Eddie Greenlaw, and he had L.R. Wilson, men of that stature that helped him get it in. In the meantime, Frank Graham, who was Dean of Students, had decided that that wasn&#x27;t his dish of tea. Frank was a great cheerleader type, and he was cheerleading for these old veterans that had come back from the Army, and when he got out and made one of his emotional speeches on the Carolina spirit, they were thinking about the spirit that broke the Hindenburg Line, rather than the Carolina spirit, and administration. they didn&#x27;t respond to it too well. He decided that he would give up/ He didn&#x27;t tell me this; I just inferred it. He decided that since he had become sort of unpopular, because of his taking cheerleading ways into the Dean of Students office, that he&#x27;d go into serious academic work. He went back to the History Department as Associate Professor and became a very popular professor. He went off to Columbia University and got a master&#x27;s degree. Then he went to the University of Chicago and was figuring on getting a doctor&#x27;s degree with a dissertation on the influence of electricity on the Industrial Revolution or something like that. I talked to him a lot about it. Then he decided he&#x27;d take ARNOLD KING 13 a year at the London School of Economics, and there he fell under the spell of the late Harold Lasky. Of course, Frank was already very liberal in mind and spirit, but most of his liberalism was really, I think, the result of his deep religious conviction rather than the kind of sociological convictions that motivated other persons, and it explains a good deal of his success in his later career. He was one of the most popular of the professors on the campus, and he had rendered a most remarkable service along about 1923 when we were bulging with students around here and nowhere to put them and no classrooms to teach them in. Frank helped organize the great push that gave us the lower quadrangle of dormitories and also gave us Saunders, Murphey, Manning, and one or two other buildings. That really set off the building boom on the campus.  It was his work and the work of Harry Chase, **                       of L.R. Wilson and people of that sort that brought about this building boom. There were also a few buildings at this time constructed out of funds raised in drives. The Graham Memorial building, dedicated to Edward Kidder Graham, was one such building, the funds for which were slowly trickling in over about five or six years. There was a considerable amount of reconstruction that went on on the campus, too. They renovated Old East and South Building, and it was easy to see that the University was on the move by 1925. However, in that year, the year I graduated, we had one of the famous episodes in the history of North Carolina when the famous Poole bill was introduced to the legislature in Raleigh. It was known popularly as &quot;the monkey bill&quot; and was designed to prevent the teaching of evolution in the schools and colleges of North Carolina. A tremendous battle ensued in which ARNOLD KING 14 President Poteat of Wake Forest University (at that time Wake Forest College) and Harry Chase, the President of the University took the leading opposition role. /Frank Graham entered into it, and most of the liberal-minded college leaders  helped    in preventing the adoption of this bill.  It came perilously close, but we did escape the program that was visited on our neighboring state of Tennessee. We managed to beat down the monkey bill, but that&#x27;s an episode in the history of the University of North Carolina and the state of North Carolina that will not be forgotten by anyone who was present at the time. When I finished, they asked me in the School of Education if I didn&#x27;t want an instruetorship.  I&#x27;d already been awarded a fellowship in the Department of History. The fellowship paid $450, and the instruetorship paid $1,200, so I&#x27;m afraid that Mammon got the [laughter] call over scholarly interests. But they did promise me that I could gradually work into helping with the training of history teachers, and I went on as an instructor.  I didn&#x27;t do much instructing, but I took a full complement of courses in history and in education.  I took some psychology under the late Dr. Dashlei, who was a very great teacher and one of the men brought here by Chase who helped revolutionize the curriculum in this period.  I had some work under E.W. Knight, a great educational historian who was also brought here by Chase. Incidentally, Chase had been a professor of education. We had as head of that school a picturesque old former superintendent by the name of Marcus Cicero Stevens Noble, who taught one little course in the history of education, occupied the position, but he had one of his lieutenants appointed acting dean. And he went on as dean until the position was abolished.  He died about 1940.  The acting ARNOLD KING 15 dean just kept on acting until the 1930&#x27;s. It was one of the most bizarre administrative situations,and I guess since Chase was a friend of both of them he didn&#x27;t know how to solve the problem. At any rate, the acting dean, N.W. Walker, was a good friend of mine.  I&#x27;d say he was a great advocate for me, and I owe him a deep debt. But Billy Noble was also a great friend and advocate, and I owe him a deep debt. There was sort of a feud between Noble and Knight, because Knight was a Ph.D. trained scholar from Columbia University and a graduate of Duke, whereas Billy Noble didn&#x27;t have an A.B. degree and was a former student at Davidson, a superintendent at Wilmington. Well, the institution was more tolerant in those days.  I might say that a very, very good friend of mine came here right after Chase was elected, R.D.W. Connor, who was Secretary of the Historical Commission in Raleigh.  Connor had been a leading contender for the presidency and would have been elected President had it not been for the fact that he was a member of the Board of Trustees,and as such they had a state law that stopped him for a certain period of time and he escaped being elected. He would undoubtedly have been elected had he not been a member of the Board of Trustees.   He came here and was probably the most popular lecturer we&#x27;ve ever had in history, a man of great intellect. He was a real scholar and a fine professor. He was so good that I&#x27;ll say something about him later on.  It was about this time, after I finished the first year of graduate study, that President ChaseI had gone on some trips with him, and he had come to know mecalled me in and asked if I wouldn&#x27;t like to go to Chicago and get a master&#x27;s degree and come back as assistant professor. That was when I protestedI was about twenty-three or -four then__that ARNOLD KING 16 I didn&#x27;t think I was old enough to be assistant professor. [Laughter] Well, I went on to Chicago and had a marvelous year there, 1926-27, and I studied under the great William E. Dodd.  I studied history. Dodd was a native of Clayton, North Carolina, and was probably our most distinguished native son outside of North Carolina. I had other great professors like McLaughlin and Merriam, just a whole cluster. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I KING: At Chicago, I didn&#x27;t have any professors except stars, and I don&#x27;t suppose I&#x27;ve ever spent a richer or more productive year. Even being in a big city, for a country boy like myself, was a revelation, the noises, the smells, especially the smell of the stockyards, the entertainments, the plays, symphonies, fairs.  I even went to hear Amy Semple MacPherson give one of her tremendous evangelistic sermons.  I also saw Jack Dempsey and Carpenter, I believe. Was it Carpenter that fought at Soldiers Field when they opened it in 1927? Oh, I had a glorious time, and I got a real good education there.  I think I came out of there with a master&#x27;s degree better prepared than most of the people that came back that had doctor&#x27;s degrees, because Chicago was a dynamic place at that time. I came back in the fall of 1927,  and I picked up my role as Assistant Professor of the Teaching of History. That was what they called me. And I was inordinately proud, and I may have been a little bit arrogant and snobbish. I was so young, and I&#x27;d been elevated to such great heights.  They had only one other assistant professor here who was as young as I, Urban T. Holmes. Well, he sort of upstaged me, ARNOLD KING 17 because he was such an infant prodigy. He&#x27;d gotten a doctor&#x27;s degree at Harvard at the age of twenty-two or twenty-three, and that kept me in perspective.  I remember shortly after I came back I went up to Hendersonville, and I visited an old lady who took care of me when I was a child. She asked me what I was doing, and I told her I was Assistant Professor of the Teaching of History at the University of North Carolina.  She said, &quot;Is that an important position?&quot; I told her, &quot;Yes.&quot; And I said, &quot;It is an extremely tough position. There&#x27;s not many people that get positions of that kind.&quot; She looked at me sort of wistfully, and she said, &quot;Honey, ain&#x27;t you sort of tender for a tough job at this time?&quot; [Laughter] Properly chastened, I came on back. At that time, we had obtained a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, I believe it was, to reorganize the training of teachers in this country.  I worked for a number of years, both in the School of Education and in the public schools, because we had practice teachers in the public schools, and we gave the pedagogical work in the University. That was my role, with certain deviations, for about the next decade. During this period, of course, the University flourished from &#x27;27 to about &#x27;30. When I came here, the enrollment had suddenly risen to 2,000 students with the influx of veterans. During that decade, we accumulated another thousand. By 1929-30, we had around 3f000 students. Of course, the faculty had increased commensurate with it. We had made such remarkable improvements in that decade as Kenan Stadium, that gave us a distinction that was unique. We had also built the new library, which was one of the marvels of the South at that time, a tremendous library, beautiful, stately, classical Greek architecture. There had been a number of ARNOLD KING 18 other improvements. We had built the dormitories on down as far as where Cobb Dormitory is located now, but not including Cobb. We&#x27;d built dormitories for women over off the Arboretum. For example, the Spencer Building was the first one for women, and three others, I believe, in the quadrangle there. Women had been admitted at the sophomore level to the University, and there were many changes. One of the best changes, I thought, was that we paved Franklin Street. [Laughter]  We then had to pave Cameron Avenue.  Back in those days when I first came here, when it rained it was a mess around here and stayed that way all winter. We also continued to bring in new and fresh blood to the faculty.  The Law School was also completed. There were changes and improvements made in virtually every facet except the Medical School. We had a little two-year medical school here that was located in Caldwell Hall. They had about five or six professors there, as I recall, and they kept the stiffs down in the basement and carried on their work on the other two floors.  It was a primitive and, looking back on it, remarkable sort of operation, but it did turn out good students, and they went on to Virginia and some of them to Harvard, some of them to Pennsylvania, some of them to Jefferson.  It was always a marvel to people how these students graduating from that medical school got such good placement. But for years and years, most of the doctors in North Carolina came out of Caldwell Hall. They had a great professor there by the name of MacNider, who was world-renowned in kidney research. He lent a sort of tone to the place that, I suppose, gave it this outside reputation. During this period, sociology came to the front here under Odum. That&#x27;s ARNOLD KING 19 this decade to 1930. By 1930, we were turning out such scholars and Guy Johnson, as Vance/ and we were populating the sociology departments of the South with the disciples of Odom. We had achieved a real eminence in folk drama and had become a great center of folk literature. There were some moves made to strengthen the sciences, and a fact that&#x27;s not very well known is that they had on the campus of the University a very fine small engineering school, an engineering school that was far superior to the one they had in Raleigh, and it had a staff that was well known.  It was located in Phillips Hall, and you can go to Phillips Hall today and find places where there used to be heavy equipment for testing stresses and strains. And later on this came to be one of the great stresses and strains of the University. I could go on and mention many improvements that were made during this period, but the foundation for a real university was laid during this period 1920 to 1930.  It was exhilarating and a real pleasure to be associated with an organization that was moving, and you knew it was moving.  Those of us that had been off and seen other colleges realized that it was. moving. It was almost inevitable that all good things had to come to an end at least temporarily, and the great bear market of October, 1929 descended on us just like a clap of thunder. I remember it very vividly, because I had married about a month before the market collapsed. [Laughter] I married with the expectation that I would have a salary that was commensurate with the salary I was drawing, which was $3,000 a year and was a pretty good salary for an assistant professor anywhere in a university in this country at that time. I might comment on our salary structure. A full professor got $4,500, an associate professor got $3750, and an assistant professor $3,000. An instructor got somewhere between ARNOLD KING 20 $2,200 and $2,700. Then we had a few distinguished professors around here known as Kenan Professors who got $5,000.  Now they were the cock of the walk. These fellows that had an income of $5,000 a year were really in the money, and sometimes they could teach in the Summer School and make another $500. Pretty nearly everybody wanted to teach in the Summer School, because it supplemented the salaries. Well, there we were, and suddenly the Depression descended on us just like an avalanche. All prices collapsed, values collapsed, and gradually banks collapsed, although we never did have a bank collapse in Chapel Hill.  It was 1931 before the full force of it was felt.  In the meantime, Chase had a good offer to go to the University of Illinois, which he gladly accepted at a higher salary, and he thought it would be a safer place, because the economic base in North Carolina was very, very low.  I knew how low it was because I&#x27;d studied the problem. You&#x27;d be amazed at what the bank deposits were in North Carolina.  I made one of the first studies of that. They wrote editorials all around the state on how poor our financial base was. That left us without a president, and the great question was, Who will take Chase&#x27;s place? Who could take Chase&#x27;s place? Nobody could take Chase&#x27;s place. He was the indispensable man. To make a long story short, there ensued a sort of tug of war between what I would call the old conservatives and the new liberals.  The old conservatives were backing R.D.W. Connor again, who had come here and had almost ten years of activity as a very distinguished professor.  And the liberals were pulling for Frank Graham.  Frank was a good and popular teacher. we&#x27;d been tutting around from the University of Chicago to the Brookings Institution to London School of Economics, and he&#x27;d been engaging in all ARNOLD KING 21 kinds of good works, and he never would get his doctor&#x27;s degree. But fortunately for him, Connor didn&#x27;t have anything but a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He had a bachelor of philosophy, and it was right easy to confuse a bachelor of philosophy in those days with a doctor of philosophy [laughter], but there it was. I was not enough on the inside to ever discover what the determining factor was, but I do remember at commencement in 1930 the trustees held a meeting, and when that meeting was over they had elected Frank Graham President of the University.  Now back in those days, we had a big ball during the commencement season, and we all went to the ball that night.  It was in a building that had been constructed here sometime in the twenties as a substitute gymnasium called the Tin Can.  It was located where the new part of the physical education structure is located now. And I remember my wife and I went to this ball. We&#x27;d been married just about nine months then. We were struck by the swollen eyes; this was literally true.     I want to make it clear that I&#x27;m not imagining this; I&#x27;m not gilding the lily. Here were the great dames of the University who had figured on their man winning, and their taking  over the responsibilities around here, whose eyes were so swollen. They&#x27;d been crying, and they were red, quite obvious. Mrs. Connor, Mrs. Dey and others.  I can say this, because all of these actors now have passed from the scene. But there was consternation among some, and there was joy among the others. Frank had some good friends among the Trustees, and he had other college mates like John J.  Parker, people of that calibre.  They were a very close group, and I have an idea that they carried the day, ARNOLD KING 22 because they wanted a university that would look forward, and they claimed that the others would look backward. So Frank fell into it immediately. He didn&#x27;t have any wife? he didn&#x27;t have any money. He&#x27;d give his money away or lend it to students. He was completely selfless. He was a sort of St. Francis of Assisi, and he was liked by everybody. He could make a tremendous emotional appeal on any subject that he chose to appeal on.  He was irresistible, sort of hypnotic.    We started off with him.  I guess he moved in the old President&#x27;s house. He must have rattled around there, a little fellow scarcely five feet, two inches, and he didn&#x27;t weigh more than, I&#x27;d say, 110 to 115. At that time, he was around forty years of age, maybe a little less. He was in the full vigor of his career, and he showed not the slightest self-consciousness  or the slightest fear for the job. He went at it with considerable verve, but fortunately he had a good business manager in Charlie Woollen. Bob House had come here in 192 6, I believe it was, as Executive Secretary to Chase, and he had learned all the ins and outs of what was going on and knew the ropes. He continued Bob House as his Executive Secretary. His sister Kate, who later married a professor of classics whose name escapes me at the moment, came in to keep house for him, and we were in business. Well, the Depression was deepening. He took over an institution with close to 4,000 students and a budget of something over $800,000.  I&#x27;m talking about a state-appropriated budget, not a state appropriation. Both the students and the budget started eroding, the students because of conditions at home and the budget because of conditions in Raleigh. 0. Max Gardner was the Governor at that time, and it&#x27;s possible that old Max had thrown his weight to Frank, because the ARNOLD KING 23 Governor was Chairman of the Board then.  Economy was in the air, and everybody was looking for ways to economize. Anything that could be cut was cut. Anything that could be eliminated was eliminated. Fortunately, the grant under which I was working ran for enough years that they didn&#x27;t eliminate me, or I might not be here today. [Laughter] That was Rockefeller money. But it ran out pretty soon, and I felt the full force of what happened. One of the expedients for economy that was being kicked around in the state was a proposition that had been suggested by the Brookings Institution.  They made a study, I think for Governor Gardner, and a recommendation tQcconsolidate the university at Chapel Hill, the woman&#x27;s college (it was then known as the North Carolina College for Women) in Greensboro, and North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering in Raleigh. Of course, that was not looked upon with favor by any one of the institutions or the alumni of any one of the institutions.  It was discussed, and there are plenty of records of what went on, and I won&#x27;t even try to describe it, but suddenly the legislature in 1931 put these three institutions together. They consolidated them, and they provided a sort of Roman consulate arrangement temporarily of the three presidents. The President here was Graham, of course; in Greensboro it was Jules I. Foust; and at State, E.C. Brooks.  They formed a sort of triumvirate to run things, and they started discussing putting the three together.  They had a committee of the Board that did much of this.  None of the presidents was in favor of this actively.  The Board started looking for a president.  Now,-------*--------------&quot;~ARNOLD KING 24 this situation, as I recall, went on for about a year, and suddenly, without very much fanfare it seems to me like it was November, 1932 (Frank Graham had kept his mouth shut, he hadn&#x27;t said anything for it while or anything agin it/ the other two had been vocal against it)they elected Frank President of what they called the Consolidated University. And then they went about putting it together. That caused a real donnybrook.  One of the chief opponents of preactically everything that they did   was Watts Hill&#x27;s father, John Sprunt Hill. He fought it right on for the next three years, and it took about three years before they came to any kind of resolution. There was a good deal of confusion, of course, in the three institutions. Frank took over a declining budget. The one here in Chapel Hill had dropped about fifty percent, and the students had dropped radically. They cut our salaries during one period here by thirty-nine percent.  There was one three-month period when we weren&#x27;t even paid. We later on collected it, but we didn&#x27;t have anything to meet the grocery bill or rent bill or anything of that sort. There was a gentleman in Chapel Hill that died last week by the name of Charlie Shields, who ran a little grocery store down on Franklin Street known as the Homeowners Grocery Store, and he issued /tickets, sort of like meal tickets for a cafeteria. It was old my family Charlie Shields that carried me for three months; that&#x27;s the way/ ate.  I thought of him, and was eternally grateful to him.  I had some contact with some of his children in the public school as I carried out the teacher education program. Well, Frank set about reorganizing. He wasn&#x27;t much of an administrator.  I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m telling posterity anything that isn&#x27;t already well known.  He was a great ARNOLD KING 25 spirit, but he wasn&#x27;t a great administrator. He started tearing things up. One of the first things he didI guess it was to solve that problem in the School of Education herehe just abolished the School of Education. [Laughter] He also abolished it at State and Greensboro, and of course education was the chief business at Greensboro. [Laughter] Then he abolished the summer schools of the three and put them all under one administrator. He had a friend, E.W. Knight, that he wanted somewhere in his administration, so he summer program. just put him over the whole /     Well, Knight was a worse administrator than he was. [Laughter] I don&#x27;t know how the Summer School ever existed. course, Frank, of /   was a great pleader in Raleigh, but most of his pleas bolstered our morale here in Chapel Hill and on the other two campuses. Of course, the other two campuses didn&#x27;t love him much, because he had proceeded to get rid of their presidents in pretty short order, and he chose men that he knew,  Harrelson at State and Jackson at Greensboro. They didn&#x27;t call them president, though; they called them &quot;dean of administration.&quot; And he elevated Bob House to Dean of Administration here. Of course, that was not very much to the liking of the academicians, because they wanted a man at least with a Ph.D. degree by that time. The President didn&#x27;t have a Ph.D. degree, and the Dean didn&#x27;t have a Ph.D. degree. One of his best men, L.R. Wilson, might very easily have been made Dean of Administration. Of course, Wilson was the kind of man that didn&#x27;t take fools lightly, and he didn&#x27;t take foolish behavior lightly, so I don&#x27;t think he and Frank would ever have hit it off because of Frank&#x27;s unorthodox administrative style. He got a good job as Dean of the Library School in Chicago, and he took off and stayed there for ten years and then retired and came back home as sort of ARNOLD KING 26 an elder statesman after that, and a very wise and valuable one. The biggest brouhaha they had was over the engineering school, and finally Frank just decided he&#x27;d consolidate both engineering at Chapel Hill schools at Raleigh, and he moved the engineering school/to Raleigh. I remember they had a big ceremony on the campus   here, carried a casket down under the Davie Poplar, and they put up a headstone that read, &quot;Here lies the engineering school of the University of North Carolina, killed in 1936.&quot; [Laughter] Now that old headstone . . . JJ: Twenty-six. KING:  laid around in Phillips Hall for a good while.  I neglected to say that Max Gardner got some of his good friends like Herman Baity involved in this, and      a young man working for him named Tyree Taylor. Well, they were involved in it to some extent, and I think Fred Morrison was. Fred just died recently. And they were all working on    consolidation.  I think, though, that it ought to be said for posterity that some of them got burned in this deal, especially Herman Baity, who hoped to be the dean of the engineering school, and instead of being dean, they moved it out from under him [laughter] and took it to North Carolina State. So I suppose the moral is, you ought to be a little cautious when you&#x27;re engaging in good works. They also abolished    elementary education at Chapel Hill and moved it to Greensboro.  They abolished the school of library science at Greensboro and moved it to Chapel Hill. They abolished the school of business administration at State and moved it to Chapel Hill. That was compensation for moving the engineering school. Graduate study, especially at the doctoral level, was to be concentrated in Chanel Hill. Those are some of the principal rearrangements that they made.  3y 1934, we were beginning to come out of the depression a little bit.  I might say for the record--------------~~&quot;     ---------------- ARNOLD KING 27 that in 1933, my salary had fallen down to about $1,830 a year from $3,000. They were having a meeting of the Southern Education Conference in Chapel Hill.  I saw a couple of fellows from the Rockefeller Foundation, and they were giving out fellowships, and I convinced these two gentlemen to award me a fellowship for $1,800 to go back to the University of Chicago and take another year of graduate .equal to the study, which was about/  salary than I was making.  That shows what had happened, and I had a wonderful year there.  I was married and had one child. They had the remains of the World&#x27;s Fair and all such things as that. I studied hard and had good professors again and returned refreshed and renewed in 1934 and picked up my work again and went on. From 1934 for several years, I worked with Frank on several little projects.  In 1935-36, the University of Chicago awarded me a fellowship that was better than my salary here, so I went back and took a third year.  I was away then during these years: &#x27;26-*27, &#x27;33-&#x27;34, and &#x27;35-,36. Those were stirring years, those latter ones. Roosevelt was just coming in with the New Deal, Hitler was just rising to power in Europe, and during the first time I was there we were having trouble in Nicaragua with the Marines ^occupying it.  I think we got the Marines out in &#x27;32. The Depression got so deep, we couldn&#x27;t afford to keep them there. [Laughter] They&#x27;d have been there yet, I believe.  I suppose that I grew some during those years.  I had a little bad luck.  I had just about finished a doctoral dissertation on the Loyalist movement in North Carolina, and some guy over at Duke published a doctor&#x27;s thesis that he&#x27;d completed and had not registered. That was a great blow to me. I had to go back then and pick up another subject, and I was delayed for years getting a doctor&#x27;s degree because ARNOLD KING 28 of the fact that I was back here at that time with a growing family and with a lot of activities that I had to take care of. During the next few years, I served at one period as Acting Head of the Department of Education.  Then we had a big project on teacher education that involved the three campuses,  and I was made the coordinator for that and, as such, was one of the first officials that ever worked with all three **&quot;&#x27;                      on an active project, and that lasted on into the World War II period. Frank was very active in national affairs.  I accompanied him on some of his trips.  I remember one time we went to Atlantic City to a meeting of the Association of School Administrators, and I spent most of that time hunting Frank&#x27;s hat. [Laughter] He left it every place we touched, but we had a grand time. JJ: Let me ask you something about Dr. Graham. He was obviously far ahead of his time and the rest of the state in the matter of social issues. How did he get by with that in a conservative state? KING: You might remember that we had great difficulty in the disturbances during the thirties. labor./      Along about the time Frank came in, there was trouble in the textile industry. Frank had a lot of friends and former students that were in it and in the labor organizing business. He had friends that were in management, too, and he had some enemies that were in management. He was known as almost a St. Francis of Assisi type of character. He&#x27;d reach in his pocket and give his last dime to anybody that was unfortunate.  If some of his boys that had been in his classes got in labor fracasesand we had lots of labor fracases at that timeand they got in jail, why, he&#x27;d go bail them out. [Laughter] They had to pass a rule that Frank ARNOLD KING 29 it was reported. couldn&#x27;t loan any money to students. The Trustees passed that rule/ It was the only way they could protect him. He was such a transparently Christian character that everybody said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s just Frank Graham. That&#x27;s the way he is. And we&#x27;d rather have Frank Graham with his liberalism, but with his interest and enthusiasm for the University, than to have anybody else.&quot; He had made himself solid with the academic world and was championed far and wide when ihe was criticized. He&#x27;d also gotten in with the administration in Washington and was on some of their advisory boards and so on, and he was able to get WPA money and PWA money and that sort of thing, so he was right valuable in raising money. He was the kind of man that could go out and make an emotional appeal and get student aid money. He was just too valuable to the University to sacrifice because he happened to have a few queer ideas. [Laughter] And everybody tolerated it. [interruption] JJ: Dr. King, let&#x27;s go off on a tangent for a little bit, and let me get you to tell us about your family. KING: I was married August 31 1929, to Edna  Coates of Smithfield, North Carolina.  She was Albert Coates&#x27; sister and a graduate of the Woman&#x27;s College of the University of North Carolina. She taught school for a couple of years in Greensboro, a very lovely and talented young woman who was my faithful companion for over forty-eight years.  She died on the twenty-first of March, 1978. We had a pretty hard time during the early years. Our first child was born the seventh of May, 1931 Arnold Kinsey King, Jr., who graduated from the University and did a four-year tour of duty in the Air Force and graduated from the School of Divinity at Duke and ARNOLD KING 30 has been a Methodist minister in the North Carolina Conference since 1956. He was with us all the time we were in Chicago on the two tours of duty there.  In 194l we had a second child, William Dennis King, who also graduated from the University, in 1963, I believe it was. He is a freelance writer in New York City and has been doing that for the last twenty years and has had considerable success and has published in national magazines, a very brilliant young man. He had certain of the radical tendencies of the 1960&#x27;s and was given to demonstrating and carrying on the way a lot of them did, but I think he&#x27;s settled down to be pretty conservative in his early forties.  We had another child, Mary Ann King, who was born the twenty-first of June, 1946, She went to St. Mary&#x27;s for her high school work and graduated from Duke University in &#x27;68.  She went to San Diego to teach in the public schools. She married a teacher in the public schools out there and has been teaching ever since. She&#x27;s taken graduate work and got steady promotions to about the top of her post.  She&#x27;s a reading specialist.  They have one child. Incidentally, Kinsey has four children, and Dennis doesn&#x27;t have any children, so I have five grandchildren, and if everything goes well I&#x27;ll have a sixth in October. BEGIN SIDE I TAPE II JJ: And you&#x27;ve remarried a fine lady. KING:  When my first wife passed away, I was devastated.  I went out to spend a couple of months with a brother of mine in the Teton Mountains. He had a summer home there.  I came back and picked ARNOLD KING 31 up my work that I was carrying on, and life was pretty dreary for me. My first wife had told my daughter that she hoped that they would not permit me to live in that big house alone by myself, that I ought to have somebody with me.  To make a long story short, after about seven or eight months I got to studying, and I thought about all of the attractive women that had studied under me during the previous forty years.  I happened to think of one who had been in my classes in 1935 and had had practice teaching at the Chapel Hill High School under my direction, and I just thought that, as a matter of course, I&#x27;d look her up. Well, I made some investigations and found out that she had finished a very productive career as a guidance specialist in the Winston-Salem schools and had retired to her farm in Granville County.  They said she lived close to Creedmoor, and I looked in the Durham directory, and lo and behold, I found her name. [Laughter] I called her and asked her if I could come over to see her.  She was sort of reluctant.  I found out later she thought I was trying to set her up to serve on some committee. [Laughter] But she finally consented that I could come over and see her, and I did.  I invited her to go with me to the Duke game, and I saw her a number of times. We gradually got better acquainted, and she consented, after a lot of persuasion and duress, to give up her spinsterhoodshe had never marriedand come to live with me in Chapel Hill. [Laughter] She told me frankly, though, if she had been coming to Creedmoor or to Roxboro or to Yanceyville that she wouldn&#x27;t have taken it up. [Laughter] JJ:  What was her name? KING: Her name was Louise Tumstall, and we were married in the ARNOLD KING 32 spring of 1979, and we&#x27;ve had a very happy life together.  I&#x27;ve made the remark several times that if a man, in the course of a lifetime, has one good wife he&#x27;s lucky.  If he has two good wives, he&#x27;s doubly blessed, so in that respect I have certainly been doubly blessed, and she has been as perfect a replacement for the first wife as one could desire and has fitted in with my family with ease and with dignity and with grace. JJ: We were into the late thirties. KING: Yes.  I spoke about the difficulties we had with the budget. There was some little recovery along during the thirties. Mr. Graham would never admit that the salary scale was anything except that that I gave you a while ago: $5,000 for the distinguished on down to $2,200 for the instructor. And he maintained that fiction all during the Depression, that this was the salary scale [laughter], and at every meeting of the legislature Mr. Graham would tell them what we had to do to get the salary scale back to where it belonged. By 1939 or &#x27;40I&#x27;ve forgotten whichhe&#x27;d managed to get it back to ninety percent of parity, and we maintained that fiction that the salary was at ninety percent of parity until after World War II.  Now can you believe that at the end of World War II, we were still thinking of that same salary structure.  It&#x27;s almost unbelievable, and that was the salary structure we were striving to obtain, and I believe it was 1945 or &#x27;6 that he got it back to parity, and I&#x27;ll come back to that in a few minutes. Mr. Graham, during this period, of course, became more prominent as a national figure, participating in planning in Washington, taking part in labor relations mediation, and advising Mrs. Roosevelt on such things as planning communities for families that were victims of the depression.  Let&#x27;s see now.  She had these ARNOLD KING 33 projects all over the country. He brought her here frequently to speak. He also brought the President here one time to speak at Chapel Hill. He was really deeply involved with the New Deal administration, advising on New Deal measures, and there was some grumbling about his spending too much time away from Chapel Hill. Charlie Woollen, the business manager, died about this time, in 1948, and it was just imperative that we have somebody that could keep up with Frank and his business deals and so on. They made a study of the alumni, and fortunately they hit on the name of Billy Carmichael, who was at that time a stock broker in New York. Billy had been a leading alumnus during part of the time I was here. He&#x27;d made enough money so that he didn&#x27;t need to make any more and was interested in coming home. He came back and took over the business affairs of the University. He took over a lot of the management of the legislature, a lot of the money-raising, and was a real man of projects.  You have heard of the great hucksters. Well, he was truly one of the great hucksters of his time. He was popularly known as &quot;the barefoot boy from Wall Street.&quot; [Laughter] The War was coming closer and closer, and Mr. Carmichael knew that we&#x27;d have a time of troubles when the War came. He was ahead of his time in looking for opportunities. In the first place, he was looking for new buildings and got 6emments from some from the ...  | never can keep the WPA and the PWA separated. I believe it was the WPA, Works Progress Administration. He was looking f or possible opportunities with the Armed Services.  They&#x27;d certainly need schools for training some of their personnel. When the War descended on us, he had figured out all ARNOLD KING 34 of the angles. He made deals with the Navy to bring a V-12 program here.  I believe the V-12 was schooling for general purposes for a number of their seamen.  That was the naval group. And then the V-5, which was especially for those that were going into aviation. Before long, our civilian enrollment had declined from 4,000 to about 1,700, and their places had been taken by servicemen.  I remember that this happened almost overnight.  Their officers moved into private homes around here, but a lot of our men went into the service and their places were vacant.  So far as the town and the University were concerned, we did not suffer from the kind of depression that might have followed all the students leaving. During this period, many of us converted to other things.  I know that I became an adviser in the General College and also taught American history in the V-12 program here for three or four years.  I also kept up what little work there was to do in the School of Education, but by this time I&#x27;d pulled out of the responsibility for any high school work and had been administrator of the project I told you about a while ago. Also during this period, I might mention it for    it&#x27;s   antiquarian interest, I think I was among the first of the college professors to get a job as a real adviser to the government. The Tennessee Valley Authority had come to be a real important agency in this area in western North Carolina. For four years during the late thirties and early forties, I was on a panel that advised the Tennessee Valley Authority. Several times a year, about four or five times, I&#x27;d go over to Durham and take the train to Knoxville and advise for two or three days and then take the train back. Recently I looked in my files for something, and I ran across an old application for a travel voucher, and you might be ARNOLD KING 35 interested that on that travel voucher I found bus fare to Durham, twenty-five cents; taxi fare to the railroad, twenty-five cents; $17.50 for a round-trip ticket to Knoxville; $3.00 a day for subsistence for five days, I believe it was; and then coming back, I had twenty-five cents from the hotel to the railroad station, taxi fare, and I had twenty-five cents from Durham to the bus station, and twenty-five cents from the bus station to Chapel Hill.  I presume that all of thatyou can count it upis  less than fifty dollars. And here I was staying at the old Andrew Johnson Hotel for $1.50 a day [laughter] in the late thirties, and eating for thirty-five cents a meal.  It&#x27;s just fabulous.  I figured that it would take at least $500 right now. JJ:  Oh, yes. KING: An inflation factor of about ten times.  I mention that just as an illustration of changing times.  Well, we had some building going on around here.  The Medical School had built Manning Hall and moved over on the Pittsboro Road. The Navy wanted a better infirmary, so they built a good, big infirmary over there by the side of the Medical School. They wanted a bigger swimming pool, especially, and they built the Kissing Swimming Pool.  Kissing was the commander of the unit here. They built what&#x27;s known as Navy Hall. [Laughter] It&#x27;s not much of a Navy hall, but they built it.  It was a replica, incidentally, of Swain Hall, except in red brick.  Not many people know that. We managed to make our way through the War years, except we had some bizarre circumstances. Many of our faculty had gone away, and we hired foreigners to do a lot of the teaching.  I remember that one of my advisees in the General College was a lad of about 16.ARNOLD KING 36 They were letting younger boys come, fifteen, sixteen. He came down, and he flunked. His father came to see me, and he said, &quot;Now, Mr. King, I want to explain. My son had a Chinese teacher in math, and this Chinese couldn&#x27;t speak English. He had a Czech teaching him political science, and that Czech couldn&#x27;t speak English. [Laughter] He had a Honduran trying to teach him Spanish, and the Honduran couldn&#x27;t speak English.  Don&#x27;t you think the boy deserves a second chance?&quot; I said, &quot;He not only deserves a second chance, I&#x27;m going to see that the second time around he gets English-speaking teachers.&quot; [Laughter] That&#x27;s just a simple illustration of some of the things that happened to us. But Frank Graham was off in Washington most of the time. He was mediating various labor disputes. I suppose that everybody&#x27;s heard of his famous mediation of the coal strike.  I might as well put it on the record. They had a terrific coal strike, and they couldn&#x27;t settle it. Finally, they put Frank Graham and John L. Lewis in a hotel room and told them to stay there until they settled it, and they negotiated for twelve hours, and finally they came out with a settlement. One of the first things that John L. Lewis said after they announced the settlement was, &quot;Who in the hell ever put me in a hotel room for twelve hours with that sweet little son of a bitch?&quot; [Laughter] Well, the War did end, and the sailors left about as suddenly as they came, and we had one heck of a hiatus between September, 1945, and January, 1946.  In the meantime, Frank had reorganized the Graduate School another time. He had one dean over the whole Graduate School, and that wasn&#x27;t working out too well. He was Whatley Pierson. He couldn&#x27;t be everywhere at one time.  So ARNOLD KING 37 Frank called me in one day.  It must have been September, 1945. He said, &quot;Arnold, how would you like to be Associate Dean of the Graduate School at Chapel Hill? I&#x27;m going to make an associate dean on each campus to be responsible for that campus, and Whatley will be sort of responsible over it all.  I want you to run it, though.&quot; I said, &quot;What does Dean Pierson think about it?&quot; He said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be talking with you if he hadn&#x27;t suggested it.  Will you take the job?&quot; Well, I took it, and I held the job for the next thirteen years, from &#x27;45 to *58. Frank says, &quot;Now, Arnold, I don&#x27;t have but one piece of advice to give you. You&#x27;re going to be making a lot of decisions. Don&#x27;t ever make a personal decision. Let the University make all these decisions.  If you have a student that can&#x27;t be admitted to the Graduate School, don&#x27;t tell him, *I can&#x27;t admit you.&#x27;  Tell him that under the regulations of the University,  we are sorry that he is ineligible for admission. Always put your decisions in the name of the University, and you won&#x27;t get into trouble.&quot; Well, I have an idea that was the secret to his success, and that is the only instruction for educational administration I&#x27;ve ever had, and I spent the next thirteen years on that job. And believe me, when school opened in January, it was the kind of rush that hasn&#x27;t been seen since the Gold Rush of 1848.  The GIs moved in on us, and within a remarkably short period of time we had not 1,500 students but 7t500 [laughter], and 1,500 of those were in the Graduate School. And I had to do all the work for admitting them, for looking after them. We had a catalog to edit; we had a research publication that had to be edited.  I soon learned that you had to have some kind of help that wasn&#x27;t available.  So I bought an old-time dictaphone, and I had three secretaries. For the next several years, I spent all of my time on that dictaphone.  I wrote the equivalent of several books. During the thirteen years there, I edited thirteen volumes of ARNOLD KING 38 Research in Progress, which was a great big book about that size, and put out a catalog every year. I also looked after all the admissions. I looked after all of the records.  I had secretaries helping me do that.  I had periodic meetings of the Administrative Board of the Graduate School. That was the way  a sghool operated, with an administrative board. And frequently we had trials of one kind and another [laughter] to be conducted.   It was quite a job, and I don&#x27;t know how I survived it, but I did. During this time, there were a number of developments in the University that I ought to mention. Probably the most significant was the Good Health Movement that was spearheaded by Billy Carmichael. Of course, he was helped by Frank Graham and by Bob House, by Reece Berryhill.  Incidentally, there&#x27;s an interesting story there I&#x27;d like to put on the record.  Sometime during the thirties, they had a brouhaha here over the admission of Jewish students to the Medical School. Dean Manning wanted a quota, and Frank Graham was opposed to quotas, and they came to a clash, and Dean Manning resigned. Frank was very popular with some of the prominent North Carolinians that were members of the Jewish faith, and he genuinely didn&#x27;t believe in any kind of discrimination. I&#x27;ll say a little something about the blacks in a minute. During this period, he put Dr. MacNider in as Dean of the Medical School. I was in Frank&#x27;s office on some sort of business, and the telephone rang, and he picked it up, and it was Dr. MacNider. Dr. MacNider said in a loud and explosive voice, &quot;Frank, I don&#x27;t want to be any damn dean.  I want to get rid of this job.&quot; He might have had a drinkhe was known to take onebut he was sick and tired of that ARNOLD KING 39 job, and he wanted to get rid of it. Frank said, &quot;Well, Dr. MacNider, we need you there. We need your name.&quot; He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be there any longer.  I&#x27;ve got to get out.  It&#x27;s just pressing me down.  I can&#x27;t do my research.&quot; Well, he said, &quot;How about if we got you an associate dean to do all the work, and all you&#x27;d have to do is lend us your name?&quot; He said, &quot;It might work if you can find one.&quot; He said, &quot;I can find one.  I&#x27;ve got one in mind right now. How would Reece Berryhill do?&quot; He said, &quot;That&#x27;d be fine.  I&#x27;ll stay on with the title if you&#x27;ll get Reece to do the work.&quot; He hung up and picked up the phone and rang the InfirmaryReece was the Infirmary doctor at that timeand said, &quot;Reece, I want you to pack up and leave there tomorrow and go over to the Medical School and be Associate Dean of the School of Medicine.&quot; [laughter] Reece was sort of startled, but he didn&#x27;t know what else to do but say, &quot;Well, what will we do with the Infirmary?&quot; He said, &quot;You leave that to me. You&#x27;ve got a good man there, Ed Hedgpeth.  I&#x27;ll make Ed the head of the Infirmary, and you separate yourself from the Infirmary right now and go over there.&quot; He hung up, and he turned to me and he said, &quot;Arnold, I&#x27;ve just made a dean. Let&#x27;s see what happens to him.&quot; [Laughter] Well, he became one of the most distinguished medical deans in the country, but he and Frank never got along together very well. He was too impatient. He had a lot to do with that Good Health Movement. They organized a committee of which Kay Kyser at first was one of the spearheads.  That&#x27;s another story.  I won&#x27;t go into it except to say that in the midst of all this, Kay became devoted to the Christian Science movement and withdrew. [Laughter] They carried through, with all the opposition from Duke, with all the ARNOLD KING 40 opposition from Greensboro. They wanted a medical school over there, and Frank said the medical school was going to be here, that a medical school ought to be on the campus.  It ought not to be way off in another town. And he stuck by that, and by 1948 the decision had been made, and they were working on the medical school building of the hospital. An interesting story in connection with that was that we had a local boy that was reputed to be a slow learner, to say the least, and he was very interested in that big hole they dug for the first hospital. He went over and he looked down in it, and a fellow way down there was digging dirt. He said to the fellow, &quot;Whatcha diggin&#x27; that big hole fer?&quot; And the fellow said, &quot;To bury all the sons of bitches in Chapel Hill in it.&quot; [Laughter] And the town idiot said, &quot;Well, who&#x27;s going to cover them up?&quot; [Laughter] Well, it wasn&#x27;t long before they were in business, and I believe they graduated the first class in 1952, if I remember correctly. That was a great movement, though, that covered the whole state, [interruption] Frank Graham was always full of surprises as an administrator.  I worked with him very closely in the Graduate School, and I&#x27;ll just give a few illustrations of how he operated. One morning he came in to see me, and he said, &quot;Arnold, I was in New York last weekend, and I got a chance to pick up the Department of Statistics at Columbia University and move it down here bodily.  It&#x27;s a very distinguished operation, and the Rockefeller Foundation gave me enough money to move them down here. I wish you would go over to Phillips Hall and tell Archibald Henderson to clear out the east wing of that hall to put the new staff in.&quot; Well, I asked him how many there were, and he had a pretty sizeable group.  I asked him what ARNOLD KING 4l kind of salaries he was paying them. He said he was paying Dr. HotelLing, the head of the department, $12,000 a year. And I said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that a little bit high for the rest of them around here?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ll look after them later.&quot; To make a long story short, I didn&#x27;t tackle Archibald Henderson.  I went to John Lasley, who was his chief assistant, and I told John that the President was bringing the statistics department here, and he wanted them to clear out the east wing of the building and be ready for them to move in in fifteen days.  I said, &quot;Now, I&#x27;m going to let you break that to Archibald.  [Laughter] I don&#x27;t want anything to do with it.&quot; [Laughter] Archibald wasn&#x27;t going to be a head too much longer anyway, so I don&#x27;t think he ever put up much of a scrap about it. But when the rest of the faculty found out what Hotelling was making and he was put in the Graduate School, they descended on me, several of the brethren, and they said, &quot;This is an affront to the rest of us, to hire a man and pay him that much. The rest of us are just getting, at the most, $6,000 a year now.  We ought to file a public protest.&quot; I said, &quot;Now wait a minute.  If HotelLing is worth $12,000 a year, there must be some of the rest of us that are worth $12,000 a year. Instead of filing a protest, the thing for us to do is to appeal to Frank to raise the salaries of all of us to $12,000, or at some figure between $6,000 and $12,000 which he thinks we merit. Let&#x27;s not  start rebelling now; let&#x27;s start bucking for higher salaries.&quot; And I&#x27;m satisfied that Hotelling&#x27;s $12,000 salary was worth maybe. . . There&#x27;s no telling how much it was worth to the rest of us, because it wasn&#x27;t long before we were getting a number of salaries up to $12,000. Now another time, he appeared on the scene and said he&#x27;d ARNOLD KING 42 found a department of city and regional planning, and he asked me if I knew where we could put it.  I told him there was one of those empty temporary buildings that the Navy built, and we might put them there. [Laughter] And we did, and that&#x27;s the way we got  city and regional planning. He just brought them here. Didn&#x27;t ask anybody. And then another time, he talked the Gray family into giving a distinguished professorship to teach the Bible.  He put us on a search for a man to teach the Bible. We looked and looked all over the country, and we were just about to settle on the man who later became Bishop Goodson in the Methodist Church, a distinguished man, a Biblical scholar. But Frank came rushing in one morning, and he said, &quot;Arnold, I&#x27;ve found us a professor to teach the Bible.  You needn&#x27;t look any further.&quot;  I said, &quot;Where in the world did you get him, Frank?&quot; He said, &quot;I was in a meeting with him up in Chicago, and he looked so good, I just hired him.&quot; And I said, &quot;What&#x27;s his name?&quot; He said, &quot;Arnold Nash.&quot; I said, &quot;What&#x27;s his standing as a Biblical scholar?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;he sounded to me like he knew a good deal about it, and he knows a lot about the sociology of religion.&quot; I said, &quot;Have you already hired him?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, you&#x27;d better clear it with the Grays. They told you to get a professor of Biblical literature.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;you just leave the Grays to me.&quot; [Laughter] To make a long story short, the Grays didn&#x27;t like his professor of Biblical literature, and they wouldn&#x27;t pay for it [laughter], so he had to find state money for Arnold Nash, who stayed around here and taught something similar to the sociology of religion till he retired. And we had to start all over again looking ARNOLD KING 43 for a man to teach the Bible.  In the end, we found, you may remember, Bernie Boyd, who was one of the most successful teachers we ever had here and one of the most popular television and radio artist, too. He, unfortunately, died too young, but it was a great thing. Frank obviously was getting a little restive, and he accepted the invitation of the Governor to be appointed to the Senate.  What happened thereafter is well known.  He didn&#x27;t win the election. He went to the United Nations. He spent probably a longer time to arbitrate a dispute between two of the Indian factions than any man that ever tried.  That was the way he spent the rest of his career. He visited here frequently. He spoke here occasionally.  I didn&#x27;t see too much of him until he came back. He had a devastating case of shingles that put him in the hospital, and he was sick for three or four years before he died. His wife died, and that was also a great blow to him. He moved in with Kate out in Gimghoul. Her husband had died.  I spent an hour with him about a week before he died. He was over at Memorial Hospital. We worked over all the old times. He had the fire with him to the very end and, I would say, was certainly one of the great men of this century in North Carolina, a great spirit who moved people. He was a mover and a great evangelist, a great missionary for causes, but he wasn&#x27;t much of an administrator.  If he hadn&#x27;t had Bob House on the inside and Billy Carmichael on the outside, he would have just been swamped.  They when Frank was appointed to the Senate, started a search immediately for a successor/ and they brought in all kinds of people, one man from Yale, who almost got the job. But at about this juncture, the race issue really heated up, and we were sued by McKissick and some of his cohorts. McKissick was a law student ARNOLD KING 44 at Durham. And I might digress here a little bit to say that I worked with the people in Durham for twenty-five years. Back in 1939i there was a Supreme Court decision that found that if you didn&#x27;t give blacks equal facilities, you couldn&#x27;t keep them separate, but if you gave them separate but equal facilities, you didn&#x27;t have to admit them to your campus programs for the whites.  This was &#x27;39 that that decision came out, a famous decision that had to do with Lincoln in Missouri, College/  I believe it was. We started building up the college over m Durham and helping them get state appropriations and so on. Billy Carmichael came about that time, and Billy was doing everything he could to help build up a liberal arts college with a law school and a school of education, a school of library science, and other things.  I worked with them in education from 1939 to 1964, which was a period of about twenty-five years. I helped plan the education building over there. I helped them select 50,000 books for their library and helped plan the library.  I spent one whole semester .a over there, and it was/very rewarding, but in the end rather futile, operation, because what I helped them do was to institute a doctor&#x27;s degree. And when we had all of the later development in higher education, that    doctor&#x27;s degree, on the recommendation of the Board    of Higher Education, was abolished.  So what I did there resulted in about half a dozen doctor&#x27;s degrees awarded to blacks who had what I would call the best of instruction from professors at Duke and Chapel Hill and one of two of their own.  It did leave them with a good base for a master&#x27;s program because of all the books and the equipment and so on that I helped assemble there. Well, Billy Carmichael was involved in that, and he helped them get ARNOLD KING 45 a law school, and the first law school was participated in by professors from Duke and Carolina. When I was advising Dr. Shepard, who was their first President, I asked him one day, &quot;Dr. Shepard, how many students you got in your law school?&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got five.&quot; I said, &quot;How many professors do you have?&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got six professors.&quot; I said, &quot;Dr. Shepard, isn&#x27;t that a little bit extravagant, to have five students taught by six different professors?&quot; He laughedhe had a real infectious laughhe reached over, and he patted me on the shoulder, and he said, &quot;Young fellow, you white folks are going to have to learn that segregation comes high.&quot; [Laughter] BEGIN SIDE II TAPE II KING: Dr. Shepard was a great man with whom to work, and he told me one of the best Billy Carmichael stories I&#x27;ve ever heard. This good Billy Carmichael story was about when he was helping them get new buildings and new equipment and so on. He said, &quot;Now, Dr. Shepard, I want you to know that I personally understand the plight of minorities.&quot; And Dr. Shepard told me that he reached over and patted him on the knee, and he said, &quot;Dr. Shepard, you know, I&#x27;m a member of a minority in North Carolina. You&#x27;re black, and I&#x27;m a Catholic.  In all of these great disputes, us minorities have got to stick together.&quot; [Laughter] And Dr. Shepard would tell that, and he&#x27;d just cackle. [Laughter] Well, as I said, in this era the blacks were not satisfied with the kind of separate-but-equal that they were getting, and they sued, and, as you know, they won their suit and got admitted to the Law School.  I digress, because ARNOLD KING 46 at this juncture we were hunting for a president. They brought a man down from YaleI won&#x27;t mention his nameand they were just about to settle on him, and Billy Carmichael thought they&#x27;d better explore his attitude toward blacks. And he told him, &quot;We&#x27;ve been having some difficulty here, racial problems, and how do you stand on that?&quot; This man from Yale said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve never had much trouble with the blacks, but I&#x27;ve had a good deal of trouble with another minority, the Catholics.&quot; That was the last we heard of him. [Laughter] To make a long story short, they found their man in Washington, who was Secretary of the Army, Gordon Gray. He pas a graduate of the University, President of Phi Beta Kappa, had gone on to Yale to get his law training, and I believe he&#x27;d been in the legislature of North Carolina. He&#x27;d run the newspaper in Winston-Salem, was a distinguished member of the Gray family in Winston-Salem, and they looked for great things from him. I remember the first administrators&#x27; meeting he called in his office in South Building and the way he opened the meeting. He said, &quot;Now, you&#x27;re the people administering this institution at Chapel Hill. I want you to answer one question for me, and that question is, why does Davidson have a better undergraduate program than the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill?&quot; I was always a little brash. The rest of them sat there stunned that he&#x27;d ask a question of that kind. Well, I said, &quot;Mr. Gray, before we try to answer your question, there&#x27;s one I&#x27;d like to ask you, and that is, who told you that Davidson has a better undergraduate program than the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill?&quot; I was never very ARNOLD KING 47 popular with him thereafter, although he didn&#x27;t fire me, but he was always pretty cool toward me. JJ: What was his answer? KING: He didn&#x27;t try to answer it. The head man doesn&#x27;t have to answer questions. But he went on to tell us that he would like to have the University of North Carolina known as an institution that had as good an undergraduate program as Davidson and as good a graduate program and law program as Yale. Well, he set about making some rearrangements of the program, and he had a series of inter-university conferences. He had one of them presided over by Howard Odom. We brought in another high-powered mathematician to match Hotelling, by the name of Weyburn, and Gray made him chairman of one of the conferences. They did a lot of good in making suggestions as to how we could improve, and then he called in a management consultant by the name of McCormick, Cr&#x27;-esap. and Paget.  They arrived on the scene, and what they did was to ask us for all of the data. I must have spent endless hours preparing data for McCormick, Cresapand Paget. Then they came up with a number of suggestions as to how the University could be improved, and we had told them most of what they told Gordon Gray. And they told him how he could improve his office, too, how it could be reorganized, and he got himself a staff, which he needed, because it early became obvious that he didn&#x27;t know much about the academic world. He brought in some good men to help him. Then he found that he needed an assistant, and he reached into Fred Weaver&#x27;s office Fred Weaver was the Dean of Students on the Chapel Hill campusand got his young assistant, William Friday^ to ARNOLD KING 48 be his assistant. William Friday was the Assistant Dean of Students. Incidentally, during this period I&#x27;d helped Fred get a fellowship to Harvard so he could get himself a master&#x27;s degree, and while he was gone he put William Friday in as the Acting Dean of Students on the Chapel Hill campus, and that was one of the first recognitions that Friday had. But Friday had been mentioned as a promising young man that we ought to keep on the campus, because we ought not to let the young men that had talent for administration get away. Friday served him well and helped him. He also had been helpful to President Graham  and had been especially helpful to him in his election, even though he lost, for the Senate. Mr. Friday was also a good friend of Claude Teague,  who had come in as the Business Manager on the Chapel Hill campus and had borne the brunt of all the GI invasion of the late forties. Now this is getting into the fifties, you see.  I&#x27;ve forgotten when Gray came on. JJ: Nineteen-fifty, I believe. KING:  It was sometime about &#x27;50. His wife died about the middle of his administration, and that was very devastating to him. He was, I&#x27;d say, drafted by Eisenhower to serve on that ill-fated commission having to do with the Oppenheimer case, and he cast the deciding vote against Oppenheimer. Well, from that time on he was not in much favor among academicians in America, because the academicians sympathized with Oppenheimer, and I&#x27;ve never seen anybody who thought Oppenheimer was a communist spy or anything of that sort. But the question was the clearance of Oppenheimer for handling classified information, and he voted against giving hirn clearance.  Gray was away a good deal. ARNOLD KING  49 Billy Carmichael was Acting President part of the time.  The man whom Gray selected for his Academic Vice-President was Harris Purks.  Along toward the end of his administration, Gray was gone again on some mission for Eisenhower, and Purks was, for the time being, made Acting President. Now there&#x27;s another crosscurrent that comes in at this juncture that I&#x27;ll have to mention.  Gray had aroused the lesser institutions in the state because he was charged with being an elitist, and in his dealing with the legislature he&#x27;d especially aroused President J.D. Messick of ECTC (as it was known in those days), East Carolina Teachers College.  I can&#x27;t go into all this, but it had led to the movement that brought another layer of educational administration in to arbitrate between the University and the teachers&#x27; colleges, as they were known.  It was thought to be a sort of tool of the University in the beginning that would see that these others were kept in their place, and Harris Purks was chosen, I believe, the first Director of the Board of Higher Education.  That left a hiatus, because by this time there were those that didn&#x27;t want to make Billy Acting President, because they felt that if they ever made him Acting President he might end up as President, and they didn&#x27;t think that Billy was the kind of president we wanted for the Consolidated University. So in March, I believe it was, 1956, Gray resigned and they made Bill Friday Acting President. Then they started looking for a President of the University, and they looked and they looked.  Luther Hodges was the Governor of North Carolina, and Victor Bryan was one of the powerful members on the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees.  They searched all the summer of &#x27;56 and considered, and Mr. Friday showed great skill in managing the affairs of the University, ARNOLD KING 50 and he also showed skill in dealing with Purks on the Board of Higher Education. So, to make a long story short, in October, I believe it was, 1956, they made Mr. Friday the President of the University, and there was a good deal of consternation, of course. Here was a man that had little experience in academic affairs. He hadn&#x27;t ever taught any. His contact with one of the institutions had been as Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, and, as far as the Chapel Hill people were concerned, he was also a graduate of State, which was not any high recommendation for him. JJ: Not even though he graduated from law school in Chapel Hill. KING: He graduated from the Law School in Chapel Hill, but I think candor would have to say that he was not what you&#x27;d call a distinguished graduate. He was a good, average graduate of the Law School, but he showed talent as an administrator. Mr. Friday himself tells the story that right after he was elected he was walking down the street, I believe it was down toward the Post Office on the campus, and there were two professors on the Carolina campus that did not recognize that he was nearby, and he could overhear them. One of them said to the other one, &quot;After all those glorious years with Frank Graham, just look what we&#x27;ve got now for our President.      A man that&#x27;s never taught a day in his life.&quot; And, I guess they were thinking, a graduate of State College and just an average student in the Law School. [Laughter]  Well, Mr. Friday took charge       with great verve. He had to get a chancellor at Chapel Hill; he had to get a chancellor at State; he had to get one on the Greensboro campus, and the man he had to remove on the Greensboro campus was a cousin of Frank Graham. The man he had to ARNOLD KING  51 replace at Chapel Hill was sixty-five, but he was already a legend in his own time, Bob House.  I won&#x27;t go into the politics of all of that. I will say that he replaced Bob House with Bill Aycock, also a State College man [laughter] and looked on askance by a lot of people, and a fellow law student.  The man to be replaced at State, Cary Bostian, had a distinguished career in genetics, but found administration trying. Friday went outside after three years and got a Ph.D. from Princeton who had been president of a little college in Alabama, and was at that time President of the University of Arkansas, John Caldwell.  He selected Gordon  Blackwell, the Director of the Institute for Social Science at Chapel Hill, for his man in Greensboro.  They turned out to be a good team, and I expect they helped him through his early years with a good deal of success. JJ:  What happened to you personally after &#x27;58? KING:  Well, they had a lot of ambitious young men that had to be satisfied:  there were Gordon Blackwell and Alec Heard on Friday&#x27;s hands. Both of them wanted to be chancellor here, and he wanted to appoint Aycock, of course.  So he appointed Aycock here, and he appointed Blackwell to be Chancellor in Greensboro.  They reorganized graduate study and made the job here Dean, and they made Alec Heard Dean.  And, of course, I moved out of the picture, and Aycock asked me to take over the job of putting together the long-range plan for Chapel Kill, which I did in the spring of 1958.  I kept on until Alect Heard got here, in the Graduate School, and then after I finished the year, putting together the long-range plan, Aycock asked me  if  I didn&#x27;t want to ARNOLD KING 52 be Director of the Summer School.  I told him that understood a nan had been brought in to be the Director of the Suiauer School.  Aycock said they didn&#x27;t ask him anything about it [laughter], and he was going to appoint me.  Guy Phillips had brought    in a man to succeed him, but the Chancellor exercised his prerogative, and he appointed me. JJ: When did you join the General Administration staff? KING: I continued from &#x27;58 to &#x27;64 as Director of the Summer Session. Mr. Friday started talking with me about joining his staff periodically, and I was getting along in years then. As a matter of fact, he was in my office trying to convince me that I ought to join his staff in June, 1963, at the very hour the Speaker Ban law was passed. [Laughter] He was in my office.  Terry Sanford was out of BLaleigh.  Hep. Phil Goodwin, I believe it was, and his associates, were running the last day of the Ligislature fast and furious.  The/ did it all in an hour.  Well, / Mr. Friday had his hands full then, but I&#x27;ll come back to that in a little bit.  I&#x27;d like to say that Aycock was a great Chancellor. He was a real great Chancellor. He had the interest of the institution at heart, and I sat with him for all those six years.  I was on his cabinet, and he had a real good team that ran the University with a good deal of authority.  Now back during the Frank Graham days, they didn&#x27;t have a vice-chancellor for academic affairs. They just had the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of the General College, and the Associate Dean of the Graduate School make the budget every year.  There for seven or eight years, Bill Wells and Shorty Spruill and I made all the budgets and looked after all the salaries.  It ought to be in the record that is was an informal sort of arrangement. We practically told House ARNOLD KING 53 what to do on salaries, and he did it. Now and then he&#x27;d have an old friend he wanted to reward, and would do it with grace and dignity. But during Aycock&#x27;s administration, he had the University organized tightly and put it together with a team that looked after academic affairs and looked after student affairs and looked after business affairs and after development. He set the organization that they have on the campus now, and it has lasted to this day with very little change. Sow,  they&#x27;ve got more people. When he became chancellor, we must have had about 7,500 to 8,000 students, and they have just gradually built up to 20,000 now. I stayed there, and I did planning work for the Chancellor, I ran the Summer School, and I did a few odd jobs for Mr. Friday.  There&#x27;s another crosscurrent we&#x27;ve got to bring in here. We were having trouble with the Board of Higher Education, a lot of trouble.  They&#x27;d change it every time they got a new governor.  They got some young men on the Board that wanted to run everything and didn&#x27;t have the authority to do it.  I won&#x27;t mention any names; they&#x27;re so young that they&#x27;ll outlast me, and I don&#x27;t want to put it in the record. But the Board of Higher Education was a disaster. During Terry Sanford&#x27;s administration, he appointed the Carlisle Commission that made recommendations of what to do.  They made recommendations with respect to the community colleges. Mr. Friday took a leading role in that. They made recommendations with respect to the expansion of the University to other campuses. They made recommendations with respect to the role of the teachers&#x27; colleges. Now over the sixties, changes came so rapidly, and the teachers&#x27; colleges, due to the GI Bill also, had expanded so much in enrollment that by the time of the Carlisle Commission it was evident that something had to be done. ARNOLD KING 54 Terry Sanford got some reorganization, and the University reorganized in I963 and &#x27;64.  It organized to the extent that men were admitted to all the campuses; women were admitted to all the campuses [laughter]; the Ph.D. degree was given on all the campuses; and they all changed their names: the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And then they had one heck of a brouhaha over the name of State.  I won&#x27;t go into all of that; it&#x27;s dreary and depressing. [Laughter] And, in addition to those brouhahas, Mr. Friday had had an earlier brouhaha over the Dixie Classic.  The gamblers moved in on the Dixie Classic.  They were threatening the lives of some of the players.  We were having trouble with basketball, especially, on both the Chapel Hill and the State campus. Most people don&#x27;t pay much attention to It nowadays, but Aycock fired old McGuire for not living up to the rules and regulations of the NCAA. And Mr. Friday abolished the Dixie Classic to get rid of the gamblers, and they almost got him at that time, because he had destroyed the one great social event they still had in eastern North Carolina. [Laughter] Then at about this time, the Speaker Ban controversy broke on us, and it was about this time that I appeared on the scene because the Board of Trustees had authorized us to look into the expansion of the University, and they hired me to do that. I became Vice-President for University Studies in February of 1964, .and I studied the /expansion to Charlotte and the expansion to Asheville and the expansion to Wilmington, and all of those occurred from 1965 on to 196 7.  It was this expansion of the University then that exacerbated the movement on the part of the teachers* colleges to become universities, and they had enough political umph to defy the ARNOLD KING  55 Board of Higher Education and to have every one of them made instant universities by legislative action, just as we had at Charlotte, Asheville, and Wilmington made instant universities. [Laughter]  Here was a helpless Board of Higher Education that couldn&#x27;t bring any order out of chaos.  Here was a university expanding, and here were all of these teacher colleges that had expanded into universities by name, and each one of them had the authority to give a doctor&#x27;s degree.  And then, on top of all this, there was the brouhaha over the East Carolina University Medical School.  That sets the stage for what came by way of restructuring, but before that Mr. Friday had to face the great struggle over the Speaker Ban law.  That went on for years, and the Speaker Ban lawmost people don&#x27;t know itactually was finally gotten rid of by the Federal court finding it unconstitutional.</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Asa T. Spaulding, longtime actuary at the historically black North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company--and its president from 1959 to 1968--recalls his efforts to prepare Durham, North Carolina, for desegregation. Spaulding grew up in an environment relatively free from discrimination, so after his education at New York University and the University of Michigan, he brought to Durham a determination that racial barriers were artificial and needed to be dismantled. He did so not with overt activism, but by using his influence to bring together white and black business leaders at North Carolina Mutual. These business meetings not only brought together creative thinkers, they also modeled successful integration before the civil rights movement had scored its victories in the early 1960s. In this interview, Spaulding reflects on how his growing influence as a business leader allowed him to make unique contributions to dismantling segregation in Durham. Researchers and students might also consult the two other interviews with Spaulding in this collection, C-0013-1 and C-0013-3. Those interested in learning more about the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and black business in the South might turn to the interviewer&#x27;s book, Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  WALTER WEARE: Well, I think we can reconstruct this, maybe just reading the letter. And I&amp;#x0027;ll try to pick up the pieces. We&amp;#x0027;ll proceed with the letter from Colonel Lowery.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I shall now read a letter: Earl C. Lowery, M.D., FACS, FICS 5403 Hardwood Drive Des Moines, Iowa 50312 Now the Calvin Lowery, referred to by Dr. Earl Lowery, his sisters were Annabell, who was my mother, Debra, Nancy, Susan, and Maria, whose nickname was Bobby. The brothers were Henry, Abner, William, Canada, French, Edward, and Fuller.  WALTER WEARE: This is all one marriage&amp;#x2014;all those children?  ASA T. SPAULDING: All those children from one marriage.  WALTER WEARE: The Lowery family then descends from&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: From Judge Henry Lowery.  WALTER WEARE: And it was back in 17&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Who arrived here in 1666 and settled at Hampton, Virginia, with his wife and three sons. And his family records show that he was born thirty miles from London.  WALTER WEARE: And somewhere in that geneology, is it 1738, where one of the Lowerys married a Priscilla?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. James Lowery Junior, married in 1738 in North Carolina. And he married Priscilla Barry, who was one-half Tuscarora Indian.  WALTER WEARE: So it&amp;#x0027;s 1738 that the Indian-White connection is made.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And the next we have there, William Lowery, who was a veteran in the Revolutionary War, and the file number for that is 6732. He married Betty Locklear. So that seemed to be the second. And then Allen Lowery, 1791-1865, married Polly Cumboldt. She was the daughter of S. Cumboldt&amp;#x2014;I guess that&amp;#x0027;s &amp;#x2018;Stephen&amp;#x2019;&amp;#x2014;who was a veteran of the War of 1812. And she, of course, was white.  WALTER WEARE: Now, we&amp;#x0027;re not sure of who was Indian and who was not Indian, in those marriages that followed 1738. But that&amp;#x0027;s the beginning of the Indian connection.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, we have one more: Henry Berry Lowery, who was the son of Allen Lowery. He was born in 1848. And we&amp;#x0027;re not certain of just when he died, or where he died. That has not been discovered until now&amp;#x2014;or if discovered has not been revealed. And he married Rhoda Strong.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think she was Indian?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I&amp;#x0027;m not sure. It seems to me that there&amp;#x0027;s something in one of these other letters that I received, that indicates her racial identity. Cut it off while I look in the book. [interruption]   ASA T. SPAULDING: This gives his name, Stephen Cumboldt, soldier, War of 1812. So I was right in that. Debra Lowery, who was Indian, married W.R. Woodell, who was white.  WALTER WEARE: Your mother, Annabell, was, according to that geneology, what relation to Henry Berry Lowery?  ASA T. SPAULDING: It looks like here that Henry Berry Lowery was the son of Allen Lowery. Now here is where you need to tell me whether these are brothers of Henry Berry Lowery. I think they were. See that arrow pointing down here. They were brothers of Henry Berry Lowery, which means that Henry Berry Lowery was my mother&amp;#x0027;s uncle. If her father was his brother, he would be his uncle, or she would be his aunt.  WALTER WEARE: The Calvin Lowery referred to&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Wait. These are sisters of Calvin Lowery. So therefore, if Calvin Lowery was the brother of Henry Berry Lowery&amp;#x2014;see he has Henry Berry Lowery then he points down here to Henry Berry Lowery&amp;#x0027;s brothers. Isn&amp;#x0027;t that the way you interpret that?  WALTER WEARE: Yes. Then he has Calvin circled.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Because these are the sisters of Calvin.  WALTER WEARE: Maybe Calvin, though, is the father.  ASA T. SPAULDING: All of those would be brothers.  WALTER WEARE: Yes.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Maybe these are the family children of Calvin Lowery. These are sisters and these are brothers. These could be Calvin Lowery&amp;#x0027;s children.  WALTER WEARE: Which would made Henry Berry Lowery, then, your mother&amp;#x0027;s grandfather. No, no. It would make him uncle. Well, to kind of recapitulate this thing, the Robeson &amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: See here now. Here was Henry Berry Lowery. And he married Francis Pawley.  WALTER WEARE: You may have to wait.  ASA T. SPAULDING: For the book to come out, to go any further with this.  WALTER WEARE: It&amp;#x0027;s clear then that the Indian side descends out of this Lowery connection with land grants from the king of England. And that&amp;#x0027;s in Robeson County. And the other side of your ancestry, that&amp;#x0027;s clear not much before your grandfather.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Although they&amp;#x0027;ve traced it further back than that because I think John Andrew Spaulding that I told you about, I think he goes back beyond. Because his father and my father had the same father. John Wesley Spaulding married twice. My father was a son from his first wife. John Andrew&amp;#x0027;s father was a son by his second wife. And he&amp;#x0027;s the one who&amp;#x0027;s gone back and done all this research. So I&amp;#x0027;m sure, in trying to trace it, he would try to trace his grandfather, which would be my grandfather, too.  WALTER WEARE: You mentioned an L.L. Spaulding yesterday.  ASA T. SPAULDING: He&amp;#x0027;s the one who was supposed to be writing up the history of that whole community.  WALTER WEARE: But he&amp;#x0027;s long since died, I guess. Did he leave any papers, do you think?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s what I don&amp;#x0027;t know.  WALTER WEARE: Now where did he teach?  ASA T. SPAULDING: He was teaching at Biddle University, I think, when he died. See, after I left there in 1918, my knowledge of what was going on was limited. Because I was in school. You see, I came here. And during the summers I didn&amp;#x0027;t go back, because I worked at North Carolina Mutual while I was at National Training School. That was from 1924 on. From 1924 to 1932 I was in school. Except the time I was working at North Carolina Mutual, the two years I was out, from &amp;#x0027;25 to &amp;#x0027;27. So I lost my connection, I mean this follow-up. And then after I got here, with all the work I had at North Carolina Mutual those first five or six years. Coming in and trying to set up an actuary department and trying to do all the research and the records. My days, sometimes, ran from eight-thirty in the morning to twelve or one o&amp;#x0027;clock at night. And from January first until March the first, I would go to work at eight-thirty in the morning, would have lunch up there, would come home for dinner about six or seven o&amp;#x0027;clock, go right back up there, and work. I have worked as late as three o&amp;#x0027;clock in the morning. And come home and get mabe four hours of rest, eat breakfast, and be back up there at eight-thirty in the morning. That was from January the first until March the first when we were working on our annual statement. Because it was all done manually then. I had to crank out the reserves on all the insurance on a Freeden calculator. We did not have the computers. So I know what work means.  WALTER WEARE: This work ethic that we were talking about&amp;#x2014;we were talking about your father earlier&amp;#x2014;do you think that that comes from&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, the job required it. Under the law that statement had to filed in the insurance department on March the first. And there were no excuses. And there was a penalty. I think the penalty was fifty dollars a day for every day it was late.  WALTER WEARE: But you didn&amp;#x0027;t have to accept that challenge. Not everybody would have been that ambitious.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, the job required it, and if you were going to hold the job, you had to do it. Because if you couldn&amp;#x0027;t do it, somebody would have to. And after we got the original copy, we had to make copies for eight states and three or four copies for the office. And that had to be copied by hand. All of those schedules, all of the securities, all bonds had to be listed individually, all stocks, all mortgages, all real estate, all the different assets. That was all done by hand. So we had to get that statement out in time for copies to be made manually, to be filed in every state in which we operated by March first. I remember one Sunday, we met up there. Even the president was there. We had about thirteen copies. And each person had a copy of that statement. And we went line by line from the original, for them to check the figures.  WALTER WEARE: Should we read that will? Let&amp;#x0027;s do that.  ASA T. SPAULDING: You will probably be interested in excerpts from the will of James Lowery, which reads as follows: &quot;James Lowery died in 1811 and left the following will, which is recorded, Book of Wills Number One, page 121, Office the Clerk of Court, Robeson County, State of North Carolina, in the name of God, Amen.&quot; &quot;I, James Lowery, of the county and state aforesaid, though weak in body, yet of a perfect mind and memory, blest be God, do this thirteenth day of March, the year of our Lord, one thousand, eight hundred and ten, make this my last will and testament as follows: first I recommend my soul to Almighty God, and my body to the earth.&quot; This is marked #3 here, so it&amp;#x0027;s the third excerpt, I presume. &quot;First I give and bequeath to my loving wife the plantation I now live on, and the Negores Peter, Jake, Betty, Fanny-Bob, and all the land in my possession but one hundred twenty acres that my son lives on, and one hundred acres that my son, William, lives on. During her natural life, and after her death, to my son, James Lowery. I also give and bequeath to my son, William, the plantation he now lives at and all the cattles and hogs in his possession at this time. I also give and bequeath to my son, Thomas Lowery, one hundred and twenty acres of land that he now lives on. I also give and bequeath to my daughter, Mary, the Negroes Violet and Harry. I also give and bequeath to my daughter, Ceily, the Negroes Jenny and Beverly. I also desire that all the stock of cattle, hogs, harness and sheep remain on the premises and if either of my daughters marries during their mother&amp;#x0027;s life, to divide as she thinks proper. Signed, sealed and delivered at the presence of us.&quot; Signed James Lowery, and the &amp;#x0027;us&amp;#x0027; are the witnesses, W. MacNeil, and Neill MacNeil, and Bennett Locklear. And you will remember in this geneology here, that William Lowery married Betty Locklear. And the first intermarriage between the Lowerys and the Indians was by James Lowery Junior, who married Priscilla Barry.  WALTER WEARE: So, if this will is dated 1810, the Indian-White connection is well established and you have then these families who are mixed actually owning plantations and owning slaves. So that establishes that line, and the other line, as we said, is less clear. Back to your grandfather who was a landholder. And you&amp;#x0027;re not sure how he came into possession of his land.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. But the thing about it, it was not only he, but all the families that lived in the area there, that were landowners. All the Spauldings, the Moores, and the group that&amp;#x0027;s referred to in the noble ancestry here.  WALTER WEARE: Do you suspect that they were one-time slaves who were either emancipated?  ASA T. SPAULDING: All I know is that there were people there who reported never to have been slaves, and were referred to as free issue.  WALTER WEARE: They might have originally been servants?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I presume it means that they were born free. Some did buy their freedom later. But the earlier word that was passed down from hand to mouth, and different ones would be pointed out: &amp;#x2018;he&amp;#x0027;s a free issue.&amp;#x2019;  WALTER WEARE: Have you ever heard the tale that there may have been fugitive slaves who went to this interior area and then intermarried with Indians? The Indians provided a kind of refuge. This was true with the Seminoles in Florida.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, I haven&amp;#x0027;t heard of that in Robeson County. Because, as a matter of fact, so far as I know, my mother was the first woman from Robeson County that married outside. The intermarriages there, into Columbus County. She was the first woman of any of the Lowerys, or any of those from Robeson County to come into Columbus County. And her first husband was a Reverend Mack L. Moore, who was from Columbus County. He was a minister, and was often invited to preach in Robeson County.  WALTER WEARE: He would have been described as a colored man?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. As a matter of fact, he was very fair; he had very good quality of hair; and I&amp;#x0027;m sure he was of mixed blood with whites.  WALTER WEARE: And then she stayed in that area after her marriage.  ASA T. SPAULDING: See, she had two children by him&amp;#x2014;two daughters. And subsequently my father married her. And from that union came five children. Three boys and two girls. The first child was a daughter, the second was a son, my brother. Well, she was my sister, too. Of course, I was the third child. And then I had a brother and a sister following me.  WALTER WEARE: Did they stay in that area?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Only two of them stayed there.  WALTER WEARE: Are any of them living now?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. All but one is living. And that&amp;#x0027;s the younger brother. He died about four years ago, I guess it was. He was still there on the farm.  WALTER WEARE: They carried away, you think, the same values, or do you think you were exceptional among your brothers and sisters?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, all of them had values. My brother lives right up here in the next block. You can go by there and see his home. And he has a lot there with the most beautiful flowers. That&amp;#x0027;s his hobby, looking after those flowers. He worked for North Carolina Mutual from the time he came to Durham, until he retired. He retired as head of the printing department.  WALTER WEARE: We were talking about this distinction between Columbus County and race relations and Durham and race relations, particularly in connection with your father, who ran this hunting camp. Let&amp;#x0027;s recapitulate that. I think that&amp;#x0027;s interesting.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well my father had a lot of interests. He was a great hunter. He was enterprising. Because, in addition to farming and the principal crops&amp;#x2014;corn, tobacco, cotton, wheat, and of course peas, that were as cover crops as well as for gathering. From this the pea vines were cut and baled into hay for the feeding of the cattle. Some oats were planted also. And in addition to that, as a hobby, the aforementioned hunting. And in addition was that at one time, he and his half-brother, and his brother-in-law owned a sawmill together, later in life. But prior to that, he operated a general merchandisestore for the community. A community store. You could go there and buy clothes, cloth. A lot of the women did their own sewing, you know, and made what they wore. And he would order bolts of cloth from Wilmington, North Carolina. And he&amp;#x0027;d buy the flour by the barrels, sugar, all of the groceries, all of the staple foods. And it was a general merchandisestore. In other words, you could go there and get whatever you needed.  WALTER WEARE: Was this just a country store out in the rural area? Not in town?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, not in town. He was at the crossroads, coming from another section&amp;#x2014;I guess about seven miles. A crossroads between Whiteville, North Carolina on the Coastline, which was south of where we lived, and Rosindale, which was on the Seaboard Railroad. We had the Seaboard Railroad on one side and the Atlantic Coastal on the other. Whiteville, which was the county seat of Columbus County, was about nine miles from the intersection of these crossroads where we lived. And his store was on what would be the northwest corner of the intersection. It was between five and six miles from there to Rosindale, which was the Seaboard Coastal Railroad. Rosindale was the station stop where we would take around the&amp;#x2026;sell, getting a little ahead here. He also operated a turpentine still. North Carolina is a great turpentine state. The turpentine was distilled and converted into rosin. And of course the liquid spirits of turpentine that you would buy in grocery stores, and can still buy, was another by product that came from this distillery. And, in addition to that, he had tar kilns. Of course he&amp;#x0027;d get people to help build these kilns, usually from heart pine. The longleaf pines in particular. And it was a circular kind of a thing, like some of the mud huts that you find in these foreign countries. It was cut in sections of about eight feet, these logs. And these sections were split just like you split cord wood today. And they were laid around in a circular fashion. And there was a pit at the center of this kiln. So when the kiln was lighted and the wood would burn slowly, the tar from the pit in the center, and channels led it out. They&amp;#x0027;d gather it on the outside. And when you laid this wood in that fashion, and covered it with pine straw, and then covered that with dirt. So it would be a slow process of sweating the tar out of the wood. In fact, there was so much of that done in North Carolina at that time, it became known as the Tarheel State during the Civil War, I think it was.  WALTER WEARE: To whom would he sell all these products?  ASA T. SPAULDING: He would take it to Rosindale. I think that&amp;#x0027;s the reason that railraod station got its name, because it was a center for selling rosin. And shipping it to Wilmington. The merchant there would buy it, the rosin and turpentine, and ship it to Wilmington.  WALTER WEARE: Would many of the farmers in this colored community do the same thing? Would they have a turpentine business?  ASA T. SPAULDING: He was the only one who had the distillery for it.  WALTER WEARE: Would other farmers bring their products to him?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They&amp;#x0027;d bring it there. So with those different activities going on, I always had an interest in seeing how it was done, and being a part of it. Even though I was only five or six years when he started with that kind of thing.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  ASA T. SPAULDING: In addition to tar, there was another industry, the turpentine industry, in North Carolina, in which my father participated. And the process of gathering the turpentine, you would chip what you call chip boxes in the trees. What you did there was, you would cut a container into the tree cup-like, semi-circular on the outer rim, and, or course, in the form of container into the tree. And then at the beginning of that, you&amp;#x0027;d have what you call the chipper, where you&amp;#x0027;d chip the sap from the tree. The process is similar to the rubber plantations in Liberia today. Same principal in turpentine. And you&amp;#x0027;d have period, when you start that chipper, to go around weekly, and go up another section. And that turpentine would drain into that box that you had cut into the tree. And the collectors would come around with their buckets periodically. They knew just about how many days where that box would be filled. And would dip the turpentine out of the box and go on to another tree, and so forth.  WALTER WEARE: And you were actually doing some of that work yourself?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, I wasn&amp;#x0027;t old enough to do it then. But I saw it being processed, and converting it from turpentine into rosin.  WALTER WEARE: Was this a family interprise though, in which your brothers and sisters, or would you hire people?  ASA T. SPAULDING: There were hired hands that would go around and do the chipping.  WALTER WEARE: People from the community?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Uh huh.  WALTER WEARE: Would white persons work for him? Do you ever remember a white person working for him?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, white persons worked for us on the farm, chopping cotton and picking cotton. We all worked in the field together.  WALTER WEARE: And that would violate any&amp;#x2026;.?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, nobody thought anything about it. That&amp;#x0027;s why this matter of discrimination or segregation to me, coming up there&amp;#x2014;I just was not aware of it until just a little before I left there. When I mentioned that my father operated this restaurant out there at Elkton. When he first started, he didn&amp;#x0027;t have to have this dividing.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember when he started it?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I left there in 1918. I would say that he was operating it at least three or four years before I left there. I remember another thing, on Saturday nights. he&amp;#x0027;d go home, and he had one of these long pocketbooks that the money was kept in. And one of my jobs on Sunday morning was to count his money. Separate it into the pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters. Right on. And then the paper money. To get it in form for him to bank it on Monday.  WALTER WEARE: This restaurant. Was it a railroad stop?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. It was in Elkton, North Carolina, which was another railroad station between Clarkton and Rosindale.  WALTER WEARE: Did he own the land that that was on?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, I don&amp;#x0027;t think he did. He rented it.  WALTER WEARE: Now, when he began this, there was no segregation, even for dining.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Not that I recall. Because there wasn&amp;#x0027;t much dining. This was the first restaurant that I remember being opened for serving the public.  WALTER WEARE: But then you mentioned, as time passed.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I remember later there was this little divider between the section where the blacks ate and the whites ate. That developed just a little before I left. But it was such a thing. They could just look across it and see each other, you know. It was just something to separate. It was not even waist high.  WALTER WEARE: Before this, when these whites came to your father&amp;#x0027;s house on these hunting trips, would you eat together?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, we would eat together all the time. They&amp;#x0027;d come there and come right on in the kitchen. We&amp;#x0027;d all sit around the table together and think nothing about it.  WALTER WEARE: Would they tell stories to one another?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. And they&amp;#x0027;d each call each other by their first names. No differences were made.  WALTER WEARE: What about the &amp;#x2018;Mr.&amp;#x2019; and &amp;#x2018;Mr.&amp;#x2019; for the colored population? Was that withheld in that area?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They were called by first names. If your name was Armstead, it was Armstead, or if it was James, you were Jim. White or black across the line.  WALTER WEARE: You were talking about the &amp;#x2018;Mr.&amp;#x2019; and the &amp;#x2018;Mrs.&amp;#x2019; yesterday in North Carolina Mutual.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, well that was after I came to Durham. Naturally, you see, that was not the pattern in Durham. There was separation. They knew that the people living in the rural areas were called by first names. Just as I mentioned, in Columbus County, between my father and the whites that he dealt with, it was a first-name basis. And they were the people that I had come in contact with.  WALTER WEARE: So he could call whites by their first names.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Sure. Like Jim Elkins, or John Elkins, or Walter Porter. They were all by their first names: Walter, Jim, John, James.  WALTER WEARE: Politically: your father could vote?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: Was your mother politically active at all? Did she vote, do you recall?  ASA T. SPAULDING: She voted at times. But, you know, she was of a retiring nature. The Indian traits were reticence and retirement, not being very vocal, and being more introverted. Now, my father was an extrovert. My mother was an introvert. So I guess I&amp;#x0027;m somewhere in between.  WALTER WEARE: Did she stand out as different from the rest of the population?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, she had her good friends. But she was not a great conversationalist.  WALTER WEARE: But she could participate socially, with the quilt making and such?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. And then, after all, they didn&amp;#x0027;t have parties and things on the farms like they have in the cities. You worked six days a week and went to church on Sundays. What would happen: on the first Sunday, we would always have a dinner and invite our friends from the Rehoboth Church to have dinner with us. And usually most of them were Baptists. And we went to Sandy Plain, which was the Baptist Church, on the fourth Sunday. Some of them always invited us to their homes for dinner. And, of course, we would eat and sit around and spend the afternoon talking and discussing whatever community news there was, gossip, or whatever there was to discuss. So that was the type of social life we had. And we looked forward to going to church, not only for spiritual reasons, but for social reasons.  WALTER WEARE: The church was a social activity; this quilting that you mentioned; the hunting. What about games? Do you remember any games you played while you were growing up?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. We didn&amp;#x0027;t have games at that time. It hadn&amp;#x0027;t reached that point or that area. Except for baseball. Football hadn&amp;#x0027;t started, nor basketball. See, I was still talking about prior to 1918.  WALTER WEARE: Yes. So the evidences of segregation would have been in the schools. You went to an all-black school.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And I didn&amp;#x0027;t recognize, or it just never occurred to me that we had the black school there. It was a community school. It was located in the community for the people. And it just happened that all of them were black. So, you see, there wasn&amp;#x0027;t anything to cause me to think that this is a segregated school. It was a community school. Just like you talk about neighborhood schools? And the people in the neighborhood attended the school.  WALTER WEARE: And the church?  ASA T. SPAULDING: And the church. Now, as to whether or not there was feeling. See, kids, or the younger people, they don&amp;#x0027;t see that or recognize it unless their parents drill it into them. My parents had no reason to drill this into us, or to call it to our attention, because we socialized and ate together. What is more intimate amongst blacks and whites than to sit down and eat together? It&amp;#x0027;s taken us a long time, even in later life here, in the cities. When I came to Durham, I helped open the hotel here for blacks and whites to sit down together before the public accommodations proceedings were made.  WALTER WEARE: This was in the fifties?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. As a matter of fact, when I came back from Michigan in 1933, and shortly thereafter&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t remember what the year was, or whether this textile riot in Gastonia happened.  WALTER WEARE: 1929.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, this was while I was away in school, at NYU. But I knew about it, and the tensions that rose and what happened. And after I came back to Durham&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t recall whether it was a tobacco factory or a textile plant&amp;#x2014;they had this strike. And where the strike breakers were brought in.  WALTER WEARE: You&amp;#x0027;re speaking of Durham?  ASA T. SPAULDING: In Durham. And the situation was very tense.  WALTER WEARE: The strike breakers were black or white?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, if it was the textile industry, they were all white. And if it was the tobacco industry it was mixed, black and white. But I remember that I was very much concerned about it. While I was away in school, I would write articles for the Carolina Times.  WALTER WEARE: This was the black newspaper?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. Periodically something would strike me and I would write an article on it, dealing with it. So when I came back&amp;#x2014;after I finished and came back here&amp;#x2014;I started writing an article occasionally on something that was of interest, that had happened in the community and I had a reaction to. I&amp;#x0027;d write an article and send it as a letter to the editor. And it would be published. And I remember while this strike was going on, I think I made reference to what had happened in Gastonia, and whether or not we wanted it to happen in Durham, and that I thought that the leadership should try to take a stand in trying to bring about a more favorable climate, to settle it without resorting to violence. And I remember one of the letters called for community unity, to get it together. And it attracted a lot of attention. There were comments on it. So much so, that I took it upon myself to go to some of the leaders in the community. I went to a member of the city council, one of the outstanding white leaders. And I went to the editor of the local paper. I sat down and talked with him along the same lines. And I tried to get them to take the leadership in forming a committee. It didn&amp;#x0027;t matter with me whether it was a white committee or an interracial committee. But I thought that there ought to be a committee of the leaders to get together to discuss situations that were developing in Durham, and to provide leadership for the community. And I won&amp;#x0027;t call names because all of them are still living, and holding responsible positions, and well respected. And since I was talking with them privately, trying to get them to project leadership, they all agreed with me that something needed to be done. But no one was willing to assume the responsibility of calling the people together. They were afraid to be rebuffed.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think that was a genuine feeling, or do you think they were using that?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, they all agreed that it was not good for the community, what was happening, and problems that were coming up. And I took the position that if everybody is pulling together, it becomes easier for all, and progress can be made. Whereas, if you have a divided community and different ones are pulling in different directions, they offset each other, so, therefore, we stalemate. They bought my argument. But they were not motivated, whatever the reasons. And I won&amp;#x0027;t try to read their minds. But many of them said, &quot;I just don&amp;#x0027;t know whether I could get any followship.&quot; There could be something to that. Because, you know, when you&amp;#x0027;re staking out new ground, you can be left alone. And unless you can get some followship, you may lose some friends that you had before.  WALTER WEARE: Were they talking about other leaders or just about the white masses in general?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, we were talking about leaders. Because they were holding responsible positions in some of the businesses here, as well as public office and the publishing business.  WALTER WEARE: White and black leaders could apparently sit down and talk, but you couldn&amp;#x0027;t get much further than that?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. And then I think, as I began to gain stature, because of my being actuary of North Carolina Mutual&amp;#x2014;because, you see, the company has always been downtown from its very beginning. It&amp;#x0027;s the only city that I knew of that you could go in anywhere, and find a leading black business in the downtown, in the heart of the town. Because, the post office was just one-half block west of us; Main Street was one block south; and the leading bank was just right around the corner; and the courthouse was probably just a little over two, two-and-a-half blocks southeast. As a matter of fact, the hotel was just one-half block west.  WALTER WEARE: But there were certain things in that area that you couldn&amp;#x0027;t do.  ASA T. SPAULDING: But at the same time there were a lot of things we could do. You know, the dollar makes a difference. You take the stores. I remember shortly after I came back&amp;#x2014;the leading stores, the top stores&amp;#x2014;a black woman could go in there and buy a dress, but she couldn&amp;#x0027;t try it on. She could have an account. I mean if they felt it was good credit. But they would address their bills to them by their first names. And one of the first confrontations I had was with the leading women&amp;#x0027;s wear store. This was after I got married. I married in 1933. And my wife opened an account there. And I remember the first bill that they sent to her. It was sent to me. A.T. Spaulding. I sent it back and told them that evidently this was meant for Mrs. A.T. Spaulding, because I hadn&amp;#x0027;t made any purchases there. And if, and when, they sent it to Mrs. A.T. Spaulding, the bill would be paid. And they did it. And then others began to take that position. And they changed their practise. And then when that company did, others fell in line.  WALTER WEARE: Were there practises then that informally kind of fell away for people of your stature?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They made a difference. You take, for instance, the Pullman accommodations out of Durham. Blacks couldn&amp;#x0027;t get Pullman accomodations in the South at that time. But the top officers of North Carolina Mutual could. I remember when I got ready to go to New York University in 1927. I went down to the ticket office to get Pullman accommodations. And the ticket agent who had been selling Pullman accommodations to C.C. Spaulding, and Dr. Shepard here at the college, Mr. Ferguson. He was the ticket agent. He&amp;#x0027;s still living. Way up in age though. And he sold me Pullman, sold me a berth. And then his successor, Mr. Bobbitt, same thing. From that time on I was always able to get it. And I remember when I went on the train that night. It left here at seven o&amp;#x0027;clock, or five o&amp;#x0027;clock. I&amp;#x0027;ve forgotten which. But anyway, when I went on the Pullman car, before entering the car, I heard conversations, with the passengers on there. When I walked in through that door, it got so silent. I went on to my seat and sat down. And it was some time before somebody started talking with his seat-mate, or the person across the aisle. I paid no attention to it; I knew I had my seat and I was going to keep it [Laughter] ; I was going to bed that night  when the time came. And that&amp;#x0027;s what I did.  WALTER WEARE: So there was no overt action?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No overt action, just everybody ignoring me. And later it got to the place where conversations would start between the passengers and me. And especially after I became actuary of North Carolina Mutual. So I&amp;#x0027;ve seen these changes take place. And, you know, people are still afraid of anything that&amp;#x0027;s strange. If you don&amp;#x0027;t know about it, you&amp;#x0027;re uncertain, you know, and you just don&amp;#x0027;t know how. And I think that&amp;#x0027;s one of the curses of segregation and discrimination. It prevents people from coming to know each other. And I have found when people come together, they find a man is a man is a man is a man. As Gertrude Stein would say. Or a woman is a woman. And that the color of the skin has nothing to do with your ideals. You have some black grand rascals, and you have some white grand rascals, or scoundrels. And you have people of high ideals from all races. And the only way you can know, is by actual contact and conversation with the person. Just like I told you about those classmates of mine, that I had in Michigan. And once we came to know each other, we became fast friends. And I have found it as I have travelled around the world, or across this country. There isn&amp;#x0027;t a time, hardly, that I get on a plane today that I don&amp;#x0027;t either sit down beside someone that I don&amp;#x0027;t know, or someone I don&amp;#x0027;t know sits down beside me. And it&amp;#x0027;s only a few minutes before a conversation starts. And when it does, both of us are sorry when we get to our destination. Because, fortunately&amp;#x2014;and I hope this doesn&amp;#x0027;t sound that I&amp;#x0027;m bragging; it&amp;#x0027;s not that, but to make a point. When a person finds that you&amp;#x0027;re conversant on the things that are of interest, that you have ideas too, and you can back it up with some solid information and with experiences, whether it&amp;#x0027;s on local issues or national issues or international issues, that you can hold an intelligent conversation with him. And you just get started in a conversation, one thing goes on to another, just like our interviews here. And you find that everybody has experiences&amp;#x2014;there isn&amp;#x0027;t a person who doesn&amp;#x0027;t have some experiences&amp;#x2014;different from the experiences of somebody else. That&amp;#x0027;s the way we broaden our experiences. I remember one of the managers of our Philadelphia district years ago made this statement: When two people come together, each one may come with one idea. If they exchange those ideas with each other, when they go back, both are richer. Because each came with only one idea, which was his own. When they separate, they go away with two ideas&amp;#x2014;the one he brought and the one the other person brought. Then he has some comparisons that he can make.  WALTER WEARE: Was there evidence this early in Durham that you were having black leaders, yourself included, having this kind of impact on white leaders? That is, were they changing?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, when I succeeded C.C. Spaulding as trustee of Shaw University&amp;#x2014;and I don&amp;#x0027;t want to repeat something I&amp;#x0027;ve already said; I think I told you about&amp;#x2026;  WALTER WEARE: I think we missed the part that you&amp;#x0027;re getting up to.  ASA T. SPAULDING: All right. They would speak at eleven o&amp;#x0027;clock and have a question and answer period that would extend it to twelve. I would always bring that speaker to Durham for two purposes: one, to give him lunch at North Carolina Mutual, and second, to have community leaders to come in and meet him, and have him to talk to them on any subject he wanted. Because all of them were people who were leaders nationally, in business, commerce, industry, banking, or what have you. Or international leaders. Jumping ahead, I had, for instance, I remember when I had Francis I. Dupont to come here. And I wanted him to meet the community leaders. He was supposed to speak at eleven o&amp;#x0027;clock and his train came around eight or eight-thirty, I think. So, anyway, I called I guess about thirty of the leaders, black and white, in to meet him, probably at nine o&amp;#x0027;clock in the morning, in our directors&amp;#x0027; room. They came because this was one of the Duponts. I don&amp;#x0027;t need to elaborate on that. And to rub shouders with him, and to have him talk to them, and to be able to ask him questions. And I remember one of the things he said. Everytime they came out with a new product, they immediately, if they hadn&amp;#x0027;t already started their research before, on some product to replace the one that they&amp;#x0027;re just bringing out. Because they know their competitors are going to do it, and that&amp;#x0027;s the only way they can stay ahead. And they had products on the shelf, or formulas, to bring out at the appropriate time. Already going through the experiments and everything else. And those kinds of things are something to business people: think ahead, plan ahead, if you&amp;#x0027;re going to be competitive. And, you see, those kinds of ideas, people would come, who were doing things. They were glad to come. And the first time blacks and whites actually ate together: I started this. When I&amp;#x0027;d bring them here, I&amp;#x0027;d always have about eight or ten to meet with this person.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  ASA T. SPAULDING: I would select key white people to come and have lunch with the speaker and with the officers of our company. And, you know, I never had a refusal. They would come over here, and of course it was a private sitting, and they felt that they could come and not be exposed to the community. But that didn&amp;#x0027;t last long before I had a photographer to come in a take a picture of it, for our records, and our history [Laughter] . And I remember we had  an evening paper and a morning paper. The morning paper was a little more liberal. The evening paper was extremely conservative.  WALTER WEARE: The Herald is the morning paper, and the Sun is the evening paper?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. So I said, let me start with the morning paper. I had developed a kind of comraderieship, I guess you would call it at that stage of life, with the publisher, C.C. Council. And he was one of the early ones that I invited. And he came. And by that time, I had already started having a photographer come in and take a picture. And his photographer from his paper came in and took this picture of us at lunch. And it was run in the next morning paper. Well, you know what that meant.  WALTER WEARE: Now, who would be there? These are white Durham businessmen?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. The publisher of the Durham Morning Herald was amongst the guests at this luncheon with us and the speaker who had been to Shaw University. He was glad to come, because he wanted to meet this man and talk with him. And it&amp;#x0027;s just like today. People like to shake the hand of a celebrity. And I knew that. It went on so that I would have different ones. Then after this would come out that Mr. so-and-so was here, and these were the people who were at lunch, it got to the place where people wanted to be invited. I had no problem. I would always invite a different set of whites. Sometimes it was a lawyer and a banker. Well, you just go around the different representations of groups. Then after that, we would assemble in our directors&amp;#x0027; room, and I had a larger group&amp;#x2014;always about twenty-five or thirty people there, about equal distribution of blacks and whites. The black leaders in the different businesses and things they were doing. The publisher of the Carolina Times, the publisher of the Morning Herald, and all. In other words, I try to get all these counterparts. And in planning it, I would always arrange it with the speaker that he would be coming to Durham for luncheon after the talk at Shaw. And I would ask him if he would give about fifteen minutes talk to the community leaders. And they would all agree to it. And they would have a question and answer period afterwards. And those were the first forums between blacks and whites. Long before Duke started inviting the speakers that they&amp;#x0027;re inviting in now. And this was the forerunner of the exchange, the interchange of ideas between blacks and whites in Durham. That was North Carolina Mutual.  WALTER WEARE: When they were assembled there, would they forget about race, do you think?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I&amp;#x0027;m sure they were conscious of race, but at the same time&amp;#x2026;.  WALTER WEARE: Were they comfortable?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes, they were comfortable. And especially as it went along. It was always published in the paper. There were always pictures of the group that were made. And that&amp;#x0027;s why it was considered an honor to be invited. Because the speakers were of the calibre that you would want to have an opportunity to talk with them.  WALTER WEARE: Would you have to be careful about a seating arrangement?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. They just took their seats wherever they wanted. I&amp;#x0027;d always sit at the head table. Or, even before I became president, I&amp;#x0027;d have the chairman to sit at the head of the table, and the speaker on his right, and I&amp;#x0027;d be on his left.  WALTER WEARE: Did they ever confide in you personally after these experiences?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, sure! They thanked me for inviting them.  WALTER WEARE: But would they talk about the contradiction of one moment being togehter?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, no, I never made it a point to discuss the matter of that. It was a matter of an opportunity to come together and meet people, and hear what&amp;#x0027;s going on in the world, and what the current issues are, and what&amp;#x0027;s being done. How, if they&amp;#x0027;re at all being successful, what&amp;#x0027;s the secret of their success and so forth. Whatever they wanted to talk about.  WALTER WEARE: I was wondering if it had any psychological impact on race relations.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, sure it was having a psychological impact, because they were doing something freely and anxiously that they had never done before. So it had to. And when I first started, I was always very careful to select those who had shown some liberalism. And that was at a time when the Durham Sun, the editor of the Durham Sun, was down on Paris Street, and would write his editorials on the block vote, you know, and the Paris Street Gang, those kind of things, you know. I mean there were some very vitriolic editorials. So I bided my time. And I&amp;#x0027;d invite Mr. Council of the Herald to all of them. And I just was imagining that he was wondering if he was ever going to get an invitation. So, I don&amp;#x0027;t remember who the speaker was, but it was someone that I knew he&amp;#x0027;d be glad to meet. And he would be willing to sit down and eat with him. I thought he would; and I extended him an invitation. And, sure enough, he accepted it and came. And a picture was made of that [Laughter] . And after that we  became good friends. When I was appointed to City Board of Adjustment, the person who was chairman of the board at the time retired. I made the motion that he be made chairman. And he was surprised. I guess you call it, &amp;#x2018;door opening&amp;#x2019; or fashioning the key to unlock doors.  WALTER WEARE: Was there ever any reciprocity? Was it possible in this etiquette to be invited back?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, this was the forerunner of the next step, of making it a community-wide thing. In the early fifties, my pastor used to have what he called &amp;#x2018;Goodwill Day&amp;#x2019; and &amp;#x2018;Brotherhood Day&amp;#x2019;.  WALTER WEARE: This is Miles Mark Fisher?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. In February. So I suggested to him, whether or not he&amp;#x0027;d be interested in my getting (by that time I had formed these contacts, nationally and internationally and so forth) just a roster of people that I could extend invitations to and who would accept them. I remember shortly after Terry Sanford became governor, he was invited. He came over and spoke either at Brotherhood Day or Goodwill day&amp;#x2014;I forget which it was now. But even before then, I remember Irving Carlyle, a prominent lawyer in Winston-Salem. When the Supreme Court decision came down in 1954, and the governor of North Carolina took this opposition position, you know. And in Virginia, the resistence. And he had made a statement. He was the first white citizen in North Carolina to take an affirmative position on the Supreme Court decision. And I invited him here to be the speaker on one of these days. I&amp;#x0027;m going to let you read what he said.  WALTER WEARE: This is Sandford?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, this is Irving Carlyle. Before Sandford.  WALTER WEARE: It was following the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision outlawing segregated schools in public education, when many Southern governors and other state leaders were urging non-acceptance of the Supreme Court decision. And Mr. Spaulding invited attorney S. Carlyle, a partner in a prestigious law firm in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to be the Brotherhood Day speaker at White Rock Baptist Church. It was there that Mr. Carlyle said in part, &quot;The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on May 17, 1954, calling unconstitutional the compulsory segregation of the races in the public schools is one of the historic decisions handed down by that Court. On the pages of that Court&amp;#x0027;s epic decision, national destiny has been written, so that all could read and understand, whether they agreed or not.&quot; Mr. Carlyle continued, &quot;I have come to the conclusion that the decision is right and inevitable, and will be so regarded by history. Truth is on the side of the Court. The core of the truth is that all men are entitled to freedom through the compulsion of law, the power of religion, the abolition of racial discrimination in this country in due course is certain. And this will come about because law and religion operate irresistably on the conscience of men. In the 1960s Mr. Spaulding began interracial brotherhood and goodwill luncheons.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, that&amp;#x0027;s the main part I wanted you to read.  WALTER WEARE: So this is the step that led up to this.  ASA T. SPAULDING: You see what I was doing: I was working on different fronts. Trying to change the attitudes of people. I take this position, that if you can really change the heart or the attitude of a person, you&amp;#x0027;ve made a change in an individual. If you change conditions through force, for a long time, to keep it, you&amp;#x0027;ve got to do it by force. But if you can get people to change, you&amp;#x0027;ve really done something worthwhile. And I felt that to bring people together, and to let them come to know each other, and to know that human beings are human beings, aspirations, and common goal, and common objective, that all of us are interested in building a better city, and things of that nature, rather than fighting each other. Because, when you&amp;#x0027;re dividing and fighting each other, you&amp;#x0027;re hurting yourself as well as somebody else. So, with that thesis I would invite these people. I had the ambassador from Costa Rica, the ambassador from Nicaragua, I think, the ambassador from Nigeria, the ambassador from Guana, the person from India who was the first Asian Catholic, I believe, who was privy council to the pope, to speak here. What I would do is, after these people would speak at the church, I would have a reception for them here, and would invite a certain number to come by and meet and shake hands and converse. And, you know, sometimes you&amp;#x0027;d have a line almost half-way that block.  WALTER WEARE: Up the street?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Coming in here. Black and white. And then, after that, I took it to the hotel. Let me see, I think I have the first ambassador where we opened the Jack Tar Hotel, in 1964, before all these riots and things.  WALTER WEARE: That&amp;#x0027;s the year before the public accommodations.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right, before public accommodations. I want to show you that, and show you what that ambassador said at that luncheon, and who was a member. I set up a committee for brotherhood day luncheon. I went to see the manager and told him what I wanted to do. And before the hotel was opened, I had arranged with the manager for him to give him accommodations. And my pitch was that he was a foreigner, he was important to our international relations, and he&amp;#x0027;d be making a contribution by accommodating him. And the State Department would appreciate it, and so forth. Well, to make a long story short, he agreed to let us have it. And blacks had never eaten there, to say nothing about blacks and whites eating together. And I set up for that a committee, brotherhood day committee. The president of Duke University, Dr. Douglas Knight. I was the chairman, and he and the president of North Carolina College were vice-chairmen. And I had on the committee, the mayor of the city, the executive vice-president and president of the chamber of commerce, and a differet group there formed this committee to serve as hosts, and to sit on the dais at the luncheon. And had open invitation for anyone who wanted to buy the tickets for the luncheon. And we would have a hundred and fifty people there, black and white. And when this ambassador, Udochi [unclear] , of  Nigeria&amp;#x2014;it was 1964; wonderful talk&amp;#x2014;got through, Dr. Knight responded. And it was such an uplifting thing, and was such a significant thing, that everybody there just felt refreshed when it was all over. And I continued that until 1966, I think it was. So this was a forerunner of the softening up of the opening up of the public accommodations that followed later.  WALTER WEARE: To summarize: it began in the thirties when you came back and you were concerned about violence coming up. Was there violence here in the thirties?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, there were some strike breakers that were brought here at some of the strikes, and tensions were pretty high. I don&amp;#x0027;t remember that anyone was killed. But there was violence. So this is the first time this has ever been told, in the way that it is being told. But things were just done. Of course, news accounts of what happened were in the paper. And people came to know it. And I think that&amp;#x0027;s one of things for whatever respect I have been able to build in the community. These are the things that help contribute to it.  WALTER WEARE: Did any of this filter down, do you think?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, I&amp;#x0027;m sure it improved relations. Oh, yes, it improved relations. We wouldn&amp;#x0027;t have the blacks in public offices that we have today if it hadn&amp;#x0027;t been&amp;#x2026;things don&amp;#x0027;t just happen overnight, you know.  WALTER WEARE: Was this also part of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation? Was that their ideals?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They had one, but I don&amp;#x0027;t remember anything that they did that had a lasting effect, really. They had a lot of what they refer to as &amp;#x2018;do-gooders&amp;#x2019;. My approach was not to invite a few people, except to that luncheon thing, you know. The thirty or forty people who would meet in the directors&amp;#x0027; room to hear the person speak, the leaders in the community, to come if you want to and not if you don&amp;#x0027;t want to. But they always came.  WALTER WEARE: You gave them something attractive.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I had a magnet.  WALTER WEARE: It would appear then with North Carolina Mutual and the leaders, that whites did not see all blacks alike in Durham.  ASA T. SPAULDING: North Carolina Mutual has made a contribution to this city, state, and nation, that&amp;#x0027;s immeasurable. There&amp;#x0027;s no way you can measure it. Because of the leadership it has provided in all activities. You know, when they first organized the United Fund in Durham, blacks were excluded. They didn&amp;#x0027;t even solicit blacks. George Cox, who was agency director&amp;#x2014;you know that story.  WALTER WEARE: Go ahead, though.  ASA T. SPAULDING: All right. He got solicited all of the officers of North Carolina Mutual and some of the key people in the bank and things of that nature, and collected, I think it was seven hundred dollars. I don&amp;#x0027;t know what the amount was, but I think it was seven hundred dollars thereabouts. And they were having a hard time raising their goal. And he took it over to the office and laid it on the table. He said, &quot;Here&amp;#x0027;s a contribution.&quot; [interruption] From then on Negroes were  invited to participate in the United Fund campaigns.  ASA T. SPAULDING: The result was when the first mayor&amp;#x0027;s committee was appointed, I was appointed as a member. And when the committee met, I was elected as vice-chairman of the mayor&amp;#x0027;s committee, which I held until the&amp;#x2026; there was something that intervened; I don&amp;#x0027;t recall what it was now. But anyway, then I was appointed the first black member of the board of adjustment.  WALTER WEARE: This committee you&amp;#x0027;re speaking of, the mayor&amp;#x0027;s committee: what was the full title of the committee?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t recall if it was called &amp;#x2018;human relations&amp;#x2019; at that time: mayor&amp;#x0027;s committee on human relations.  WALTER WEARE: This was in the early sixties?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. I served thirteen years on the city board of zoning. But anyway, these things as a result of what I had done in these interracial matters, they considered me a natural for the mayor&amp;#x0027;s committee, for the early sixties. And I was still on that committee when we opened the public accommodations with Watts Hill&amp;#x0027;s assistance. He [unclear]  came in and was appointed a member, too. I believe Watts Carr ran for mayor, and I don&amp;#x0027;t recall whether was appointed and won, or not. I think that&amp;#x0027;s the way it was. And Watts Carr was&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t recall whether he had been appointed to the commission, and was on it, or whether [unclear] appointed him. But anyway, the question came up as  to whether or not he was going to stay on the committee, on the commission. And I told him one of the best ways, if he really wanted to make a contribution to the community and its pulling together, is not let your disappointment in losing your race prevent you from continuing to serve. That was a thing that changed his attitude and caused him to stay. I said, in so many words, between the lines, that not to do it would show that you are a little man; to do it would show your bigness. And that resulted in his continuing on. And then when Watts Hill came in, I remember we had the meeting and we were talking about it. And we saw what had happened in Alabama. I said now, &quot;Durham likes to call itself &amp;#x2018;the friendly city&amp;#x2019;. Do we want to put a premium on violence? Or do we want to be smart and provide leadership? If we keep on letting violence force us to do things, we&amp;#x0027;re putting a premium on it. Because people get to thinking that the only way you&amp;#x0027;re going to make any progress, or bring about change, is through violence. But if we want to be smart, we&amp;#x0027;ll take the leadership and bring about change without this having to happen.&quot; And we all bought it. Watts Hill, you know, once he decides to do anything, he rolls up his sleeves and goes at it. And, you see, he owned the hotel, he and his family. So he rolled up his sleeves. And he curses a lot, you know. He said, &quot;Goddammit, we can&amp;#x0027;t let these things happen here that happened in these other cities. We&amp;#x0027;ve got to straighten this thing out.&quot; And so we went to work on it. And within a matter of weeks, we had all the public accommodations open except the theatre. It was the last stronghold we had to break through. And we broke that through. So we prevented things happening here. And I don&amp;#x0027;t remember if it was before that or after that that I was appointed to the city board of adjustment. I told you about John Barry, and my nominating him to be chairman of the board of adjustment. But I don&amp;#x0027;t claim credit for the things that happened. But it&amp;#x0027;s like Abram Harriman said, &quot;It&amp;#x0027;s not given to any man to complete the things; but it&amp;#x0027;s given to every man to make a contribution.&quot; And this was a contribution that I was in a position to make. Both as being one of the major officers of North Carolina Mutual and the calibre of people I was able to bring into the community. And meeting together, and finding that they could come and we could sit down and talk together or eat together, and that the heavens wouldn&amp;#x0027;t fall. You know, if it&amp;#x0027;s something new, and you don&amp;#x0027;t know what&amp;#x0027;s going to happen. I remember when the Woolworth&amp;#x0027;s store decided to open its counter, they had all kinds of dire predictions that it would put them out of business. And that first week, when they opened them, and blacks went in there and started eating, they were really nervous. And I think they were sincere. I mean, I think they were afraid that they would lose their white customers. But they didn&amp;#x0027;t. Some may have stayed away, but gradually they came back, and nobody&amp;#x0027;s thought anything about it since. So sometimes all it requires is the courage of leadership to bring about change. And that was my great disappointment in my first effort that I made in going to the leaders.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  ASA T. SPAULDING: At that time, and in the community attitudes and all, the only person who could furnish any leadership, and get any followship, would be one of those persons that I contacted. Any my disappointment was that neither of them either had the courage or was willing to take that. And since that didn&amp;#x0027;t, I started using other methods, whatever came along. I told you the story about Moses and the Red Sea, you know, and God asked him, &quot;What&amp;#x0027;s that you have in your hand?&quot; And he said, &quot;A rod.&quot; And he said, &quot;Well use it, Moses. You have all you need to divide the Red Sea. Stretch it out over.&quot; So, I remembered that in every position I&amp;#x0027;ve been in, every opportunity. I looked upon my being there as something in my hand to use for the benefit of others. And when I succeeded C.C. Spaulding on the board of trustees, I felt I&amp;#x0027;m in a position, and I have a connection that I can use to bring people to here, to help open the windows of their minds, and the souls of these young people. To help see the outside world and breathe fresh air of the outside world. So, step by step, in every capacity.  WALTER WEARE: Did you ever encouter really rugged opposition?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Fortunately. And my approach, evidentally, has been such&amp;#x2014;and I&amp;#x0027;ve carefully thought the thing through. I would have to say&amp;#x2014;whatever the reason; I know not what; I guess the Lord is with me&amp;#x2014;the first time that I ate in the Jack Tar Hotel and took the matter up with the manager there was when I invited Lawrence Spivack to speak at Shaw. You remember him and his weekly program?  WALTER WEARE: The columnist, yes.  ASA T. SPAULDING: &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. I don&amp;#x0027;t remember how our connection developed, but it goes way back. But anyway, I invited him to speak at Shaw. This was in the early stages. And when he did, mayor Evans was the mayor at that time. He was Jewish. And I invited Spivack and his wife. His wife was with him. To come over and meet our mayor. And we went out to the mayor&amp;#x0027;s home and had nice conversation there. And I had arranged for a dinner that night with Spivack and his wife, mayor Evans and his wife, and my wife and me, in the Washington-Duke room. So that was the first time. And then the next time was when I started this brotherhood day thing, and went to see. But before that, though, I had arranged for an African to stop in the hotel. Well, I&amp;#x0027;m going from one thing to another. I guess it goes back to 1959, when Sehon [unclear]  Tour&amp;#x00E9; came here. You know that story so I don&amp;#x0027;t need to repeat it, with Hodges and all.  WALTER WEARE: I think it&amp;#x0027;s worth repeating.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And I was invited to the White House for the dinner, as I recall. Now, I may be getting a little mixed up. But this other part I&amp;#x0027;m sure of. The State Department contacted me to see about hosting him. And John Morrow, who was the ambassador, and formerly taught at North Carolina Central University, and he was the ambassador to Guinea. And the State Department was anxious. See, after Sehon Tour&amp;#x00E9; became president, the Russians wanted him to visit Russia. We wanted him to visit here. And everybody was going to determine which way he was going to lean by where he visited. Morrow was called upon because his brother was in the White House at that time, Fred Morrow. So, through that and the State Department, he agreed to come to Durham. Now, he had asked to go to Atlanta. So they were in a pickle. There was no way they could get the governor of Georgia to receive him. Well, they couldn&amp;#x0027;t stand for the head of state to be rejected by the governor of the state. So they got in touch with Hodges, who was our governor at that time. And Hodges agreed. While he didn&amp;#x0027;t receive him at the mansion, he arranged for him to stay at the Carolina Inn, and they would have the dinner that night at the Morehead Planetarium. We were invited there. There were two places they wanted him to visit: North Carolina Central University. Morrow was interested in that, who was the ambassador, because it was where he had left. And he wanted to visit North Carolina Mutual. Or they wanted him to visit North Carolina Mutual because of the position that it held&amp;#x2014;a black institution, largest Negro insurance company in the world, and all that. And that that would make some impression on him, what a minority is doing in this country, which is a democracy as against a communist country. So we agreed to serve as hosts. I had the mayor to present him with a key to the city, and it was quite an affair. Following that my wife and I were invited to the dinner over at Morehead Planetarium, and of course they had a luncheon for him over at Duke&amp;#x2014;Dr. Hollis Edena&amp;#x2014; we were invited out there. And so on. But as these African countries began to gain their independence, and they would send missions over here. Especially agricultural ones. They&amp;#x0027;d come to North Carolina A &amp; T University because of their interest in agricultural development in their respective countries. In every instance, they had the North Carolina Mutual on the agenda as places to visit. And we would entertain them. Mechanics &amp; Farmers Bank, Mutual Savings and Loan Association, North Carolina Mutual would have a luncheon. And I guess you saw him going through the whetstone with different groups. I was talking about what North Carolina Mutual has meant to our state and nation. And how you measure it in terms of goodwill. I don&amp;#x0027;t know how you measure it. And because of the respect that it had&amp;#x2014;I think I told you the story of how I got Hubert Humphrey here to be the commencement speaker.  WALTER WEARE: I think that&amp;#x0027;s worth putting on tape.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, if you already have it.  WALTER WEARE: Not on tape, we don&amp;#x0027;t have it.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, the first thing was our ground breaking. (Goes on to talk about ceremonies)  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is September 11, 1986, Ben Bulla in the office of Henry Jordan II who is owner and president of Coville, Inc., in Winston-Salem, N. C.  We will be discussing his dad, Dr. Henry W. Jordan, his Uncle B. Everett Jordan and other members of the Jordan family. HJ: ...and I don&#x27;t know where the guy lived or anything else. Somehow, Morganton sort of iumps into my mind, but I don&#x27;t know that. My father was born in Ramseur; Uncle Everett was born in Ramseur.  I don&#x27;t know where Aunt Lucy was born; she was older than they were. .,  --BB:  I have this somewhere in my notes. Well so much for that Henry, lets do this, let&#x27;s discuss your dad&#x27;s personality a bit. HJ:  O.K.  People loved him. They didthey did in Belmont and I think they did in Cedar Falls.  I know the highway department people did and all the politicians.  He also was uniquely a wise man.  I think of all the people I have ever known he had more wisdom than anybody.  He had the knack for learning a new job that he didn&#x27;t know beans about.  You stop and think:  He was trained as a dentist and practised for 20 years, he had a bad back and had the nerve to think that you could run a cotton mill sitting down, which is exactly what he said.  He said he could do that.  I know  that he toyed with the idea of buying that mill in McAdenville, but Uncel Everett wasn&#x27;t interested in doing that so they bought that mill in Cedar Falls from McCrary and moved down there.  I remember him reading books at night early in the war on the mechanical side of spinning.  I remember that.  Sometime later in my life we were walking through that cotton mill and he said after a while he learned to tell when it was running good.  He could sense it.  It&#x27;s just a matter of being, in there enough and being observant, and you could tell when  if  &gt;  .* ,: it was running well or when it wasn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t just a matter of ends down or something like that that you could look at and count. There was a sense to it. Then when he got into politics and road building; in 4 years when he was the Highway Commissioner under Cherry he learned enough about that thing that when Scott was elected he was the only commissioner . out of 10 that politically was for Scottthat he could run the whole highway department as commissioner.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever met anybody that could changewe&#x27;ll call it careersthat could change now, like he could.  Case in point.  When they, were in Scott was trying to get the the state to vote that $200,000,000 bond issue, which that was a lot of money in &#x27;49.  He went around to all these counties and made a pitch to peopleand I think 175 million was for roads and 25  million was for mental institutions and they were to finance it with It a gallon sales tax on gas.  That was the farmer-to-market roads, principally the secondary roads paving.  He had to figure some way to get people to vote to do that, and he persuaded people in every little town that they needed to do that and they wanted to get their roads paved.  Then it became sort of a questionpeople would think they were going to get more than they could.  If it was a total of 200 million and you have 100 counties&quot;that&#x27;s 2 million to the county.  Now you could pave a lot of roads for 2 million, and he had to explain that by the time you spread it over 4 years, which is what they intended to do, then you get down to one-half million a year per county if you just cut it on an average.- Then you got into this business where places like Charlotte were a lot bigger.  They said just imagine that if your daddy died and he had a lot of money, and you had 20 brothers and  sisters you wouldn&#x27;t get such a pig piece, and he said that people sort of backed off.  They were thinking they were going to pave every dirt road that they could find.  But he was that way.  He could take an idea and get it down into a very simple thing that wasn&#x27;t very hard for anybody to understand what -it was about.  Then they would do what he wanted.  He had that sort of success. One of the stories I rememberthey were trying to get ferries to go from the coast out to the outer banks.  The war had been over for a while and somebody thought--why couldn&#x27;t they get some of these moth-balled navy landing craft and turn them into ferries.  So they inquired from the Department of the Navy and their answer was that we might have another waryou never can telland we&#x27;ve got a thousand in moth balls, but we can&#x27;t let 5 of them go.  Now he thought there was a better answer.   Hoey was a senator then and he had known  Hoey from his days of&quot;politicking&quot;in Gaston county, and so he got in touch with Hoey and told him what he wanted and Hoey said he didn&#x27;t know an admiral that would turn them loose.  Finally Hoey said that he had an appointment with the President, and he said he would ask him if he would talk to him, and so fortunately Hoey called back and said, &quot;If you&#x27;ll come to Washington on a certain day, I&#x27;ve got an appointment with Mr. Truman, and we&#x27;ll talk with him.&quot;  Truman was a great believer in using what you had.  When the war was going on and they allocated all the supplies he was active in the senate committee that he was onso:anyway, they went to see President Truman and Truman was interested in the idea that here was a way to do something with something that was sitting around, and so Truman told my father--.the&#x27;y liked each otherthat there was bound to be a way that we can find 5 or 10 of these boats that you can H. Jordan II v* 4 us fellow Averjt-i Harriman died.  You know? get your hands on.  He said that just makes sense.  Then Truman asked my father, &quot;Do you have any children?&quot; and my father told him he had three.  So Truman told him, &quot;Here take some of these matchbooks. some  ,.&#x27;.&quot;.;&#x27; Children love to have things like that.&quot;  So he gave him/for us and will my father said, &quot;You know a man that/think enough about the other fellows familythat does that, is all right.&quot; So he and Truman got to be buddies.  They didn&#x27;t call each other all the time but they liked each other and they knew who the other guy was, and so they got the landing craft or whatever kind of craft it was and converted them into ferries and they ran back and forth down there until they wore out.  But he was good at getting something like that done.  There&#x27;s sort of a sequal to that: Within the last month th: Well when Truman&#x27;s term was nearing an end and the Democratic primaries were taking placeTruman couldn&#x27;t succeed himself--congress had passed a law that he could not succeed himselfand he was interested in who was going to be the next president.  I think most presidents and most governors are. , And he called my father one day, and he said, &quot;I want to talk with you about a fellow&quot; and he said, &quot;As you know a lot of people are interested in the job,&quot; and he said that,&#x27;bne of them, I think, _has-the,-&quot;  T ability, and I&#x27;d like to see him have a chance to get at this thing, and he doesn&#x27;t know anybody in North Carolina to speak of, and he is from New YOrk, but he&#x27;d, like to-.talk to someone,&quot; and Mr. Truman was of the opinion that my father understood N. C. politics very well, so they made arrangements for Averi]j Harriman, who was the governor of New York at the time, to. come, down to N. C. and talk about  our state. Harriman was a big, tall man.  He was every erect in his carriage.  He   &#x27; r   f,    H. Jordan II                                              5 ]ust looked very imposing.  He was a big man physically.  He was worth an enormous amount of money from out of those railroad fortunes, and he had the situationor the pretext wasor the convenience washe was going to make the talk at the Asheboro Rotary Club.  That was what he was invited to come do, and he wanted to know if a man from N. Y. could carry N. C., and more to the pointand this must have been in the early 50&#x27;sTruman&#x27;s elected term was &#x27;48 to &#x27;52 so let&#x27;s just say it was &#x27;51.  Truman had been active in the early Civil Rights legislation which made some of the people from the South uncomfortable, and Harriman had been very active in that and-he had said that he believed that the equality of the races needed to be balanced.  So one of the questions to my-father was, &quot;Can I get elected in N. C  North Carolina may be as typical of the South or not/&#x27;  Now remember he came inwe never used the living roombut that&#x27;s where they went to, because you couldn&#x27;t really walk&#x27; through there accidentally.  So Mr. Harriman and my father went in there and talked all afternoon.  I believe Harriman left, I don&#x27;t think he stayed for supperbut the conversation went something like this.  First they wanted to get to know each other, becuase Harriman wanted my father to support him and they talked about various things.  Harriman was a Democratic Governor with a Republican legislature and they talked about the ins and outs. How do you persuade a legislature that&#x27;s dominated by the other party to do what you want them to do.  Harriman was telling him that one time he was for something, but it was better not to say so, in fact, to intimate that he was opposed to it and get the pot boiling and see if the legislature wouldn&#x27;t pass the thing anyway.  And the story that he told my father was that they did.  Then he said, &quot;You know H. Jordan II                                              6 you can&#x27;t brag about that.&quot;  I sort of have a memory of him laughing a lot.  I don&#x27;t have any idea that they talked about the Russians because Harriman had been an ambassador to Russia.  But when they came to the question, &#x27;Could Harriman get elected in the South?&#x27; my father said, &quot;Now listen, let me tell you about this.  When Mr. Truman was running in &#x27;48 there weren&#x27;t that many T. V. stations or sets in our area; now there are, and the difference it makes is that Truman could take a very strong stance about equal rights in a speech in N. Y. that was reported in the New York Times and it got scant attention in N. C.  By the same token he could come to N. C. or S. C. or anywhere in the South and make a speech that was not really so strong for civil rights, but was more attuned to what he thought his audience wanted here, then it got scant publicity in the N. Y. Times.  Now, given the fact that T. V. is a more national sort of . -.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   - media what you say in N. Y. Is on the -6 o&#x27;clock news in Greensboro. You no longer have that luxury., if you want to call it that, of having separate-stands.&quot; And he said to Harriman, &quot;Whatever you believe, you&#x27;re going to have to stick with because you can&#x27;t hide anymore.&quot; And he said, &quot;What do you believe?&quot;  Harriman said, &quot;I believe that things need to be equal.&quot;  And my father said, &quot;0. K., I&#x27;ll help you.&quot; And he did.  Harriman ultimately did not get nominated, he just didn&#x27;t have the charisma that Adalai Stevenson did.  But it was sort of curious to meI thought about this when Harriman died recentlywhen I saw the obituarythat it&#x27;s a sort of wonderful part of this countrythat with the help of a guy as rich and asa political figure could/a couple of friends get to know a guy in Cedar Falls population of 400, and come down H. Jordan II                                         ^7 there and get good advice.  But he did... And I don&#x27;t know that they ever had any ongoing conversations similar to the way Truman and my father did.  Truman., parenthetically,, liked Scott a great deal, and at one point if he had run again Scott was one of the people he thought would make an interesting vice presidential candidate.  Then the law was passed that he couldn&#x27;t succeed himself and it became not an issue. But Scott is sort of an interesting part of the storyyou know a lot of that but-* BB:  No, I don&#x27;t know. HJ:  What I was going to tell you about Scott was I was 13 or 14 when that primary took place and I was interested and I read the papers and it was just interesting to me.  It seemed like that whoever was running for governor always came to the house in Cedar Falls, came through the back door and talked.  I remember Cherry in &#x27;44 or &#x27;43. He was a big, husky guy.  He&quot;came and they talked and Cherry got elected, and then when Scott came along Scott was the rebel in the organization.  He was the Secretary of Agriculture of North Carolina; Mrs. Scott was a 2nd cousin of papa&#x27;s, and the main thing that attracted my father to Scott was he thought the other guy shouldn&#x27;t , be elected governor and he had very specific reasons for that.  He just didn&#x27;t think the other guy told the truth. BB:  That was Charlie Johnson HJ:  Charlie Johnson, he was the treasurer.  But Johnson was favored by an overwhelming majority of political people at the time and Scott got my father and Uncle Everett and 8 other people, a total of 10, to talk to him about whether he could or ought to run. BB:  Do you know any of the other eight names?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .....                                                                                                                              .:.&#x27;.&#x27;&#x27;       &#x27; -  -H. Jordan II                                               8 HJ:  I don&#x27;t; I don&#x27;t have any idea.  But they said, &quot;run, and we&#x27;ll help you.&quot;  I don&#x27;t think they had a lot of money, and I don&#x27;t remember much about that campaign except at the end of the first primary Scott came in second, Johnson was comfortably ahead.  Main Albright was the number three guy and he had a bus and he drove all around the state talking about people.  He had been in the service and he was a lawyer in Raleigh, and a nice fellow.  I had met himhe&#x27;s dead now, but he pulled in enough votesI don&#x27;t remember who the fourth guy wasbut you had that run off, and I don&#x27;t have any insight into what got Scott votes in the 2nd primary.  I&#x27;m pretty sure Albright said he was going to be neutral, but apparently most of the people who were for Albright switched to Scott; I don&#x27;t know.  I do remember that Scott won and at the next meeting of the Highway CommissionSandy Graham the chairman had been for Johnson and these 9 other commissioners had been for Johnson and Scott told them that their days were numbered by the including the chairman calendar.  My father was the only member of that commission/that knew anything about the system, and so Scott asked him to be the next chairman.  Then they put together this, commission, and one of the interesting things aboutI remember some of those people; they were .-  not necessarily rich people nor were they industrial people.  One guy was from Iron Station, one guy was from down around Candor, and part of the picking process was to get people who really did know the people, because that&#x27;s where they wanted to spend their money.  They didn&#x27;t want to build a lot of primary roads, they wanted to pave the secondary roads.  A lady who was secretary&#x27;&quot; for the chairmanI don&#x27;t remember her name nowbeen there a long timewhen my father came in . &#x27;&quot; .. .... . H. Jordan II                                              9 she liked him a great deal and she told me this story one time.  She said that the first meeting of the&quot; new highway commission everybody was very happy and they were talking about spending $175 million extra bucks and all this and so my father opened the meeting and they sort of went along for a while talking and they were still sort of on a high.  Everybody was happy, and he sort of let them talk their way through that and then when they were sort of catching their breath he said, &quot;Now let me explain one thing to you.  None of you guys have ever done anything like this and I have, and I&#x27;ve got one early message for you.  Don&#x27;t let any cheating go on.  I&#x27;ve been at it long enough to smell it learn how to do that, because when our 4 years are over I don&#x27;t want any criticism about what we did with all this money.&quot; He said, &quot;just get started thinking about it now.&quot;  Then the meeting got into  what they were going to do and how they were going to go about it.  But he was that way, and he was wise.  Now he could have said that at the first of the meeting and it would have been forgotten, but he let them get all the celebrating of their system then he got down to that.  He was pleased at the end of his system; he didn&#x27;t have any newspaper stories about so-and-so had done this and etc.  He was proud of that. While Scott was governorthis is just sort of an anecdoteas you know he had a real sense of humor and he put it to use.  He was eating breakfast with Scott one morning and the Senator had diedI don&#x27;t remember who it wasand there had been a lot of speculation about who the new senator was going to be. BB:  It was probably Willis Smith.(that died).   \%- &gt; - -   &#x27;-.- - ,::;.:&#x27;.. &#x27;-. H. Jordan II                                              10 HJ:  It could have been.  Scott took forever to nominate somebody. He told my father that if he did it right away there may be two or three people that think they should get the job and all but one are going to be disappointed.  And he said that if he took a little more time, and everytime somebody asks me who I am going to appoint I&#x27;ll say, &quot;Well a lot of people are recommending so-and-so.  If I get enough names out there none of them think they got a very good chance and so they won&#x27;t be mad at me if they don&#x27;t get the job.  So that morning at breakfast Scott said, &quot;Henry, I&#x27;m going to announce today who I&#x27;m going to appoint to this senatorial seat.  I&#x27;ll bet you a nickel you can&#x27;t guess who it is.&quot;  And papa said, &quot;Kerr, for a nickel you&#x27;d change your mind I&quot; Scott appointed Frank Graham and my father said that that appointment ultimately got Scott elected to the senate; and he said that Scott never could carry Mecklinburg County and try as they had in both of those counties they lost Mecklinburg big.  He said for some reason Frank Graham was a real hero who acted in politics--just the group in Mecklinburg County, and they decided that Scott was all right.  And of course years later when Scott ran, that Mecklinburg just was not a problem for Scott.  I don&#x27;t remember how many times he ran, but it&#x27;s a pretty good illustration of the politics side of papa, because he would remember something like that.  He was just a master at making the pieces fit together.  I don&#x27;t ever remember an organization that he was involved in that stayed at war with itself. . It just didn&#x27;t happen.  And it wasn&#x27;t that he couldn&#x27;t say noI really think he was one of the best people I ever saw at saying no.  He had a good way to H. Jordan II                                        .  11 V  do it, and I&#x27;ve thought partly it could have been acquired.  By a practice in dentistry.  Most of the&#x27; time the dentist has to give you some bad news--that tooth has to come out.  And you know it isn&#x27;t going to be completely painless, but he has to say it so that you don&#x27;t jump up and run, but also so that you aren&#x27;t scared to death. And there&#x27;s a real knack to saying something real bad is going to happen and it&#x27;s going to be all right later on.  You know what I&#x27;m thinking, and he was good at that..  I&#x27;ve seen him time and time again and he didn&#x27;t mealy mouth about the thing BB:  Could you give me an illustration? HJ:  I&#x27;m trying to think of one.  Yes.  One time at Ramseur Interlock we were having a board of director&#x27;s meeting and Sam Rankin wanted to do something and it didn&#x27;t suit my father at all, and so Sam ran through the thing and explained what his idea was and why he wanted to do it and he said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that right?&quot;  And my father said, &quot;Nope, but it sounds good doesn&#x27;t it.&quot;  That&#x27;s a pretty good illustration.  I&#x27;ll give you another one.  .. One time Scott wanted to do something in the highway system and he told the reporters this was going to happen and apparently they knew that this was not what my father had in mind and so they came around to see him and they said that they understood that the governor has said that such-and-such is going to happen and we didn&#x27;t think that was what you wanted to do, is that really going to happen?  And he said, &quot;Nope.&quot;  and they said, &quot;Why not?&quot;  He said, &quot;Because it&#x27;s my highway department.  Kerr Scott runs the state.&quot;  And he said, &quot;That isn&#x27;t going to work and I won&#x27;t have any problem explaining to the governor why we can&#x27;t do that.&quot; But he said it didn&#x27;t work that way.  : .H. Jordan II                                              12 He was a direct person, but he rarely made people mad with the way he went about it.  I think the way he talked to Harriman is a pretty good answer there. BB:  Henry, this is very good.  These anecdotes and illustrations are what I&#x27;ve been looking for and could not find.  You&#x27;ve been most helpful.  If you have some more, feel free. HJ:  One of the anecdotes that I do rememberyou asked me about the familyMy grandfather must have been a marvelous manand his wife. The four of the brothers were down at Duke one day for something possibly a football gameand I don&#x27;t know that I have ever known a I don&#x27;t know anybody at Duke minister that was as loved as Uncle Frank, and/the whole four years that I was at Duke, that just sort of lived that university and was also beloved like Uncle Charlie, and my father was beloved.  Uncle Everett was more respected than loved, because he didn&#x27;t have that knack for thinking about the other fellow first.  He just was not built that way.  They were talking to somebody who came walking up &#x27;&quot;v - that didn&#x27;t know Uncle Frank and Uncle Charlie and so my father introduced them and he said, &quot;These people represent the better element in the family.&quot;  Then they talked a little bit and that person walked away.  And Uncle Everett said, &quot;Henry, you and your damn sense of humor!&quot;  He didn&#x27;t appreciate not being included in the better element. You know what I&#x27;m talking about. I do remember this thing about Uncle Everett.  When I was 13 he happened to be in Cedar Falls on that day for lunch at our houseor it may have been supperit was in Novemberbut at the end of the meal he gave me 13 silver dollars, which I still have, for a birthday present.  Ithanked him and I said, &quot;Uncle Everett, I want to give you  -. &quot;   &#x27; ;   -  &quot;&#x27;- &#x27;  &quot; &#x27; &#x27;   &#x27;: &#x27; &#x27; , : ..&#x27;- &#x27; &#x27; -&#x27; ;H. Jordan II                                              13 an invitation now for next year when I&#x27;ll be 14.&quot; He said, &quot;I won&#x27;t be back&#x27;.&#x27; because he didn&#x27;t want to get into a precedent that every year he had to give me my age in silver dollars.  And he said, &quot;I won&#x27;t be back.&quot;  But it was thoughtful and somehow he had known ahead of time that it was my birthday and he brought those silver dollars over. I&#x27;m trying to think of other things BenI think Uncle Everett was a hard man. &#x27;He was a demanding person and he wanted his way first and that was about the only way that made him happy.  I think Aunt Katherine was a real source of balance for him.  I think he listened to her regularly.  If she said, &quot;Ithink you need to do something&quot; he would he would change his mind for her, and I don&#x27;t think he changed his mind for many other people.  Right, wrong or indifferent-he just didn&#x27;t like toone story comes to mindand I didn&#x27;t know the ins and outs of his and Kerr Scott&#x27;s falling out, but if you remember Scott appointed Uncle Everett Chairman of the Democratic Party after he became governor, but they didn&#x27;t get along. BB:  What happened? HJ: I don&#x27;t know. My surmise is that both.,of them were such strong personalities that neither one could figure why the other one wanted to do something different, and ultimately Scott prevailed because he was the elected official. It sort of brings to mind this story a navy captain I used to have told.  His name was George Pierce and he came from Greensboro and he was the very senior captain when I worked for him., He was the best Naval officer I ever saw, and he almost got hit one day.. We were on an ammunition ship, and that&#x27;s fatal.  And he sent a statement to the other captainand it&#x27;s an old navy story&quot;I suggest you try another -H. Jordan                                                     14 ocean, this one is not big enough for the both of us.&quot;  So I think the Democratic Party in North Carolina just was not big enough for both of them, and I don&#x27;t know any more about it than that, but I expect that was the case.    ,- BB:  Did you ever hear your dad comment on that? HJ:  I didn&#x27;t.  He had a certain policyhe said, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell children anything of that nature, because someone would try to worm it out of them and children are too innocent to know when they are getting beguiled. The simplest thing is to tell them nothing about the ins and outs.&quot; I don&#x27;t whether he asked us not to tell who was coming in the back door when these guys were running for governor, I really don&#x27;t know, but it was no secret who he was for, that wasn&#x27;t the problem, but when it got to the ins and outs of who was doing what he didn&#x27;t broadcast that.  I do think thisI&#x27;m jumping nowthat Uncle Everett was probably one of the better senators that we had.  You know he did change in that job.  I think Bill Cochrane was influential in that change, but one illustration:  The Cooper-Church amendment was the first real evidence in the congress that they were opposed to the Viet Nam War conduct, and the presumption was that people would hold it against the senators if they favored Cooper-Churchconservative peopleNorth Carolina people to be exact.  And I do know that Uncle Everett slowly but surely decided to vote for Cooper-Church and he expected to be criticized, and he was plesantly surprised when the criticism wasfor exampleone out of three, and that two out of the three people that talked to him or his office and said this is what I thinktwo out of three people were in favor of what he had done, and I think it is one of the few actual instances that I recall where he took an unselfish H. Jordan II                                            15 -&#x27; ,   &#x27; -&quot;    . r-,f &#x27;.v. .,., . ,/&#x27;. stand where he thought he would be criticized.  And I think Bill Cochrane had something to do with that, but Uncle Everett was willing to make that change.  I think he tookin the end--a lot of pride in ;  &#x27;    \        i being a good senator just for the record, not for personal gain anymore because he was pretty well passed that in,terms of age and in terms of wealth.  That was not a new goal to achieve.  He was a good senator.  One of the things that papa did talk to me about was the Bobby Baker case. When Kennedy was nominated he was not very popular in N. C. Hodges and if I remember it EXKEKKB had sort of jumped the boat and gotten on the Kennedy band wagon and sort of wanted to get a job, but he couldn&#x27;t persuade people to jump with him, and there was a lot of talk in the papers about the fact it appeared that Kennedy would not carry N. C.  So ultimately the party came to my father and said, &quot;Would you run Kennedy&#x27;s campaign in N. C.  You&#x27;re the only man that can bring the factions together.&quot; He didn&#x27;t know Kennedy; he had never really gotten anybody elected that he didn&#x27;t know and what he stood for, but he believed in the Democratic party and he said that he would.I asked him one time why he believed in the Democratic Party and he said, &quot;When I was a young man growing up I observed that they cared more for the ordinary fellow than the Republicans did.&quot;  And he was growing up in the early 1900&#x27;s, and he said that&#x27;s why he was a Democrat.. He was sort of put to the test on this business because he just didn&#x27;t ordinarily work for somebody that he didn&#x27;t know and approve and he didn&#x27;t know Kennedy, but he agreed to do it and Kennedy got H. Jordan II                                            16 &quot;&#x27; elected in N. C. BB:  Was your father campaign manager for N. C.? HJ:  Yes. And he ran itwhat he didhe was so well respected, and he knew people all over the state and they knew him.  He would go to them and explain why he was supporting Kennedy and I don&#x27;t know what the arguments were, but he would just ask them to help him out.  It sounds too simple, but it always workedand I&#x27;ll digress one more minute.  I have a faint recollection of Broughton running for governor-just faintI remember Cherry very well.  Cherry was Grandmother Rankin&#x27;s Lawyer and he had known Cherry for some time.  I remember Scott very well and then the rest of them that followed.  He never supported someone he didn&#x27;t like; it didn&#x27;t matter whether they were ahead at the time or not, and if he supported them, they won.  Take Scott as an example.  Scott was an underdog in the grandest sense, and Scott won.  A few years later, Dan Moore was a terrific underdog and won. I&#x27;ll tell you that story later on,but he always was able to get people to support what he was working for.  Part of it was picking who he was going to work for, but it didn&#x27;t matter if the guy wasn&#x27;t ahead because he took a Scott and he took a Dan Moore and they weren&#x27;t even close to being evenback to Bobby Baker. Baker came about because the Kennedys wanted to get rid of Lyndon Johnson.  Johnson wasn&#x27;t their choice as a vice-president in fact they thought he would turn them down when they offered it to him.  It&#x27;s like asking the wrong girl to marry youthere you are, you can&#x27;t divorce her, she needs to quit.  So Baker arose out of that.  They were trying to embarass Lyndon Johnson so that he couldn&#x27;t be on the H. Jordan II                                            17 ... ticket the second time around.  That was what Uncle Everett was of the opinion, and that&#x27;s, one of the reasons the Baker thing was handled the way it was.  If they had had a different head of that committee then you could just as well have had a lynching party as not. BB:  Would it have been another Watergate?  ,! , HJ:  No I don&#x27;t think so.  I think Uncle Everett was convinced that Johnson had nothing to do with what Baker had made out of vending machines or whatever, and I don&#x27;t believe there Was any question in his mind that Baker should have gone to jail and the dividing line was the fact that it shouldn&#x27;t be an embarassment to Johnson, because Johnson was not behind it.   The irony of the thing was, of course by the time it got to its fruition Mr. Kennedy had been assassinated and Mr. Johnson was the president so that being the case the same guys that were pushing to crucify Baker rather than simply just putting him in jail were very well satisfied that he was going to get put into jail. BB:  Well Henry some folks have said, quite frankly, that Everett Jordan&#x27;s handling of the Bobby Baker casethe investigationwas a whitewash. .. HJ:  All I really know is just what I have said.  I don&#x27;t think that was the case but I don&#x27;t know anymore than I&#x27;ve told you. BB:  You don&#x27;t think that Johnson himself was any more involved than the investigation showed? HJ:  I do not.  I do not. BB:  Was Baker accused of influence peddling also? HJ:  I don&#x27;t remember Ben, he could have been.  I don&#x27;t remember. . - H. Jordan II                                            18 Here&#x27;s another story about Mr. Johnson and Everett that is probable not so well known. .                                                                    j BB:  On this Baker case, did you ever hear your dad comment^the handling of that investigation? HJ:  No I did not.  That was not typically what he cared about.  I&#x27;m sure he and Uncle Everett talked about it, because I think Uncle Everett did ask his advice, but itit was his opinion rather than his advice.  I think.  They talked a lot. The story that I do want to tell you about Uncle Everett and Mr. Johnson goes back earlier.  This was when Johnson was the majority leader and had announced he had wanted to enact some civil rights legislation, and the senate wasand I think it was the Southern elementunwilling to let it get to the floor.  So the task was really for Johnson to get it on the floor.  Once the amendment was on the floor it was gonna get passed, and as you know the senators take turns presiding over the Senate and it&#x27;s a routine sort of job.  That&#x27;s when the Vice President is not there.  Mr. Johnson came by to see Uncle Everett and he said, &quot;In a few days it&#x27;s going to be your turn to preside and I would like to get the floor.  I don&#x27;t need to tell you what I&#x27;m going to do with the floor, but I can promise you that if you let me have the floor it&#x27;s not going to ruin your senate career, and it&#x27;s not going to put you in such an embarassing light with your constituents t^t&#x27; they .would refuse to reelect you.&quot;  You know Uncle Everett was a guy that did count his pennies and his votes, &#x27; -                       /&#x27;    &#x27; &quot;I&#x27;: -&#x27;&#x27; - and he made the decision tovlet Johnson have-.the floor when he asked for it.  And so the appointed day and hour arrived; Johnson asked for H. Jordan III                                          19 the floor and he got it, and he got his amendment out on the floor and it was passed, and this became the Civil Rights Act or whatever. And Johnson was right in saying that Uncle Everett was not going to lose all of his friends in the senate nor in N. C. because people had pretty much decided that it was going to happen and it was a little bit like Scott&#x27;s idea; if you waited long enough then nobody is going to get mad because it was just a matter of time at that point, and I suppose that was Johnson&#x27;s logic, but anyway he never had a backlash that I know of for doing that.  And no one particularly made note that it was Jordan of N. C. that let Johnson have the floor, but Johnson never forgot it and that&#x27;a how Uncle Everett got to be Chairman of the Rules Committee.  Johnson wanted to make things even for Uncle Everett taking the risk.  The risk is the thing, and that&#x27;s where you have to have a decent amount of faith.  Faith, hope and a little charity that it happens around.  But that&#x27;s true, and concievably that colored his thinking about Baker and Johnson.  I really just do not know.  The only thing that I ever heard Uncle Everett talk about to me personally was Watergate.  After he had left the senate I invited. him and Aunt Katherine to come see us the Friday after Thanksgiving. The mills were closed and they spent the night.  I said, &quot;Uncle Everett, I want you to tell me about Watergate, because we have young children, and sometime when they are of age I&#x27;d like to tell them what you had to say and I won&#x27;t talk about this thing until then.  I&#x27;m giving a promise of confidentiality for some time, and in exchange I want you what to be candid.  You can trust me not to divulge/you have to say.&quot; You know it tickled him a little bit.  So they came over and spent t     i H. Jordan II                        ,       2 0        i    ^ ,   * the night and we must have talked until midnight.  Aunt Katherine, my wife Dianne, Uncle Everett and me.  He didn&#x27;t say a lot of memorable thingsI ask him, among other things, was this typical of what goes on from time to time in Washington, &#x27;and he,,said, &quot;No.  Watergate was not.&quot;  And he was a knowy guy.  Some people are just  they know the gossipUncle Everett was that sort.  Some people have great causes to champion and all they really know about is their cause, and people don&#x27;t tell them nothing, but Uncle Everett was a gossipy, knowy guy, and that says to me that no, this is not a typicalthat&#x27;s going to happen every two or three years event.  And I remember asking him about the cast of characters and he said that one fellow that is still living was an absolute &quot;bag man&quot; that the guy would come in and say, &quot;What do you want?&quot;  And they would say we would like the port reworked and he would say, &quot;That would cost you $62 5,000, put the money in the bag.&quot;  And this is the guy who was included in the Watergate thing as a money man and was ultimately tried and not convicted.  But I still remember that man and what Uncle Everett had to say about him, and have no doubt in my mind that this guy was crooked.  He was accused correctly; he just didn&#x27;t get convicted. BB:  The bagman money was for reelection purposes? HJ:  Or for whatever and the only reason I say &#x27;whatever&#x27; is I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t know, but apparently these people accumulated money for whatever BB:  Lobbying purposes too? HJ:  It&#x27;s hard to say.  I&#x27;m parenthetically thinking about my Grandfather Jordan, the ministerit&#x27;s hard to have your hands on a lot of/?money without messing up with it.  You&#x27;ve been in the money  H. Jordan II                                            21 business and I&#x27;m sure if you think back about the people who worked with you you&#x27;ve had some people that have stole some money.  Little moneyyou never could maybe catch thembut money is just a funny thing; if you really get too interested in it, it will make a fool out of you.  It&#x27;s just a matter of whether you detect it, but I think that is true.  My grandaddy, interestingly, made a decent amount of money as a minister. BB:  He left an estate of $50,000 in the depression era. I HJ:  And/think gave thirty or thirty-three to Duke.  He gave each of his children a thousand dollars, he provided for Grandmother Jordan and I don&#x27;t know what that amounted tobut I believe he gave $30,000 to Duke.  I think his point to his children was:  Money is fine if you want to go after it and work at it, but he wasn&#x27;t just going to give it to them.  I think that&#x27;s right.  I do know though that when he was a minister here in Walkertown that there wasn&#x27;t a business or industry there.  That was where Uncle Frank was born.  So that was sometime into his ministry; he persuaded local people to put up the money, and he participated, and they started a chair factory, and it provided jobs for people there.  And I know over time they made money, and in those days woodworking factories had a bad habit of catching on fire, and this one did and ultimately burned down, and he was no longer living in Walkertown, and I don&#x27;t think they started it back. I&#x27;ve heard people tell me that he was the best judge of real estate in Gastonia-rhe preached there and he was District Superintendent and he lived therethan anybody in town, that he had an instinct for seeing where property values were going to go up and investing in it.  H. Jordan II 22 , But I never knew him.  I don&#x27;t remember when he died.  My grandmother was living after I was born, but I don&#x27;t remember her. BB:  Your grandfather died before you were born.  She died in the 30&#x27;s. HJ:  I was born in &#x27;34.  He must have died early,&quot;in the &#x27;30&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know.                                                                                                                 - ; BB:  Do you ever remember your dad telling stories about your grand- &gt; father?                             ,      ^  .,                       -^ ,; / ..                      &gt;,  , HJ:  I can tell you one he told; he told it for a purpose.  He said thatmy father was a dentist and he was apparently very successful in his practice and he accumulated some moeny and bought a car, and he was so proud of having a car, and he went by to see his daddy and he said his daddy was sitting on the porch and he asked him to come take a ride with him, and Grandaddy Jordan said, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; and papa said, &quot;Oh I don&#x27;t know, just around.&quot; and Grandaddy said, &quot;Nope, if you don&#x27;t know where you are going I don&#x27;t want to go.&quot; But apparently he was an inspiration to those children. My father told me one dayand I think he was trying to make me feel betterhe said, &quot;You know, when I was a little boy people always told me that I would never be as good a man as your daddy. And you know I felt like that was the case.&quot;  But I know that when I was a young man I thought I would never be as smart as my father, and I think that&#x27;s probably true because he was a wise guy.  You couldn&#x27;t foolhi.. BB:  Did you ever try? HJ:  Yes.  But I&#x27;m really thinking of the older people that he contended with in politics.  Politics, so often, is a game of somebody       H. Jordan II                                               2 3 wants to get  something for nothing.  You just couldn&#x27;t fool him on that thingyou couldn&#x27;t do it.  I do remember after he died all sorts of people, when I would meet &quot;them, would&#x27;tell me how much they thought of him.  You know that&#x27;s expected, but I&quot; remember one Sunday I was visiting mother and I would go down to the cotton mill to walk around just to see what was going on, and the night watchman, old man Johnny Allredyou may remember him-WI- don&#x27;t know how old Mr. Allred was but &#x27;&#x27;.*  .      ,  - f J-&#x27;.,&#x27;-,                                                                                              *&#x27;&quot;.; he was not a young man, but he said to me, &quot;I miss your daddy&quot; and what he said next was what I&#x27;ll never forget.  He said, &quot;He always gave me good advice.&quot;  He meant thatI don&#x27;t know what advice he gave Mr. Allred, but the idea that he was tuned enough to what Mr. Allred was doing to give him advice, and that Mr. Allred didn&#x27;t mind asking himthat was a real compliment. Ben, I&#x27;m sort of running out of things to remember. BB:  You have already, in a way, touched on this, but as far as political philosophy is concerned how would you describe your father? HJ:  He was a product of the depression in that he felt very strongly that you had to pay for it as you went along.  A good example was the It a gallon gas tax to finance the road building program that Scott wanted to do.  It was pretty simple; it was part of the package.  If you approved the bond you also approved the way to pay for them.  I&#x27;m trying to remember the details of selling the bonds.  I think I have it right.  After they passed the bond issue then they had to sell the bonds.  Somebody had to buy the things, and that was not necessarily his end of the business.  The state treasurer normally did that.  They were having a meeting and the question was, how much is it going to cost in interest.  What was.  the cost of the bonds going to be, and H. Jordan II                                              24 the treasurer said, &quot;It&#x27;s going to cost--&quot; I don&#x27;t remember a number but let us just say that it was 5% which that was a reasonably high rate of interest for 1949 I expect, and my father said, &quot;That&#x27;s too much money.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to pay 5% for a bond that is self liquidating.  The state was in good shape for money, and the answer was, &quot;If you can do any better, feel free.&quot;  And so he didwhat he did was to go around to all these counties and he said to these political people, &quot;Look we want to get started on these roads and we&#x27;ve got to sell the bonds and they are going to cost us more than I think are they ought to.  Now I&#x27;ve already told you the story that there/100 counties and I&#x27;m going to use that again.  I want all 100 counties I want the banks in these counties to participate in buying the bonds. Nobody has to buy too much at that rate.&quot; The major banks thought they were sitting in the &quot;cat bird&#x27;s seat&quot; and they could name the price because they were going to have to buy all of the bonds.  So you can imagine going into the Bank of Biscoand you could go here and you could go thereand he took the time and he would go to see these peoplelet&#x27;s say they were working Statesvillfior Iredell County, and they would just go down the street and they would talk to these bankers, and say, &quot;Now look, 5xdaK*xMaRxBxgKtxbtaatEd if you don&#x27;t want to get blamed for keeping people from having paved roads all you got to do is buy a measley $50,000 worth of bonds., Everybody&#x27;s going to be doing it, and we want to sell these things for 2h%   (that&#x27;s a number I&#x27;m picking out of the air to illustrate), but you know it&#x27;s a good bond and you&#x27;re not taking a risk and you&#x27;re doing something for your county, and we will tell people what you are doing, so you are going - -:&#x27; -    r   , .         i ;; :  .:&#x27;    .    &#x27; &#x27; : to get praise for doing this.&quot;  And he went back to Raleigh and said, &quot;I just sold those things for 3%%.&quot;  And he did. BB:  Did he sell all of them? HJ:  Sold all of them, and the big banks, when they found out what was going onthose were good bonds, and so they came in and bought. BB:  He was a shrewd politician sure enough. HJ:  He also, at one meeting of the Highway Commission early on, they were talking about paving these secondary roads and the engineer said it&#x27;s going to cost (an illustration) $10,000,000 to buy the right-of-way. And he said, &quot;The hell you say, it&#x27;s not going to cost anything.&quot;  And they said, &quot;Now you don&#x27;t understand, people charge for the right-of-way.&quot; And he said, &quot;No, you don&#x27;t understand.  Have you ever lived on a dirt road, and everybody else wanted to get it paved and you were standing in the way?  All you got to do is get out there and persuade people we&#x27;re going to pave these roads as soon as everyone dedicates the right-of-way.  So you see we&#x27;re not going to have to buy these right-of-ways.  Now if you&#x27;re going to cut right through a guy&#x27;s farm, that&#x27;s different.&quot;  But the thrust of paving was:  Don&#x27;t change that road-bed to any great degreedon&#x27;t do a lot of cuffing, don&#x27;t do a lot of filling.  You&#x27;re going to maximize how much you can pave by paving existing roads, bring the roadbeds to standard and pave it.  He said, &quot;You can forget about that ten million dollars, it ain&#x27;t going to happen.&quot;  But he was wise in that way. BB:  Henry, who is still living that was a contemporary of your father that I could talk to about your father. H. Jordan II                                              2 6 HJ:  Archie Davis.  Probably that&#x27;s the best, because Archie wanted him to run for governor one time. . BB:  One source I have said that your father on three different occasions was considered for governor of this stateas you know he never ran at allI think the last time was in the case of Dan Moore. I was told by John Jordan that your father was sick in the hospital when this Dan Moore was considering runningthat Dan Moore came to the hospital where your daddy was and told him, &quot;If you&#x27;ll run, I won&#x27;t run.&quot;  Did he give you any confirmation of that? HJ:  I&#x27;ve heard something about that but what I know is also in addition to that. BB:  Where was your father hospitilized?  In Randolph County? HJ:  No, he was at the Moses Cone, and he thought he might have cancer, and they couldn&#x27;t find out. BB:  Of the throat? HJ:  I don&#x27;t think it was generalized they just thought he might have cancer.  I don&#x27;t think it was the throat.  His father and mother both died of cancer; Aunt Lucy died of cancer while I was at Duke prior to that.  He thought about that.  He wanted to run that time, and he said, &quot; I was lying there in that hospital bed and I thought that was not an easy job,&quot; and it isn&#x27;t, and he said, &quot;The more I thought about it the less I  thought of the idea.&quot;  Then they came in and told him he had a bad gall bladder, but he had made his mind up that he didn&#x27;t want to run, and he called Moore and told him he was not going to run, and that he would support him.  And Moore said, &quot;Where do you think I am?&quot;  And he said, &quot;At this point you are 125,000 votes behind.&quot; &#x27;H. Jordan II                                              27  And Moore said, &quot;how come you are going to support me?&quot;  And he said, &quot;Because I&#x27;m going to make you win.&quot;  He said, &quot;I think you are a better choice.&quot;  And his reasoning was this:  He said that Preyer was &lt;\ &#x27; %    i   :   ! %-&#x27; &amp; a nice fellow, and I think he is, but Preyer has zero experience in f  ..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -        -      .     . running an organization.  He had been a lawyer; Kennedy had appointed him to the federal bench, but he never had run anything.  You go back to the days when he was running the Highway Department and they were spending the most of the money in the state for those four years, you find out that running something is a second hand experience.  You don&#x27;t run anything.  You have to get a bunch of people to run things for you, and if you aren&#x27;t good at picking those people then you&#x27;ve got problems.  His point was that Preyer just did not have the experience and he would be, in essence, at the mercy of the people who were pushing him to run to pick who was going to be the running of the state, and he thought that was a poor idea.  Whether he knew at the time that he could get enough people to work for Moore, I don&#x27;t know; but he thought he could, and two primaries later he had. I still remember one story:  Mr. Lake came to see him at some time and said, &quot;Doctor, what does it take to get elected governor?&quot; And papa said, &quot;Well to start with, a half million dollars; have you got it?&quot;  Then Lake said, &quot;No&#x27;.&#x27; and he said, &quot;I think you&#x27;re going to have problems.&quot;  But that&#x27;s a good story about him.  You can hear him saying that and it was factual.  He had to have access to that much money at that time. BB:  Was that when Lake was running against Richardson Preyer and Dan Moore? HJ:  I&#x27;m trying to think, Ben, and I don&#x27;t know because I think Lake H. Jordan II 28 made two passes at that thing and I think it may have, been the prior time.  I think that for this reason:  I don&#x27;t know that Lake would haveI don&#x27;t think papa would have let Lake come see him if papa was pushing for Moore.  I doubt it.  I suspect it was the first around, The last guy that he helped was Robert Scott, and he was sick in the Randolph Hospital in Asheboro and he was dying and Robert wanted to talk to him.  Scott ran against Gardner, didn&#x27;t he?  I believe so. Gardner was a popular guy and Robert wanted some instruction, and so he came over to the hospital and mother never really liked politics; she didn&#x27;t dislike it, but shethat wasn&#x27;t something she liked, and Robert was there all afternoon and they talkedI&#x27;m gathering that they sort of went county by countywhat papa thought of this and what he thought of that, and mother was reading the Reader&#x27;s Digest  \ and I don&#x27;t think she took her nose out of the book the whole time. are So when Robert left, papa said, &quot;Honey, how/you going to get invited to the inaugural ball when you don&#x27;t even speak to the next governor?&quot; Mama said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care to go.&quot;  But as far as he was concerned Scott was ultimately going to pull it off, and he did. What I do remember, Hodges appointed Uncle Everett, and I don&#x27;t know whether it was^in:his first administration or not; it could have been, but I do remember,this.  Papa was not that, &quot;nuts&quot; about Hodges. He just wasn&#x27;t, and he thought about running against Hodges when Hodges ran for reelection for Governor and-he went&#x27;abound the state and talked to people and then he had a press conference in Asheboro and all these people came in and they wanted to know what he was going to do, and he said, &quot;I have decided not to run for governor.&quot;  And they   H. Jordan II                                              2 9 - said, &quot;Why?&quot; and he said, &quot;KaaxEaxxtxaaazxhim I&#x27;ve been out talking to all these people, and you can-&#x27;t beat him!&quot;  And he was right.  If you remember Hodges was just a run-away in that election.  But he &quot;                                 K  J                                .&quot; was that kind of person*  It didn&#x27;t offend himit didn&#x27;t hurt his pride that Hodges was so popular at the time.  He was perfectly accurate about what was going to happen.  I&#x27;ll tell you another story about his accuracy:                                                   *. .;* Harold Cooley was our congressman and Cooley had been congressman for a long time and he had been accused of being too faborable to the sugar people and of accumulating a lot of money and just generally if not becoming arrogant, seeming to be arrogant.  I believe Gardner was running against him and the tide was pretty much for Republicans that year and Art Weiner, who played football at Chapel Hill, was managing Cooley&#x27;s campaign in Guilford County and he thought of papa as his mentor.  Papa thought like Cooley was going to lose and you couldn&#x27;t reverse it and Weiner was wonderingWeiner had worked and traveled with papa a lot and he considered papa was financially a conservative guy.  He didn&#x27;t go buy steaks every night when they were travelinghe didn&#x27;t throw money around easily, and so Weiner was pushing papa one day about &quot;Are you sure Cooley can win?&quot; and papa didn&#x27;t want to tell him and so (this is illustrative) he didn&#x27;t &quot;I&#x27;ll bet you answer him.  He said/a steak dinner for you and your wife that Cooley wins.&quot;  Now mind you, he didn&#x27;t say he was going to win, but Weiner thought that Dr. Jordan would never bet a steak if he thought he was going to lose, so he went out and worked as hard as he could on that premise, and when it was over he said, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you tell me?&quot; - - ... H. Jordan II                                              3 0 Papa said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t something to tell you, Art&quot; you needed to get out there and work, and if I had told you what I thought was going to happen, you wouldn&#x27;t have been able to work as good.&quot;  And he said, &quot;So it cost me a couple of steak dinners.&quot; But that&#x27;s the way he did things.  A little bit later on .  -                           H -       . &#x27;     : i           f BB:  Did Cooley win that election?  -    * HJ:  No, Cooley lost:.  It cost papa the steak dinners.  He just was not going to tell Weiner that Weiner was correct, that Cooley was going to lose.  Gardner had captured people&#x27;s imagination, and too many negative things had been said about Cooley; and he liked Cooley, but he was realistic about the thing. I do remember another election after that when my fahter was in the State Senate, and he was running for reelection and this was the year when there was a Republican sweep and I don&#x27;t remember the year. BB:  Randolph is a Republican county. HJ:  It is but he had always been elected.  He didn&#x27;t run that much himself.  But in that year all across the state Republicans won.  At any rate he was running for reelection to the State Senate and he percieved that most likely it would be tough to win.  In the midst of that election the black politicians from Greensboroand Randolph was paired with Guilford at the timecame to him and said if you don&#x27;t do some things that we wantif you don&#x27;t agree to do some things we want to get done we&#x27;re going to support the Republicans.  They could have not made him madder and he sat there and he balanced the two things and he said if I agree I&#x27;ll win the election, and if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll lose the election.  And this is the man that since 1940 had seldom been on the wrong side of an election.  And he said, &quot;Gentlemen H. Jordan II                                              31 I can&#x27;t help you.&quot;  And they said, &quot;Well we&#x27;re going to fight against you.&quot;  And he said, &quot;You know that&#x27;s part of what freedom is.&quot;  And so they went out there and he lost, and he krfew long, long before it happened what was going to happen, but he would not change; he would not compromise his principles.  You just could not influence him. BB:  That was the second time he ran for State Senate? HJ:  Yes I think it was.  He didn&#x27;t really love being in the State Senate.  It was all right and it was fun to do, but it was more of the kind of thing he had to get talked into doing.  I think Randolph County needed somebody down there with some clout, because it never had gotten a lot of whatever the legislature could do for you individually and I think he thought that was worthwhile, and he sure didn&#x27;t want to lose, but when it came to the choice he had to make he didn&#x27;t hesitatehe told them then they&#x27;d have to come back and find out what the answer wasand I don&#x27;t have any recollection who these people were, basically they were from Guilford County.  That&#x27;s just the way it worked out; but he didn&#x27;t regret that. I asked him one time about regrets and he said, &quot;None, I just don&#x27;t regret anything I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;  The other time he wanted to run was following Scott&#x27;s administration and Uncle Everett wouldn&#x27;t support him.  He hung his hat on the fact that he had promised Larkins that he would support him, but the reason papa didn&#x27;t run in that 7^ election was that Uncle Everett wouldn&#x27;t support him. BB:  For what reason? HJ:  I don&#x27;t know. BB:  Who ran that year? HJ:  Larkins and Terry Sanford and Malcolm Seawell and somebody else. T7 f\   &#x27; * I H. Jordan II                                              3 2 BB:     That&#x27;s the year your daddy considered running? HJ:     Yes and he felt like he could win too. BB:     And who won that year? HJ:     Sanfordand he helped Sanford some in the run-off.  I remember Sanford came by the house with his wife  and a highway patrolman and he all of that.  They went somewhere to some celebration and/went sort of because he said he would go, but he wasn&#x27;t jumping up and down about that.  Bill Cochrane is a great Sanford fan, they were together at Chapel Hill.  Worked their way through school together.  He thought that when Sanford proposed raising the food tax that it was unnecessary. His opinion was that Sanford had just not been around long enough to know.  Sanford was a fairly young man when he was governor and he said you know, &quot;You don&#x27;t ever get rid of a tax.  That&#x27;s the bad thing.  I don&#x27;t think they need the moneythey&#x27;ll spend it, but we won&#x27;t get rid of the tax.&quot;  You know when he came to Randolph County he had been on the Gaston County School Board and Randolph County and Cedar Falls there was no water in their schools.  There was no water! and he thought that was an abomination; and Gray&#x27;s Chapel had a well.  And they asked him to serve on the school board because he had this experience* in this larger countyand he did.  I think he was responsible for saying, &quot;Hey you got to find the money and put water in these schools.&quot;  But I remember when I started in Cedar Falls there were three outhouses.  One for the teachers, one for the girls and one for the boys.  The next year they added the wing on the school that had the bathrooms, and I was convinced it was because xxx%%&amp;xk%%#:%x% Ann was coming to school that year, -(laughs)  I was convinced that if Ann hadn&#x27;t come there wouldn&#x27;t have been any water. &#x27;I &quot;    I v  ,     /&#x27;A     i *  - &gt; ,&#x27; -.. H-fn.*h - HJ II                                                              3 3 BB:  So you folks went to school in Cedar Falls? HJ:  Yes, until I was in the 6th grade and Ann was in the 5th and there were no more grades there at that time they had moved them down to Franklinville and he thought it would be better for us to go to Asheboro school, and so in those days you could do that.  It cost $25 a year or something, and I know Max Redding at Cedar Falls had gone to school in Asheboro and so Coy Laughlinhe&#x27;s dead nowdrove us.  We had that old &#x27;41 LaSalle and he would take us in the morning and pick us up in the afternoon.  I think that Tom started that year and so all three of us went. Another story about him:  When he was on the Highway Commission the driveway to the house was not paved and mother wanted to get it paved. &#x27; He said, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going to do that and I&#x27;ll tell you why. If you&#x27;re Chairman of the Highway Commission there&#x27;s no way that you can get a fair bid on paving your driveway.  Somebody is going to do it for nothing or they&#x27;ll just give it to you real cheap, and I don&#x27;t want the criticism.&quot;  So mother said, &quot;It&#x27;s very dusty out there.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.  Wait until I finish my term and we&#x27;ll pave it.&quot; They built that driveway out of cinders from the mill and he knew he could build a roadbed out of cinders because the water percolates through it, but it&#x27;s so hard that it makes a wonderful roadbed.  So we had a great roadbed; it wasn&#x27;t mushy or muddy or anything else, but in the summertime when it was dry it was pretty dusty.  But one of the highway commissioners, Dr. Art-, from down between Selma and Clayton paved his driveway while he was on the highway commission and paid for it and Carl Georchyou remember the commentator?was a amateur pilotprivate pilotand he was flying around down there jx- HJ II                                                              34 and he knew where Dr. &#x27;Harp lived and he saw them paving his driveway. Within a week it was in the paper or on the radio, &quot;Wonder who&#x27;s paying for Dr. AaHH s driveway.&quot;  Papa told mama, &quot;Now you understand what I was telling you?  You&#x27;ll just have to wait.&quot; :  Is that Arp?.    &#x27; :  No, it&#x27;s Earp.  I&#x27;ve met him and I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s still BB:  Is that Arp?  living, but he was a very highly trainedI want to say surgeon, Ben and he had done his residency somewhere in a large hospital up north, came back to North Carolina and wanted to practice down there where the people needed better medicine.  So he did, and he farms and he&#x27; has this medical practice.  And I remember visiting him one time about papa.  I was just passing through, I don&#x27;t remember much else about it,&quot;but they were great friends, and he told me the same story about .....                                                        -.                                                                                                                 , Georch flying over and how indignant he was. BB:  Georch was editor of The State Magazine. HJ:  Did he also have a radio show?  Anyway Georch had assumed that he was getting a freebee out of it. BB:  Let&#x27;s discuss Everett Jordan a little bit Henry.  You may have heard things that your dad might have said or you may have your own observations.  How would you or your father describe Everett Jordan? HJ:  He was tough to do business with.  He really worked hard to get done what he wanted to do.  He wanted things on his terms.  I think he was a very observant guy; I think he knew the market well; I don&#x27;t think he was, afraid of.the market; I don&#x27;t think he tended to price at the top of the market, but I don&#x27;t think his product was at the top of the market either.  I think he felt like there was more room &#x27; in the middle for selling yarn, and it wasn&#x27;t bad yarn, in fact it / -  : was good yarn, but he sold some on price and just wanted to: be in the middle.  He drove so hard that he did alienate some people in the businessin the spinning business.  Case in point:  During the war when they needed to buy yarn for the mercerizing plant he had difficulty getting people to sell to him.  And my fahter did that and he didn&#x27;t have the same trouble.  My&quot;father also owned stock in most of those mills in Belmont and it&#x27;was original issue stock.  But that is some the difference ,in the people.  He had made people mad over the time, and so they weren&#x27;t going to go out of the way to be helpful.  I think he was an honest man. BB:  How did he alienate people? HJ:  Partly throughif he was by a customer sometimesif they were selling a guy and Uncle Everett wanted and needed the business, and just came in and cut the price and took the customer away. BB:  Through price maneuvering? HJ:  Yes pretty much.  I think he was honest-that&#x27;s about all I know. Hethat&#x27;s about all I know, really. BB:  Did he have any outstanding character traits that you observed? HJ:  Hard driving and hardand smart smart. BB:  Were there any similarities between your dad and Everett Jordan? HJ:  They both loved to tell stories.  They loved to tell stories. They both liked Duke-I think that was a reflection of their daddy; they remembered his loyalty to Duke.  They liked the church. BB:  Do you remember any so called church stories that they told? HJ:  No I don&#x27;t. BB:  Do any other stories come to mind? HJ:  I don&#x27;t know many of Uncle Everett&#x27;s stories.  - -. H. Jordanll                                                 3 6 BB:  Do you have any more that your dad might have told? HJ:  No.......good,.he was a good senator.  I think that&#x27;s probably the pinnacle to his&#x27; career.  He was an excellent senator. He cared about the state and his staff worked hard to take care of the state. Ithink he inherited most of his staff from Scott and they didn&#x27;t expect to stay and they were happy that they did.  And I think the Cooper/Church thing was a pretty good illustration.of him at his best. I don&#x27;t know that he and Mr. Ervin were particularly close.  They had known each other since childhood, because Grandaddy Jordan was preaching in Morganton when they were -^x-t^~-se-V-en.---or---eight .years old, and they had known each other, but Ervin was so interested in the Constitution before everybody else was, and Uncle Everett wasn&#x27;t particularly interested in that.  That, to him, was sort of ait was just something for the book.  He was not particularlyI don&#x27;t think of him as a reader.  He was an action...par s on.  Action was what was interesting to him. BB:  Sam Ervin described him as being a &quot;loaves and fishes&quot; senator. HJ:  This was getting the loaves and fishes for the people back home. BB:  Right.  One thing we haven&#x27;t talked about at all, Henry, was your daddy&#x27;s role in the prison system change.  Mike Jordan just mentioned it briefly how youthful offenders were separated from the hardened adults-- HJ:  I&#x27;m not familar with that.  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, but I&#x27;m just not familiar.  I am familiar with a story when Hodges was governor and I think my father was in the State Senate then.  Hodges had this wonderful idea to get politics out of the Highway Department and separate the prison system from the Highway Department, and my fahter thought  r i : .... H. Jordan II                                              37 8 &quot; it was just nonsense.  And so he made a small speech in the senate about this, and he said that he thought for various reasons it was not a good idea, and he said, &quot;Let me tell you somehting.  Getting- politics out of the Highway Department is very much like getting rid of dandruff.  It&#x27;ll come backit&#x27;s a waste of time to pursue it.&quot; And that was pretty much his styleto call it something like dandruff. BB:  Why did Everett lose the last time he ran? HJ:  I think the big thing was that people thought he was sick more than anything else.  People have told me that if my fahter had been alive Uncle Everett would have won.  You know I think that might be truebut you don&#x27;t know.  That was tough because he was old and people thought he was oldold for the time, and people were pretty sure he was sick.  He never lost while my father was alive, but you don&#x27;t know about that.  You just don&#x27;t know. the role of BB:  How would you assess/Frank Jordan as state chairman for Everett Jordan in that election? HJ:  Joe Crawford told me something one time I think is right.  Joe said people had trouble telling a preacher the facts of life that weren&#x27;t pleasant, and I think that&#x27;s true.  But people forget that preachers know more about the unpleasant facts of life than they ever discuss, because the members of their congregation who do have troubles and do talk to their preacher--tell them some of t&#x27;he worse things they ever know of.  Public perception is that you can&#x27;t tell a preacher something that is not 100% savory. BB:  What was Joe Crawford&#x27;s official position? HJ:  He was on Uncle Everett&#x27;s staff and hethey had two people at that time who lived in the state and represented the senator in just &#x27;     -&#x27;   &#x27;     - &#x27;  -&#x27; &#x27;. f &#x27;         &#x27;          ! QlfflS  ? ife i H. Jordan II                                              3 8 going around.  They&#x27;re bird dogs.  If someone comes to the senator and says we need such and such, then a Joe Crawford goes and looks into it and comes back and says, &quot;That&#x27;s right, or no, this guy just wants to make a lot of money, and everybody else is not in favor of it.&quot;  You have to have someone that&#x27;s a local person if you are going to be in Washington most of the year.  How else do you know?  And at that point Joe was in the western part of the atate and somebody else was in. the eastern part of the state.  And that was Joe&#x27;s function. BB:  I&#x27;ve seen him in Saxapahaw from time to time, but really didn&#x27;t know the exact connection. HJ:  Joe had done the same thing for Kerr Scott. BB:  Thank you very much Henry, you&#x27;ve been most helpful.</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Patricia Neal moved to Durham, North Carolina, from Connecticut in 1953 to study nursing at Duke University. Shortly thereafter, she married, started a family, and left school to help support her husband while he finished his medical training. Neal and her family settled in Durham, and during the late 1950s and early 1960s she became involved in the Parent-Teacher Association and the League of Women&#x27;s Voters, and began working as a substitute teacher. In 1964, Neal spent a year monitoring the County Board of Education for the League. Her dissatisfaction with their decisions led her to run for a position on the Board as a Republican in 1968. Neal lost the election by a small margin, but was appointed several months later when one of the five seats was vacated. After serving nearly eighteen years on the board, and as the chairman for five, Neal was appointed to the North Carolina Board of Directors of the North Carolina Board of Education Association. In this interview, she describes the role of the County Board of Education in the process of integration in Durham Schools during the 1960s and 1970s. In so doing, Neal pays particular attention to African American leadership, demographics, and community responses to integration. After briefly discussing the presence of African American students at one Durham school, Hope Valley School, Neal shifts the focus to the impact of Alexander v. Holmes (1969) on Durham schools. As Neal describes it, the Board had no resistance to integration but wanted to postpone until the end of the school year so that the students would not be disrupted. Their request was denied, and just before schools broke for the Christmas holiday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that they integrate by the first of the year. Neal describes the role of the Board in this process and argues that integration occurred smoothly and with only one incident of racial tension at Northern High School, which she and the Board helped to mediate. In addition, Neal discusses the decline of Durham City schools as a result of integration; her thoughts on problems facing education following integration, including the issue of busing; and the role of gender in her own career.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  KATHRYN NASSTROM: This is Kathy Nasstrom interviewing Patricia Neal on June 6, 1989 for the Southern Oral History Program, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about the civil rights movement in North Carolina, and particularly, school desegregation along with the topic, generally, of women in politics. I&#x27;d like to start with some background information, how long you&#x27;ve lived in Durham, and if you&#x27;d tell me a little bit about your family background.  PATRICIA NEAL: Okay. Kathy, I came to Durham in 1953 as an undergraduate in the Duke Nursing School. At that point, Duke was the only college in the country that offered a four year Bachelor&#x27;s Degree program in nursing. I grew up in Hartford, Connecticut. I was born on February 12, 1935. My father was a physician, pathologist, and my mother was a nurse, and I have two younger brothers who are still living in the Hartford, Connecticut area. I met my husband at Duke. He was a medical student, and we were married in 1955 and have essentially been in Durham ever since. After my husband finished his training, residency, in pediatrics, he went into practice in Durham in 1960, and we&#x27;ve been here ever since and have raised four children here.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: From your growing up years, do you recall any important family influences, stories that were told that stick with you or memories that seem particularly important?  PATRICIA NEAL: I think, I had a very, very good and very supportive family. It never occurred to me that I&#x27;d do anything except nursing, from the time I was old enough to really think about what it was that I wanted to do. From the time I was about twelve, I think, I started working in a small county hospital where my father worked, as, I guess, a sort of candy striper. And then when I was old enough to get a work permit when I was fifteen, I guess, I spent every summer and every vacation until I went to Duke working in this county hospital and gradually assumed more and more responsibility and was really doing some pretty heavy-duty nursing before I ever went to nursing school. I&#x27;d also say that I grew up during World War II. My father was in the service. We moved from Connecticut to Atlanta, Georgia, where my dad was stationed, and then subsequently, he went over seas to India. So he was gone from &#x27;43 until &#x27;46. So that was a very difficult period where my mother was alone, and there was a lot of anxiety about whether Dad would make it back because, at that point, they were planning to invade China and Japan before the atomic bomb. I think, and I was the oldest child in the family, and I think I assumed a lot of responsibility. So there were a number of things in my background that made our family, I think, very close, but also probably made me mature beyond my years. I never had any fears about when I found out that the quickest way to get a nursing degree was to go to Duke University. There was never any question in my mind that I&#x27;d get on an airplane and fly to Durham, North Carolina. So that&#x27;s a little bit about my family background.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Do you feel that your family was, you mentioned being close, do you think also supportive of your aspirations and what you were interested in doing?  PATRICIA NEAL: Very definitely, yes. They were very supportive and gave me a great deal of encouragement. Also, I think, I recall both my mother and my father as being very, very gentle people and very caring people, and I think when I met my husband, Charlie, and found out that he was a doctor and wanted to be a pediatrician, it clicked immediately that we both came from somewhat similar backgrounds in the way that we had been raised and the way that our families had taught us to care about other people. That maybe sounds a bit trite, but it&#x27;s true.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: What we&#x27;re going to spend a lot of time on is your work on the School Board, the Durham County School Board, so the point at which you more or less left behind the idea of spending a lot of time on nursing, could you describe how that happened?  PATRICIA NEAL: As much as I wanted to be a nurse, and it&#x27;s an unfulfilled dream of mine, and, in fact, I&#x27;ve applied to Watts Hospital to go back, to finish my nursing.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: And that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re in the process of doing?  PATRICIA NEAL: In the process of doing right now. It&#x27;s just an unfinished chapter in my life that I&#x27;ve always been very unhappy about, but circumstances just prevented that. I was married in the middle of my junior year at Duke and got pregnant on my honeymoon, and then it became a matter of, at that point, Dr. Neal was an intern, and interns earned twenty-five dollars a month in those days. There was absolutely no way that he could continue with his medical training and I could go back to school and somehow take care of a baby, so from then on his career, or survival, depended really on his pursuing his career. We had always talked about having four children, and that&#x27;s the way it turned out. I had always said that I wanted a) to be a nurse and b) to be married and have four children, so then the process of raising those four children consumed all my time and energy. So that&#x27;s where I spent about seventeen years of my life, getting those young ones raised.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: There are four kids in my family, too, and my mom also spent those years at home, and we were a handful, that&#x27;s for sure.  PATRICIA NEAL: It takes a great deal of energy. It really does. I guess, the payoff is that all four of them are happy and successful and productive, and they were good kids and really, other than the occasional speeding ticket and minor crises, never gave us really any significant problems.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Am I right, then, in saying, and I think I picked this up from when you were describing your work on the School Board, that you began that once your kids were, was it out of high school or out of college all together?  PATRICIA NEAL: No, they were still, I started, well, it was a natural involvement, really, through participation in PTA, and they had established a program for gifted and talented kids, and I spoke some French, so I did some volunteer teaching in the Gifted and Talented Program teaching French to fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh graders. It was a natural evolvement of activities with the children through the PTA and other organizations, so the boys were still in grade school, and the girls were in junior high and high school.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: When you were doing the PTA work?  PATRICIA NEAL: Right.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: OKAY. What I think it might be good to establish at this point, because we&#x27;re moving into the topic I very much want to cover, is the chronology of your time on the School Board because it was eighteen years, I believe you mentioned earlier. So I&#x27;d like to know if you could map out the years that you served, the different positions that you held along the way.  PATRICIA NEAL: The School Board grew out of an involvement in two areas. One was the PTA and school, well, actually three areas. One was the PTA and substitute teaching and volunteer teaching. Secondly, I had, when I first registered to vote in Durham, having been brought up in a conservative, Republican family in New England, I really felt … it became obvious to me very early on that there was not a viable two-party system in North Carolina, and I felt very strongly that until there was a viable two party system that government in North Carolina at all levels, local, state, and federal, would suffer because of the lack of competition and that kind of thing, and the calibre of candidates. So when I was able to register in 1956 for the first time, I registered as a Republican, and an aside to that is that the Registrar said, and here I was, twenty-one, which is the age you had to be to register at that point. The Registrar was a little old lady at West Durham Community Center. She said, &quot;Young lady, I don&#x27;t think you want to do that because you can&#x27;t vote in the primaries if you register as a Republican.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, thank you very much for your advice, but I do want to do this.&quot; But that was the sort of thing that you faced, so I had a commitment to Republican politics. Third, the League of Women Voters in Durham, at that time, was dominated by pretty much liberal women Democrats and primarily from the Duke community. And yet, I felt that they were doing some extremely worthwhile things, and I thought it was important #1) because they did have a commitment to a better political process. They were, at that time, monitoring all the Boards and Commissions as they still do very effectively, and so I wanted to become involved with the League of Women Voters for two reasons. One was perhaps to represent a different perspective than some of the other members, and two because I did want to become involved with the school and educational process and saw this as an organization that could accomplish both purposes. When I joined the League of Women Voters, they were looking for somebody, at the first meeting in September, they needed people to monitor the City Council, County Commissioners, etc., so I volunteered to monitor the Durham County Board of Education. This would have been in the fall of &#x27;68, I think. So I spent an entire year going to the Durham County School Board meetings. No, I take it back. It would have been the fall of &#x27;67. So I spent a whole year monitoring the Board, and I saw some things going on, some decisions being made by that Board… At that point, it was a partisan Board. There were five Democrats—four men and one woman, and I saw some decisions being made that I literally, as a League observer, we were absolutely forbidden to say anything in those meetings. We just had to sit there and listen and observe and report our observations back to the League, but I remember literally holding onto the chair with the knuckles of my hands just white at some of the decisions that were being made.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Would you give an example of such a decision?  PATRICIA NEAL: One that I remember in particular was the Board voted to spend, and I&#x27;ve forgotten what the sum was, but a considerable amount of money, to buy a trophy case for Jordan High School. Never mind that Merrick-Moore, which was a high school, a K-12 union school at that point, had won numerous state championships in the years before, and Merrick-Moore was an all-black high school at that point in time. They had won many championships, and the Board had never bought them a trophy case, but the very first time that Jordan High School won a state championship, the Board is spending money. Of course, the other thing you need to understand, which I&#x27;m sure you do, is that I grew up in the North and grew up in a family in which I was taught and raised that all people are equal, and I had been to school with black children although there weren&#x27;t a large number of them at that point. I had worked with black people at the hospital where I worked, so I came to the South with no knowledge really, very naive about what prejudice was, and it was a tremendous shock when I walked onto the Duke University campus and blacks were still sitting in the back of the bus and all of that was going on. It was a rude awakening to me. I saw decisions being made that were discriminatory. At any rate, I felt that I sat there for a year and watched this going on, and I said, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to make a difference, you&#x27;re going to have to run as a candidate.&quot; And I got very excited about that, so in 1968, I ran as a Republican, the first political race of my life, and I think lost by 900 votes.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: What was the count of the total? Do you have a round figure?  PATRICIA NEAL: I&#x27;m guessing maybe there were, at that point in time, Kathy, I don&#x27;t know.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: What you&#x27;re saying, am I right, is that must have been a fairly small number of votes? Is that what you&#x27;re implying?  PATRICIA NEAL: Yes. In other words, I came very close to winning. I was sixth out of, they were electing five Board members, so I would have come in, I came in sixth in the balloting and given the number of registered Republicans at that time and given the fact that I was not known in the community at that time, it was a very close race. That was in November of &#x27;68. In June of 1969, the one woman on the Board of Education had a serious disagreement with her fellow Board members over some contracts to buy mobile units, and she felt like there was some hanky panky going on and got very upset, and in sort of a spontaneous moment said, &quot;I resign,&quot; and before she could even realize what she had done, her four colleagues accepted her resignation and off she went. The process for filling that spot on the Board, bear in mind, she had just been elected in November, so this is six months later, and so she has three and a half years left on her term. The Board is charged with the responsibility of selecting a replacement, and this is going to be, now, a replacement for three and a half years. It so happens that in 1968, the Democratic Party, the precincts had been taken over by, I think that was the Eugene McCarthy era. The precincts, the Durham Democratic precincts, had been taken over by the McCarthy people, and they had wrested the power away from the old line Democrats in Durham. The Board did not want to give the Democratic Executive Committee the power to appoint a replacement, so they decided that they would do it themselves. I had been sitting with that Board for a year. I had run and come in number six on the ballot, so they decided that the fairest thing to do was to appoint me to the unexpired term of Mrs. Marley. So here again was being at the right place at the right time, and then subsequently in 1972, I ran and that was the Nixon election in which the Republicans made momentous gains. In fact, Jim Holshouser was elected Governor, who was the first Republican Governor in this century, and I led the ticket of School Board members and was appointed Chairman and was subsequently appointed to the North Carolina Board of Directors of the North Carolina School Board Association. I served as Chairman on the local Board until &#x27;77 and then stayed on the Board the next ten years and served as Vice-Chairman.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: And your term of office you just completed in &#x27;87. That&#x27;s when you left?  PATRICIA NEAL: Yes. I received, in fact, I ran for the North Carolina House of Representatives against George Miller in 1986 and was in a very bad automobile accident on the second of October in 1986, which was a month before the election, and even at that, and George Miller was a five or six-time incumbent Democrat, and I lost to him by 650 votes out of 14,000 cast. So I think, had I not been taken out of the campaign in the last month, I could have beaten him. After that, I received an appointment from Governor Martin to the State Board of Education, and so I resigned my Durham County Board of Education seat in April of &#x27;87 to go on the State Board.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Are you still serving on the State Board?  PATRICIA NEAL: Yes, I sure am. It&#x27;s an eight year appointment. I&#x27;ll be 108 when it&#x27;s up [Laughter]   KATHRYN NASSTROM: I think what I&#x27;d like to do now, then, with that broad sweep outlined, is to go back to the topic of school desegregation, and I mentioned to you earlier that my interest is both in the critical period when school desegregation took place in Durham. My interest there comes from the fact that I know that the pace and the amount of conflict varied so much in North Carolina depending on which community this took place in. But I also have a second interest in knowing what happened, going back to &#x27;54 and the Brown decision and the Pearsall Plan, and you mentioned earlier that we may even have to go back even before 1954 to really understand the dynamic, so I guess my question at this point would be whichever seems logical to you, to either go as far back as is necessary to tell the story or to describe what happened at the critical time in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, whichever seems more logical to you at this point.  PATRICIA NEAL: Kathy, let&#x27;s start with the chronology of desegregation, and I sort of have to jump into it in the middle when I came into it because I don&#x27;t have a great deal of knowledge of what went on. Really, very little happened in the Durham County schools after Brown except that we went with the schools of choice concept, and I remember my own children, at that point, were in school at Hope Valley Elementary School. I remember that there were a few very brave black youngsters who sought admission at Hope Valley School and were accepted, and I don&#x27;t remember any particular problem about that except that there were not very many black families that were willing to put their children at risk and put them in a distinctly minority situation. It was more comfortable for them to continue to send their children to the black Durham County schools.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Do you remember the year that these first students would have arrived at Hope Valley?  PATRICIA NEAL: I do not because at that point, I was involved only as a parent and was not, did not have any official position, but I would say that it was probably mid 50&#x27;s. That would be my guess. No, mid 60&#x27;s, excuse me.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: So maybe &#x27;63, &#x27;64, &#x27;65?  PATRICIA NEAL: Somewhere in there, yes. But the NAACP had sued the Durham County schools for integration of the schools. The School Board, when I became a member of it, had had an integration plan accepted by the Federal District Court in Greensboro in 1968, which said that the high schools and junior high schools would be integrated in the fall of 1969, and because of space limitations and the need to purchase some mobile units to accomplish integration at the elementary school level, the Federal District Judge in Greensboro had given then a year&#x27;s delay for the integration of the elementary schools. So the elementary schools were to be fully integrated in the fall of 1970. In October, well, let me go back. So the high schools and junior high schools were integrated in the fall of 1969 as the court order directed. I remember thinking at that time, we had three high schools, Southern High School, and Jordan High School, and Northern High School, and based on the principals that were employed in those high schools at that time, I remember speculating in my own mind as to how successful the integration of these high schools would be. There was a lot of discussion in the community that there would be problems at Southern High School because the Southern High School mascot was the rebel, and they use the rebel flag, and there was a lot of concern that that would be, and it was pretty much that the community thought of it as the red neck part of town. There was less concern about Jordan High School because primarily, Jordan High School, over the years, has been attended by pretty affluent families, both black and white. And there the aspirations of the parents are in concert, their expectations of their children, and something like ninety percent of Jordan&#x27;s youngsters go on to four-year colleges and that kind of thing. So there was not much concern about how integration was going to work at Jordan High School because of the backgrounds of the children who went there. And Northern High School, nobody really knew how it would go there. You had quite a mix. But I remember thinking that we had a principal, Sidney Ray, at Southern High School who is probably one of the most sensitive and compassionate people that I know. At the opposite end of the spectrum, at Northern High School, we had one of the toughest, old line, hard-nosed, rigid principals in the system, and I remember thinking to myself, &quot;There will never be a problem at Southern High School because Sidney Ray won&#x27;t let there be a problem. If there&#x27;s going to be a problem, I&#x27;m going to bet it&#x27;s going to be at Northern High School.&quot; We&#x27;ll come back to that in a minute because I need to go back to the chronology of what happened next. At any rate, the high schools and junior high schools were integrated in the fall. Then we had the Alexander vs. Holmes decision out of a court in, I think it was Alabama, in the Circuit Court in Alabama, which said not only will you integrate, but you&#x27;ll do it now. The &quot;all deliberate speed&quot; rationale is over, all deliberate speed is not taking place, and the Supreme Court spoke very forthrightly and Alexander-Holmes said you&#x27;ll do it now. The very next day, the NAACP filed suit in the Court of Appeals in Richmond, and said based on the Alexander-Holmes Decision, we want the elementary schools in Durham integrated now. So the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear the case in December. I believe it was the eighth, and I went with our Board attorney to Richmond, and our whole approach to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was that it would not help any child, black or white, to integrate the schools in the middle of the school year, that it would cause tremendous disruption, whether they be black or white. [Students] form attachments to their teacher. The teacher spends the first three or four months getting to know the children and evaluates them and figures out how they&#x27;re going to teach them, and to undo all that would be a terrible disadvantage to all the children, to play &quot;turn over the fruit basket&quot; in the middle of the year. That was the first case that Clement Haynsworth sat on in the Fourth Circuit Court after he was turned down as a member of the Supreme Court. Remember, he was a Nixon appointee. And, at any rate, despite all of our pleadings, and it was a sincere pleading. It had absolutely nothing to do with trying to drag our feet about integration. Our elementary school plan was already drawn up. It was already in the hands of the Federal District Court in Greensboro, and we had simply been granted one year&#x27;s reprieve for the other half of our school system. At that point, integration in Durham was a fait accompli. There was no resistance to it, but we did argue long and hard. I remember sitting in that Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on the eighth of December with tears rolling down my face because I knew what we were going to be faced with, and to have them sit there and not listen to what we were saying I found to be very cruel. But at the same time, the judge&#x27;s point was that you&#x27;d had fifteen years to accomplish this and you haven&#x27;t done it; don&#x27;t blame us because now kids are going to be made to be uncomfortable. At any rate, before we could get back to Durham the next day, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision was in our attorney&#x27;s office, so there was no doubt in my mind that that decision was made before we ever made the arguments in court on Tuesday.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: I&#x27;d like to stop there for just a minute because it seems that, in each community in North Carolina, there are different points at which emotions ran high or just key moments, and this seems to be one for Durham. How would you say, is there a way to describe how different groups in the community felt about this particular decision? The School Board wanted that extra six months to finish out the school year. Were there other groups in the community that were in favor of that decision?  PATRICIA NEAL: My memory is that, in the first place, I don&#x27;t recall that there was a great deal of objection by the community to integrating the schools at that point in time. I think everybody, well, obviously not everybody, but Durham, you have to remember, is such a cosmopolitan community, and it had very, very, as it has always had, significant black leadership. It&#x27;s been noted for that, not only in North Carolina, but really all over the country, with North Carolina Mutual being the largest black-owned insurance company in the world and North Carolina Central and Duke University and the large number of people who had been brought into the Durham community. It&#x27;s almost hard to find somebody who is a native Durhamite. There have been a lot of people who have come into this community who gave it a flavor different from other North Carolina communities where I think the resistance to integration was a lot stronger, and there was a great deal more resistance and very ugly confrontations than there were in Durham. But when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals came down, and here we are right before Christmas, and that decision is that, the order was that the schools will be integrated after Christmas. Here we are with the kids ready to get out for Christmas. The teachers are all going home out of state, out of the city. It means that all the children, all the teachers&#x27; equipment, books, everything has to be shuffled during the Christmas vacation. The Board went into a meeting Tuesday afternoon when we got back from Richmond, and although most of the work on the integration of elementary schools had already been done, we still had to finish it and fine tune it, and it had to be, the court demanded that that plan be in the Federal District Court in Greensboro by the following Monday afternoon. So we met for twelve hours at a time Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, because the secretary to the attorney then had to get the descriptions of the school districts, and we&#x27;re talking about fourteen elementary schools, and the boundaries had to be drawn around those schools and that meant that you had to have a description like &quot;the boundary for Pearsontown will be from thirty-two degrees north along the railroad tracks to on and on.&quot; So it was going to take the secretary the whole weekend to type it, so we met in constant sessions. The community went berserk, I&#x27;ll tell you that. My phone did not stop ringing. I met with groups. They wanted me to go to jail. They wanted the Board to be in contempt of Court. They did not want this order carried out, and it took every effort by the members of that Board to convince the community and to lower the level of hostility in the community to get them to understand that the Board did not have a choice, that the schools were going to be integrated on the third of January whether the Board did it or not and that, I remember saying that if I could go to jail and take a contempt of Court citation if it would make a difference, I would the willing to do that, but the fact was that either the Board was going to make this decision or the Federal Court was going to make this decision and that, after all, what we&#x27;re trying to do is protect the children and that it would be best for the children if we made that decision about who was going to draw boundary lines rather than leave it to the Federal District Court.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: It was going to happen one way of the other.  PATRICIA NEAL: It was going to happen one way of the other. Once the community understood that, and it took a lot of talking and a lot of meetings with community groups to get people settled down, but once they understood that we did not have a choice then, in retrospect, Kathy, it was the best thing that could have happened. Because we went in, we made the decisions, we drew the boundary lines, we said this is the way it&#x27;s got to be. And then over the Christmas vacation, parents that I had never seen in the schools before came together, and they went out to those schools, and they helped move furniture and notify teachers and send out letters to students about where their assignment was. The whole community just sort of regrouped and said, &quot;OKAY. The kids are what&#x27;s important here. Let&#x27;s get it done.&quot; We opened school on the third of January.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  PATRICIA NEAL: So at any rate, the schools opened successfully on January 3, and that meant that the integration was complete, and it went extremely well until the spring of that year when the racial tensions began to run high at Northern High School. At that point in time, there was a black member of the School Board, who was Dr. Phil Cousins, and he was the last, well, I say the last black member. There has been one since, Dr. Richard Hunter, who has gone to Baltimore, I think, but at that point, Dr. Phil Cousins, who was the Pastor of St. Joseph&#x27;s AME Zion Church. He was a very, very competent, very able black man who was extremely important that spring in keeping a potentially disastrous situation from getting out of hand. But, as I had indicated earlier, the principal at Northern High School was simply unable to deal with the realities of integration, and the black students … less had been done at Northern High School in preparation for integration than at the other two high schools. At the other two high schools, there had been open houses, trying to bring the black students into the high school prior to the opening of school, decisions being made about cheerleaders and Student Council representation. The guidance counselors had been involved at the other two high schools. In other words, there had been a fair amount of ground work done by the administration in the Guidance Departments at Southern and at Jordan. Very little had been done at Northern High School, so I was not surprised when trouble erupted there.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: What, in particular, happened? Just a brief description.  PATRICIA NEAL: It&#x27;s a little bit hazy in my mind except that the black community was complaining that the black students at Northern High School were not being treated fairly. Discipline was not being administered even-handedly. There may have been some questions about cheer leaders. At any rate, the perception in the black community was that the black students were not being treated fairly. I remember that the Board decided to meet at Northern High School with the black students and listen to their concerns, over the objections of the Superintendent of Schools, who felt that the Board was getting into administration. But I remember feeling very strongly at the time that if the Board did not do something to defuse that situation that it was going to get out of hand and that we were going to wind up with some very serious problems on our hands. By that time, I had been elected Chairman, and I remember that there was a rumor that they were going, the blacks were going to show up at Carrington the next day and cut the white girls&#x27; hair. And rumors were running rampant that the whites were going to retaliate. The head of the Klan in northern Durham County called me and said, &quot;We&#x27;re going with guns to Carrington tomorrow,&quot; and I really think that that&#x27;s the one time that I can remember that being a woman probably helped the situation, because I remember begging him to give me three days to get the situation under control, and I assured him that it would be under control. At that same time, I was talking with Phil Cousins, and he had the black community in hand, and he was counseling with them and saying, &quot;Give us three days. We will have the situation in hand. The concerns of the black students at Northern High School will be addressed. We are working on them, but for God&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s not have violence. We will get these concerns taken care of.&quot; And we did, but I&#x27;ve often thought, when I was talking to that Klan member, that if I had been another man, he&#x27;d have probably told me to go to hell, and they&#x27;d have arrived the next day with guns, and we&#x27;d have had a loss of life. But I think that he just maybe felt sorry for me or was willing to give me the benefit of the doubt or something, but everybody sort of kept their cool and allowed the Board to go in and meet with the students and meet with the faculty and get the concerns addressed. That was the only hint of trouble that we ever had in the whole integration process. That was over in about a week.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: That was actually my next question—how long it took for this issue to defuse. What was press coverage like during this week-long period? Did it help? Did it hinder?  PATRICIA NEAL: My recollection would be that they were helpful, that they were not inflammatory, that they tried to get balanced coverage, and it was, I&#x27;m sure, thoroughly covered. It would be interesting to go back now and read those articles, but I remember them being more helpful than anything else.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: You mentioned, too, this Phil Cousins, and I&#x27;m wondering if there are other groups or other individuals that were important in resolving this conflict.  PATRICIA NEAL: Prior to that, in fact in 1968, Fred McNeil had been elected to the Board, and Fred was also a black gentleman who, Is think, was very helpful in moving the Board along in their integration, dealings with integration. Then Fred McNeil became Director of Operation Breakthrough, and because of the Hatch Act, he had to resign from the Board, and that&#x27;s when Phil Cousins was appointed to the Board, but after Phil Cousins left to go to Birmingham, there has not been another black member who has been elected to the Durham County Board of Education.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Does that have anything to do with the change in demographics between the county schools and the city schools of Durham?  PATRICIA NEAL: Yes and no. It has to do with the change in the election laws that took place in 1976 in which the Board went from a partisan Board to a non-partisan Board, and part of that package, which had to be approved by the General Assembly—it was special enabling legislation that moved us from a partisan Board to a non-partisan Board—and part of that package was that all five members would be elected at one time for a four-year term and that they would be elected only by the Durham, that you had to live in the Durham County school district to vote. When that happened, there is a much larger number of black voters in the city than there are in the county. The county schools are about, then they were about eighty-twenty, and now they are about seventy-thirty, white to black. Conversely, the Durham city schools are about ninety percent black, ten percent white. So when that package was enacted, it was extraordinarily difficult, given the voter registration in the Durham County school system, for a black to be elected.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: When we were talking earlier, you mentioned that there&#x27;s a history, before &#x27;69 and before you came on the board, that&#x27;s important here. I&#x27;d like, to the best of your recollection, to fill that in and tell us what&#x27;s important. But before we do that, do you think there&#x27;s more of the story post-1972 that&#x27;s important to record?  PATRICIA NEAL: I don&#x27;t think so, except that in 1973, when I was Chairman, Mr. Chewning, who had been the Superintendent for twenty-three years, his health had deteriorated, and he was a Southern gentleman from South Carolina and the whole integration [process] was more then he could deal with. After he retired, we then hired Dr. Frank Yeager, who cam from the Louisville, Kentucky, school system and who was an enormously talented and very, very sensitive administrator. Frank Yeager was here from &#x27;73 to &#x27;83, and I think much of the progress that we continue to make in race relations and improving the quality of the Durham County schools rests with the decision to hire that man. He was absolutely phenomenal. That&#x27;s a whole other story, too, because he was, a chapter in his career was as a Secret Service Agent to President Kennedy, so there are lots of interesting stories that we don&#x27;t have time to go into today because they&#x27;re not really relevant except that his background was so varied and that he just brought tremendous leadership. Your question goes back to the Durham City and County schools. There was a history, back in the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s, if you didn&#x27;t go to the Durham City system, you just were a nobody. Anybody who was anybody in Durham went to Durham High. That was the school to go to and be a graduate of. The Durham County schools were very poor, very rural, and just didn&#x27;t begin to have the reputation for academic excellence that the Durham City Schools had. After the integration of the schools, and at the same time that the Durham County schools were under court order, the Durham City schools were also under court order to integrate, and I think the population at that point was probably about, maybe fifty-fifty in the Durham City schools. When integration came, you had tremendous white, not only white flight out of the city schools, but middle and upper income black flight as well. Consequently, the Durham City schools have been left as practically every other city system in the United States has been left, and that is that they&#x27;re very poor and very black, very economically deprived, and they&#x27;ve gone from being fifty-fifty back in 1970 to now being ninety-ten. We tried very hard in 1972 to, we had a merger vote then, but that was right after the horrendous fight in Charlotte-Mecklenberg and the forced bussing in that community, and when we said &quot;merger&quot; they said &quot;Charlotte-Mecklenberg,&quot; and we tried to point out to the community that Durham County was not in any way, shape or form like Charlotte-Mecklenberg, and it was beaten worse in &#x27;72 than it&#x27;s ever been beaten before. Interestingly enough, it was beaten worse in the city precincts than it was in the county precincts, and I think at that time, the black community recognized that they were headed toward controlling their own school system, and they subsequently elected a majority black Board and have had, now, two black Superintendents. In the recent merger task force discussions by the Durham committee, Willie Lovett and some of the other leaders, George Reed, spoke very eloquently of the loss of power and control that the city system would face if they merged because by law, the county system becomes the government system, and they would, in essence, be swallowed up unless some very, very strict guidelines were drawn up about representation on the board and how the people in the city system in administrative positions would be treated in a merged system, what their future would be.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: That&#x27;s interesting. The merger question is in the papers now, and it&#x27;s interesting to see how far back it goes and how some of the exact same issues were in place seventeen years ago.  PATRICIA NEAL: In 1972, the last time we had a vote on it, the very same issues that have been raised this year on the Merger Task Force were raised then, and I don&#x27;t see any differences except that logistically, with the fifty-fifty black population in Durham City, it would have been a whole lot easier to get a reasonable racial balance in the schools in 1972 than it&#x27;s going to be today.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: What&#x27;s your position on this and has it changed in the seventeen year period? Did you think differently about this issue in &#x27;72 than you do now?  PATRICIA NEAL: I was very much pro-merger in 1972. I worked long and hard to effect a merger then because I think it could have been done successfully then. My position has changed only in that given the racial distribution of students and the fact that you would have to have, and I think the courts would demand that you have, some reasonable kind of racial balance. The disparity in the two systems just about where black and white kids live would mean a horrendous amount of bussing, and the quality of the education in the city system has declined, I think, dramatically while it&#x27;s gone up dramatically in the county system. The disparity, quite frankly, in the leadership in the Durham city system, the quality of the leadership is poor. They refuse to bite the bullet on personnel. When they&#x27;ve got a principal who can&#x27;t cut it, they bring him into the central office. Up until last year, they had the highest per capita, highest per student, expenditure in the state of North Carolina, and they&#x27;ve got the highest administrative per pupil ratio in the state. Every time they&#x27;ve had any difficult situation with a black administrator, they pull him out of a principalship and find a place for him in the central office. They just are unwilling to bite the leadership bullet, and a merger now would mean that you&#x27;re going to sacrifice the county kids for however many years it takes to straighten out the mess. I think, eventually, it&#x27;s probably going to come, but it&#x27;s going to be at the sacrifice of the county kids, and that&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s going to be chaos, just chaos. It&#x27;s a tough one.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Yes, it definitely is. The article that sticks in my mind is the one that was in The Independent, now maybe about six weeks ago, six or eight weeks ago, that tried to look at it from the perspective of the parents and the kids that would be involved. It did some interviews for the background of it, and I think that it really showed the complexity of the issue.  PATRICIA NEAL: It&#x27;s not going to be easy, and there may be some thought about seeing if the new city Superintendent can bring some order out of chaos, can move the two systems a little closer together in parity so that the shock of trying to merge the two systems won&#x27;t be as great five years down the road as it is today. I don&#x27;t know.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: It seems, though, that still the ideal in your mind is to arrive at that point.  PATRICIA NEAL: I think so. I think that ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have a community with a split school system, and gradually this is happening across the state. We used to have 170 school systems when I first came on the Board in &#x27;69, and now we&#x27;re down to about 129. So slowly, but surely, across the state, communities are coming to recognize that it is not financially practical to operate two or three school systems. Of course, the classic is the one in Robeson County, where they have seven in one county, but it&#x27;s a problem that needs to be solved locally, at the grass roots level because the people who are going to be involved in it are the ones who are going to have make it work. There&#x27;s been some talk of having the state mandate 100 county systems, and I think that would be a big mistake.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: You&#x27;re making these comments about North Carolina, and I think about a transition here to your service on the State Board of Education. Maybe a good starting point would be these kinds of questions or issues that you see in the dynamics in Durham, and now you&#x27;re looking at the entire state. What kinds of issues to you, since you&#x27;ve come on the Board, seem to be the big issues for public education in North Carolina now?  PATRICIA NEAL: Well, I think the big issue of accountability and flexibility is what they&#x27;re talking about in Raleigh today, and at the same time one of the things that I do bring to the State Board is that having been on a local board, I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of some mandates from the State Board and from the General Assembly, which frequently come to the local without sufficient funds to implement them. I think too often the General Assembly and the State Board, where they have had people that have not had local board experience, they tend to make state wide decisions without thinking about what the impact is going to be at the local level, and that&#x27;s something as a State Board member that I&#x27;m very sensitive to. A good example is class size. The General Assembly heard from some system, I&#x27;ve forgotten where it was, where some teacher had 65 students in the class. Now, obviously, that was a very poor decision by some administrator in that county. Well, the General Assembly tends to get all excited about those things. So they passed a class size mandate, said you can only have 26 kids in a class. Well, what that means is children don&#x27;t come in evenly allocated slots of 26 to a class. The state demands that, after ten days, every class must have 26 students. Well, that means that many of the schools have got to play turn over the fruit basket, after ten days of school, to either hire additional teachers or create combination classes so that they meet the state class size mandate. Now, that&#x27;s stupidity. All because the General Assembly heard about one or two bad situations in a local district. But I think you do see a very different perspective from the State Board, and I&#x27;ve spent the first two years literally traveling from Murphy to Manteo. I think I was very insulated in the Durham County system in that I had seen the best. You know, we used local money to hire elementary school guidance counselors back in 1973, and they&#x27;re just now hiring under the Basic Education Plan elementary school counselors in many of the school systems across the state, and I could go on and on with examples of that, where we&#x27;d have such tremendous progressive thinking about what we needed to do in Durham County. And you go out in Northhampton County or you go to Swain County in the mountains or some of the little counties in between that don&#x27;t have the kind of tax base that Durham County has and you see some really poor educational quality.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: And one thing that money comes into play.  PATRICIA NEAL: Absolutely no question about it. We have not begun to get the resources into the state that we need.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: That&#x27;s such a big challenge, in this day and age, getting money for education. Off the top of your head, what are other challenges that you see coming along, or where the money to be there for some of these programs, what most needs attention in North Carolina now?  PATRICIA NEAL: Well, obviously the high dropout rate is a critical problem in North Carolina. That, in my opinion, is related to the need for early childhood education. The whole society is just changed and children are being put in inadequate daycare because they&#x27;re either single parent families or both parents have to work. And the child is six months old and he&#x27;s put in daycare, and we have poor quality daycare and these children arrive in kindergarten without anywhere near the skills that they need to start school. And there&#x27;s been an extraordinarily interesting study done in Ypsilanti, Michigan which is now 18 years old so they&#x27;ve had some time to follow-up and they figure for every dollar invested in three and four year olds that you&#x27;re saving seven dollars on the other end in jailfare and welfare and those kinds of things. And I think ultimately that&#x27;s the answer to the dropout problem because most of these kids never drop-in to begin with. And the quality of the teachers is directly related to the student achievement. You know, when we&#x27;re paying starting teachers $18,000 a year, there&#x27;s no way in God&#x27;s green earth that we&#x27;re going to attract the best and the brightest teachers into the teaching profession, let alone keep them after we get them. That&#x27;s true not only in North Carolina but nationwide, you know. We&#x27;ve got to get our priorities straight. When I read that the average major league baseball player earns $500,000 a year, and we&#x27;re playing our teachers $18,000, you know. What can you say about our commitment to public education? Not much. Not that we can afford to pay them $500,000, but let&#x27;s get serious folks.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: All of this sounds so grim, and it is right now, what do you see as the possibilities for change in the near future or the long term?  PATRICIA NEAL: I&#x27;m optimistic. I really am, but then I tend to be an optimist and see the glass half-full instead of half-empty. But practically every article that you read in the newspaper related to the General Assembly has to do with education. The governor has made a very bold proposal for an increase of 1% in sales tax, and his surveys indicate, and I would certainly agree with that based on the number of bond issues for school construction that passed in North Carolina in the last two years, [the response] has been very, very positive. I don&#x27;t know what the actual percentage is but it&#x27;s extraordinarily high. The governor&#x27;s surveys indicated that if the people could be assured that that 1% would go into a public education fund like the highway fund, that they would be willing to pay that extra 1%. The other very encouraging thing is that for the first time business and industry has gotten seriously involved. And it&#x27;s not all, what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for, not just out of the goodness of their hearts.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: It&#x27;s partly self interest.  PATRICIA NEAL: It&#x27;s self interest and survival. And that&#x27;s okay. Whatever the reason is.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: You&#x27;ll take the money where you can get it.  PATRICIA NEAL: We&#x27;ll take the money and the interest. And I think the partnerships that are being formed, not only in North Carolina but across the nation, are very, very helpful because they literally cannot find people to be employed.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: I can&#x27;t help thinking as you described this, something that I don&#x27;t think I mentioned to you earlier, but in the other set of interviews I&#x27;m doing, I spoke with Grace Rohrer about her work. And a lot of what you&#x27;re saying now seems to me to be the kinds of issues that she was concerned about in the work that she&#x27;s doing out at Appalachian State now. This is coming somewhat out of the blue, but I mentioned to you my interest generally in women and politics or women who are activists, and it seemed easy to make the connection—education, children, these are women&#x27;s issues, these are women&#x27;s concerns. Do you think along those lines? Is that what motivates you or is there some other, what would be the word, maybe, wellspring, for the kind of work that you&#x27;re doing now in this very long commitment, twenty years, to education?  PATRICIA NEAL: Well, you know, I guess I don&#x27;t see it primarily as a woman&#x27;s issue, Kathy, I really don&#x27;t. I see it being motivated by a, really a lifetime of public service, commitment to trying to leave this world a little better than I found it, and one of the things that I feel very strongly about is that I have never felt discriminated against as a woman, and I was elected to a school board and then elected chairman by four men at a time when there were very few women on school boards across this county and in North Carolina in particular. And then to be elected chairman was, you know, there were only three or four of us in North Carolina at that time that were chairman of our respective boards. And then I got into real estate, which when I got into that was, you know, in the mid-70s, was a very much male-dominated profession. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky in the people that I have worked with, just really never thought about discriminating against a woman. But I&#x27;ve found every entry into that arena extraordinarily satisfying and free of any bias and prejudice against women. It&#x27;s been a very fulfilling experience.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: I would think so. And part of the reason I asked the questions that way is that I read just recently that in terms of women either appointed or elected to government positions, whether it be on the local level or nationally, that education has been one avenue into politics for women, meaning the whole service kinds of things, and that women have made the most progress, being highest representation, on school boards, committees. That that&#x27;s really been a place of advancement for women in politics.  PATRICIA NEAL: Well, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right. Again, it&#x27;s kind of a natural because of the early involvement of mothers with the schools and, I think, much broader appreciation of the issues.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Well, I looked through my notes and we&#x27;ve covered most of ground that I had wanted to. Is there something else that you&#x27;d want to add to what we&#x27;ve said so far or anything in the way of clarification?  PATRICIA NEAL: I don&#x27;t think so. I think we&#x27;ve pretty much gone through it.  KATHRYN NASSTROM: Thanks very much. I appreciate your time.  PATRICIA NEAL: You&#x27;re very welcome.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>C-l-5 Interview with JAMES M. BALEY.. JR. November 22, 19 88 By Jonathan Houghton The Southern Oral History Program University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Original transcript en deposit at The Southern Historical Collection Louis Round Wilson Library Copyright c 1990 The University of North Carolina 1 START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A: [Interview with James Baley by Jonathan Houghton - November 22, 1988] JAMES BALEY: I remember speaking for Lou Rogers over the radio there in Charlotte, and I remember we put the first State Convention on television that had ever been put on here in this state and, as far as I know, anywhere. JONATHAN HOUGHTON:  Was that in 1950 or 1952? JB: That was in &#x27;50. Then the next time, we put the state headquarters there in Charlotte. Eisenhower, I had been very much interested in the Eisenhower campaign. I was present with the leaders at the Chicago convention to pick Nixon when he was named at the Blackstone Hotel for recommendation to Eisenhower for selection as vice presidential nominee. JH: Was there a lot of resentment to Nixon there at that time? JB: Oh no, no, no. Nixon was riding the crest of a wave there. JH: I understand Eisenhower later thought about kicking him off, and then he had to make the Checkers Speech. I didn&#x27;t know if there was any resentment in that. JB: Well, they didn&#x27;t have the part that led to the Checkers thing at that time. That was at the convention and, generally speaking, as Bush did this time, the delegates accede to the wishes of the presidential candidate who wins. That was a convention from which there will be no other like it. It was a fight between Taft and Eisenhower.   When Eisenhower won, Mr. 2 Broyhill, who was our National Committeeman, was for Taft. And indeed, I liked Taft, but I was wanting to win, and I was for Eisenhower. Mr. DeLapp was the official leader of the Eisenhower wing, but I was the State Chairman. Broyhill was the National Committeeman, and Mr. Patton, Frank Patton, was Taft&#x27;s leader. Well now, I tell you all that to get you to how I got so involved in it that I became one of the floor leaders for certain districts under the supervision of Sherman Adams at the convention. The thing was handled so efficiently. We&#x27;d meet at certain times all during that controversy about delegates and keeping up with who was for Taft and who was for Eisenhower. When the report was made before the last vote was taken, we had that figured so closely that there was only about two votes difference in what our calculations were and what we actually got. JH:  And you got twelve votes from the delegates there? JB: We got twelve for Eisenhower and fourteen for Taft in North Carolina. JH: But those twelve votes for Eisenhower were twelve of the most remarkable changes and remarkable political effort probably in the history of the North Carolina Republican Party. JB: Well, we did a great deal of work. I ran all over the state on that thing. I was State Chairman, but I was also extremely interested in DeLapp and his side. I suppose he was officially the fellow, but I was the one that really would run it.  I was the head of our delegation. JH:  He didn&#x27;t go to Chicago or anything. 3 JB: No, he was not, they didn&#x27;t elect him as a delegate. That was one of the things at our state convention that we couldn&#x27;t get done.  Taft was stronger in the Party organization. JH: What sort of people favored Taft? Was it the local politicians, the local County Chairmen? Obviously, Broyhill and his friends were close. JB: It was established Party structure with the exception of some of the more progressive thinkers like DeLapp, and I suppose you would put me in that category. I was the chairman, and we had an element who was interested in winning. Nobody was hostile among our organization to Taft. Taft was one of the greatest men that I have ever met, but we were simply afraid that he was not going to make it to handle that. JH: He wouldn&#x27;t win the Democratic vote, the Independent vote, the youth? JB: That&#x27;s right. There was a great variety of reasons because he had been a very strong leader in the Senate, and he was, Eisenhower was, a very popular hero. It looked like whoever nominated him, if they had, they would have won. So it was just a question of that. In any event, after the vote was cast--I&#x27;m going a long way around to tell you this story--several of us were called. I was one of the number. Of course Dewey and Brownell, and governors from two or three of the states who were for Eisenhower, and several of the other Party people, members of the National Committee were called to that hotel. I think it was the Blackstone Hotel at Chicago. And we were there. He had told Brownell, who was his contact man, to come up with the name of 4 the Vice President, who they wanted, who would be the man for Vice President. They met there, and it was very interesting. I didn&#x27;t do much contributing to the discussion, but when we heard talk of people, they took up various names. Taft was one, see, they took up. JH:  Why did they decide against Taft? JB: Nothing except that if he was elected, they&#x27;d lose their strongest man in the Senate, and we&#x27;d lose a Republican vote in the Senate to a Democrat, appointed by the Governor of Ohio, and we&#x27;d lose the vote. There was nothing of any personal note. JH:  Did they think Taft would be a drag on the ticket? JB: Oh no, not now. That wasn&#x27;t it. He was very strong. It was just the technical thing to try to get our best for the Party. They went through the lot, and Dewey was the one that proposed Nixon. I think they would have all thought about Nixon, but they were leading up to it. Dewey proposed and made his little pitch for Nixon. He said that Nixon had made the address at their big Lincoln Day dinner in New York where they have so many events, big events, and that he was a most articulate and effective spokesman. He was the best speaker on the national scene, and he was young. He was connected with this anti-Communist thing, along with this Whittaker Chambers mess that was going on at that time. So, eventually they ended up, and everybody voted for him, and I sat there while Brownell went in and called Eisenhower and told him who had been selected. JH:  What an honor. 5 JB:  Well, you don&#x27;t ever know about those things, and he. . JH:  So what did Eisenhower think? JB: Eisenhower checked it and said great. Said he wanted somebody who was connected with the anti-Communist drive, and he wanted someone who would be an effective speaker and conduct a vigorous campaign.  He wanted a young man. JH: Did he ever consider Joe McCarthy? I mean, he was the Republican the most renowned for his anti-Communist message. JB:  No, never.  Joe was in a matter of disrepute by then. JH:  So was Nixon a kind of a means to control? JB: Nixon just had a good reputation for fighting Communism, but doing it in a proper fashion. He was a very excellent spokesman. He was young enough to make a very vigorous campaign, and that&#x27;s what Eisenhower wanted. They selected him but that&#x27;s off the point. That&#x27;s something that Kevin Phillips wrote four volumes about, which I&#x27;ve got at home. JH:  Emerging Republican Majority? JB: Well, he wrote that. But I think they wrote a story of the convention. It was four or five volumes of that. I&#x27;ve got it at home. I believe it was Phillips that did the writing. He went into detail, told all the votes, and how things were. That was a great convention, but I&#x27;m getting over on something else. JH: No, this is a very interesting point. One thing I&#x27;m very interested in is the 1952 campaign in North Carolina, or the Republican campaign for the presidential candidate, Eisenhower 6 versus Taft divisions. With Sim DeLapp, of course, representing the Eisenhower wing and Broyhill representing the Taft wing. JB:  Patton was the. . . . JH:  Official manager? JB: Yes, he was the officially named manager, but Broyhill was the key man. Broyhill was extremely influential at that time and knew Taft personally so well. He&#x27;d been down to his home and all that, and, indeed, nobody had anything against Taft. So, I mean, the Party was strong in their like of Taft. JH: Well, Sim DeLapp talked about how he spent a lot of money giving contributions to Taft&#x27;s 1950 re-election campaign in Ohio, and there had been a lot of support that way. But he also says that there was a lot of bitterness there between the two wings, and it became very divisive. JB:  Well, it was. JH: Broyhill, apparently, used tactics that poisoned a lot of people against Eisenhower. They portrayed Eisenhower as a Democrat, or maybe even a Socialist, or just tried any technique available to. . . . JB: Well, my memories cruise over those things. Sim was more, I guess, concerned with that. I never got into, I never considered any acrimony or bitterness concerning Taft. I was a strong supporter of Taft in most of his endeavors. I was not bitter in any way in connection with it. I simply wanted the other man because I thought he was the most effective candidate. I was much younger than Broyhill. Broyhill died recently. I think he was ninety.  I was probably twenty, twenty-five years 7 younger than Broyhill was. I was comparatively young. I was about, I&#x27;d say about forty years, something like that. I will admit that the campaign was very bitterly contested. It was contested, and anybody that changed, nearly was a renegade of the first order. I went all over the state to see the delegates after they were selected, and they were bitter in not approving. I remember that they were, the Taft people appeared to be in control of the convention. In the election of the delegates at large it was customary that the National Committeemen and the National Committee women, the State Chairman, and the candidate for Governor be the four, and the four of us were nominated. Mrs. Few and I were elected. She was the president&#x27;s wife, the president of Duke University. Broyhill was elected, and Chub Sewell was our candidate for governor. He was defeated by Green, Clyde Greene. They sent two Taft and two Eisenhower people as the delegates at large. JH: How did they manage to appoint someone other than the gubernatorial candidate, Chub Sewell, that year, as a delegate? JB: They just ran against him, and they nominated him. You had to elect him at the Convention. They just nominated Greene against him, and they had enough to win. They didn&#x27;t have too much, but they. . . . JH: Well, they&#x27;d also both been running for governor, right, and Sewell was nominated as the gubernatorial candidate. But then he lost the election for delegate. Is that how it worked, or. . . . 8 JB: Well, I don&#x27;t think there was a serious contest for governor. I think they wanted Sewell. Everybody wanted Sewell for governor, but they knew that that meant a vote for Eisenhower. That Chub was for Eisenhower, and they didn&#x27;t want that. So even with Chub being the candidate that had been designated, and was going to run for governor, by the Convention, they ran Greene against him, purely on the Eisenhower/Taft end of it, not a matter of which one they liked particularly. One was for Eisenhower and one was for Taft. It was a vote of about, oh, I&#x27;d say, five, six hundred maybe for Greene, and about five hundred for Seawell. It was a fairly close, a very close thing. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t have been elected. At that time, I was reasonably popular within the Party, I would say. I was State Chairman, and they put me in, and they put Mrs. Few, but Chub just didn&#x27;t make it.  That&#x27;s all. JH:  Was he upset over that? JB: Oh no. Chub, I suppose he was upset but not in any bitter way. I remember Chub saying that he got Eisenhower in there as a nominee, and he was going to run with Ike in the driver&#x27;s seat and him in the rumble seat there. [Laughter] That&#x27;s when they had cars with a rumble seat. I will admit that my memory is dim about the bitterness of that campaign. I know it was strong, and some of the fellows fell out. There were some things said that were fairly cutting. But I never let that, I don&#x27;t think it ever affected me that much. Now, I don&#x27;t mean I wasn&#x27;t strong. I remember some of the delegates that I went down to eastern Carolina to see and talk with.  We took them, a group 9 of them, to see Eisenhower when he was President at Columbia. Went up and had a special conference with our delegates that we could take up there before the convention. I know that we did a lot, and they. . . . JH:  Did you take all of the delegates up there? JB:  All who would go.  They were all invited. JH: How many did actually go to see Eisenhower, of the twenty-six? JB: I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve got a picture somewhere showing the group of the delegates taken with Eisenhower before the convention up there at Columbia. JH: Did Eisenhower, did his personality and his stance on issues, which had been a little vague, persuade some people that they shouldn&#x27;t support him? JB: Well, not so much his stand, particularly, but he was a very genial, pleasant gentleman, and he would make little talks to them. I remember somebody asked him about his farm program in the group that was seen before we were. They got somebody answering all the farm things. He didn&#x27;t know anything about it. See, he knew nothing about any farm programs. They didn&#x27;t want him quizzed on that, and we arranged to get him out. So we didn&#x27;t get in that, but it was managed so that it was not probed. Of course, they had the press all around every time, and the darn things, if you do it, you do it privately. JH:  Oh, it wasn&#x27;t privately. JB: Oh no, well, private in the sense that they went in the private room, but the press was right there, and they were asking 10 each one of them that came out to say various things, and what they thought about programs. They are so knowledgeable about, the press is, about the key items that are in controversy that they could embarrass very much. I, you must remember, my God, that&#x27;s forty years ago. JH:  That&#x27;s a long time. JB: Yes, I&#x27;m trying to reconstruct a little of this. But some of it is very vivid. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I never lost my liking for Taft. I&#x27;ve made many speeches introducing him down here as &quot;Horatio Standing at the Bridge&quot; to keep the influx of this New Deal legislation from overwhelming us. That kind of stuff. Sim was a little more emotional and a little less discreet in some of his language. He was a Dewey man and had always been a Dewey man. JH:  Why was he attracted to Dewey? JB: He wanted to win the election, and he just thought that Dewey was more colorful and had a more colorful background, and that Taft simply was tied to what they called the &quot;Old Guard&quot; and would not be able to make it. Sim was, I suppose, as far as we would go, a liberal. But he, in most eyes, would be really a conservative in today&#x27;s world. I worked under, you see, getting back to how I had any contact to Sim, he was my mentor, practically, in going into the state field. Where I got my indoctrination into the Republican politics was in Madison County. I went to the legislature a couple of times from Madison County. When I went down there in 1937, it was just an extra hand.    There had been  a Democratic  representative  in  the 1 i legislature from Madison County. They had elected a Democratic legislator, which was not their normal voting pattern. He had gone down there and created a series of commissions, Health Board, named three Democrats on that Health Board. Tax Commission, named three Democrats on that Tax Commission. Jury Commission, named three on that, and anything practically that was in the governing pattern of the county that the County Commissioners normally handled, except levying the tax, he had distributed to various commissions, all of whom were appointed as Democrats. JH: So the net effect would be that in Raleigh, the legislature was determining who would make decisions for Madison County. That would not happen in any of the other hundred North Carolina counties, which was because Madison was Republican. JB:  Madison was strongly Republican and (                        ) Now when I tell you about the Health Board, Tax Commission, Jury Commission, oh, I don&#x27;t know, one or two others maybe, he made the chairmen of those commissions and, by the way they were self-perpetuating boards, gave them the right to elect tax collectors, elect the auditor, and to do various things in connection with the operation of the county, which came by taking it away from the elected Republicans. They were electing their tax collector and other officers. JH:  And also from the citizens who then couldn&#x27;t elect. JB: Oh, of course, from the citizens. The county was about, I don&#x27;t know, sixty-forty or more, I guess, maybe Republicans.  [After he went down, that was fall of course, but 12 he passed the Superior Court Judge here for a long period of time.] Bill McLean, who was elected later as a Superior Court Judge, was a lawyer then, and he was from Polk County. He had helped the Democratic representative in 1931 in arranging this, and they had just taken away, in effect, all of the control of Madison County from the hands of the people and the voters of the people who had nothing to do with it. I went down there. They&#x27;d been struggling against that. That was in the election of &#x27;31 he did that. In 1933, I came to practice law in Madison County. I had grown up in Madison County through most of the grammar school. My father was working then in Asheville as a Chief Deputy Marshal, so we had moved up here. I had finished high school in Asheville. Then I had gone on to Mars Hill and Carolina and the Law School at Carolina and finished the Law School at Carolina and then I came back. I went to practice law in 1933, in June, 1933. Well, I began to learn what was happening down there. I had been in a Republican family there. I&#x27;d been raised as a Republican practically. I was only twenty-one then, see, when I went down there to practice. I got very quickly. . . . JH:  Pretty quick, yes. JB: I had made speeches while I was down at Chapel Hill. I had been on the Debate team. I travelled to Harvard, to Boston College, and out to Texas, and down to New Orleans. I&#x27;d travelled around all over eastern America nearly with the debate team, and I was fairly articulate. So when I came in there to practice law, of course, I wasn&#x27;t doing anything, but people 13 began to talk to me. And I began to find out what the situation was, and I&#x27;d read about it in Madison County. First, in 1934, was my first experience in Madison County, going out and campaigning throughout the county. We&#x27;d had a string band, and we went to the various places and made speeches, travelled all over the county. I was one of their speakers, and I knew that I would become much better known and better acquainted, and after all, I was interested in developing a practice, law practice. Well, in the course of that, my father was a strong Republican, and he had been sheriff of the county at one time down there, in fact, in 1917, during the war years. So I began to acquire lots of contacts throughout the county, and our Republican organization was not too strong. So what I did was get a group of the younger people who were more active, and we formed a Young Republican Organization. I was elected Chairman of the Republican Organization, of the Young Republican Organization. Well, the Young Republican Organization, in so far as any work and power and influence, simply, we didn&#x27;t have it. The others were still there in name, but the work took place in the precincts and so forth and was the Young Republican effort. So in 1936 when Landon ran for President against Roosevelt, we lost everything but the name pretty much, you remember. I was nominated in the primary for the House of Representatives and was elected in the fall there. I served in the 1937 legislature. Well, my prime objective, as I had told them all the time, was to get rid of all these laws that were keeping us hamstrung 14 and not allowing anyone in the county, except the people who were fostered by the Democratic Party. They were the ones who were running it, you see, the Jury Commission, and unfortunately, running it in such a terrible fashion. They went through and they picked the jury lists. We&#x27;d get juries there, when we were predominantly Republican, that were ten to two Democratic and had an awful lot of. . . . JH: In those days, you couldn&#x27;t dismiss certain members because they were biased? JB: Oh, but I&#x27;m talking the whole panel was that way. It wasn&#x27;t a matter, you picked the panel by the, the Jury Commission picked the panel. They picked the ones that went in the jury box, and they picked the ones that came out. And when we got the jury list, I suppose there were twenty-five people on the jury that had come there, twenty-three out of the twenty-five were going to be Democrats, you see, and the county was at least sixty-forty or more Republican. Well, that was so stinkingly obvious, and the same thing was true in school matters. All the school teachers were, had to contribute to the Party and were, in effect, Democratic proteges. JH: How did the teachers feel about that, being basically coerced? JB:  Back then? JH:  Sure. JB: Well, they wanted their jobs. You cannot, of course, recall, and nobody can that didn&#x27;t pass through it, the Depression days.  That was in the thirties, and the school and 15 the teaching payroll, now that was the biggest payroll that most of the small, rural counties had. And they were all Democrats, all of them. If the Republicans started off, they had to be Democrats, or they wouldn&#x27;t stay in it. That was a part of what we were constantly driving at, but we couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. I went down to the legislature, and, of course, I was twenty-four. I remember reading, I know this so good, but I was reading here [points to a Master&#x27;s thesis on North Carolina representatives]. I had a good program and a good plan to put this back in the hands of the people and give us some democratic government just like the rest of the counties had. They sent a man down there, Judge McLean, who later became a judge, was down there. Every time I appeared before a committee, he appeared before it on behalf of the Democratic Executive Committee of that county. We had the damndest battles you ever saw. On two or three of these things, they sent whole bus loads of people down there to appear before these committees. I&#x27;ll let you look at some of it in a little while. You can see what the situation was. Anyhow, we marched up and down the hill, and nobody got anything accomplished. Nothing was done. That was &#x27;37. Then around again in &#x27;38 for the &#x27;39 thing, some of my own people said that I had created so much trouble down there. See, it was in all the papers. My God, I got more publicity than almost the rest of the legislature combined. Carl Goerch was on the radio. I don&#x27;t know whether you remember him, but he used to be the 16 editor of the State magazine. He was on the radio, and he was constantly gabbing about what I was trying to do, and they wouldn&#x27;t let me do it. The governor finally listened, Pete Murphy, who was an old-timer from the 1896 Democratic legislature, got up and made a terrible big speech and moved that they lay the most damaging legislation upon the table. They even put in legislation to just divide up the county and put it to where you couldn&#x27;t elect a Republican. Put all of, most of the voting in one district, and two on the rim. And those two were Democratic. Put all the others in there. They were going to take the county away and just run the county. They had that bill in. It came up on one of the evening sessions, and Murphy. . . . I&#x27;d created so much damn publicity and all that that he got up and made a big speech, and they laid that on the table, and then didn&#x27;t pass anything. Got by that time. Escaped by the skin of my teeth on that thing. But the next time if I went down there, they were afraid, some of my Republican friends were afraid that I&#x27;d become too much of a sore thumb. I had to run in the primary, the Republican primaries against, I remember, Dr. Hutchins, who was a dentist there. He was in the state Senate in 1937. And we had a hell of a primary but I won. JH:  What kind of issues did they stress back then? JB: Hutchins didn&#x27;t stress issues so much. He emphasized that I was young. But my father was awfully able and helped my effort a lot.  (       )  During this time a [man] would have to 17 be dumb to not learn about how the state was runthose termites in the body politics. JH:  Tell me about Jake Newell, the party chairman in 1940? JB: He was an older fellow, white hair, good stump speaker orator. Newell was the state chairman but didn&#x27;t do anything much on a county level. [There was] no executive direction. He just made speeches. I don&#x27;t remember why we in the West went against the trend. I&#x27;ve known for years that North Carolina, the western area is Republican, the eastern area is the old slave thing, strongly Democratic, 20-1. Takes state offices away. We had a respectable party in North Carolina, far different from South Carolina and Mississippi. We had enough people to be a threat. It was more difficult for us to carry the state in other southern states.  They&#x27;d go over in wholesale lots. JH: Tell me about your attempt to praise Senator Josiah Bailey for opposing FDR&#x27;s court-packing plan in the general assembly? JB: Being most indiscreet and unwise at twenty-four years old, I wrote up a vigorous resolution to condemn the president and praises Josiah Bailey&#x27;s stand. They got so mad at me they could bite a ten penny nail. Murphy agreed with me but didn&#x27;t have the courage to back it. None of them could vote for it. END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A 13 START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B: JAMES BALEY: And very favorably. JONATHAN HOUGHTON:    Tom  Bost  said  that  the  Republican efforts of building the Willkie Democratic Clubs and trying to get Democrats who support Willkie actually hurt because the Republicans wound up losing a lot of Republican support, Do vou agree wi th that? JB: Well, they could have, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that because, first of all, I was a field representative for WilIkie at the time and ran around trying to get everything for him, I don&#x27;t think that it had anything to do with it. I think the people that write these things jump to conclusions and try to explain it, but I think that the basic Republican vote came. Now, we didn&#x27;t get many of the Democrats. They just didn&#x27;t go along with it. Roosevelt, he was going into a war so that was a rough time to run against Roosevelt, and it&#x27;s quite true, as you look back at it. They talk, about the barefoot boys from Wall Street with Willkie and his utility background, but he was a powerful personality, and it was going to take a powerful one to get anything at all. That one world, you know. He had some ideas that attracted attention. I remember Willkie walked into a room. He took over that room. My God, tie had one of the finest personalities and appearances of any fellow I ever knew. I didn&#x27;t know him well, but I&#x27;d seen him. That may have accounted for the fact that T wanted to be sure that we won in &#x27;52, if we could.  But, I don&#x27;t know. 19 I can&#x27;t explain it except I think that most of the political scientists have had the wrong impression when they talk about the South. The South is different in the sense that there is a Deep South, where they were practically all Democrats, and there is an Upper South, where the Republicans o f Nor th Caro1i n a, VIrginia, and Tennessee were a little different. North Carolina was always accepted as somewhat like So u th Caro1i n a, but it was not. JH :  Not at all. JB:  No. JH: Tieless Joe To I bert is quite different from the Jonas.es and the Repub 1 i cans of Noi&quot;th Caro 1 i na . JB: That&#x27;s ri g ht. 0 h, now let me tell you, C ha r1e s Jo nas was a National Committeeman, and he was a Congressman back in &#x27;28. I remember him, and I remember them, Charles Rape r coming up. The first case 1 ever tried was in federal court, and it was against Charles Raper Jonas who was an Assistant United States Attorney then. He was about, I don&#x27;t know, six or eight years older than I was, I guess. But as I said, I wasn&#x27;t but twenty-one, and he was about twenty-eight maybe, but I remember him. JH:  So this was back when Hoover was President. JB: When Hoover was President. When it came on down to 1940, of course, I don&#x27;t know what happened, &#x27; 40 to &#x27;4 1, but I was still fighting those confounded cases in Madison County. I took nine cases to the Supreme Court, We never won in the legislature except, well, I don&#x27;t know that we won hardly any of them in the legislature, but I took nine of those cases and won seven of them,   I knocked out all those commissions as self- 20 perpetuating and unconstitutional and a wide variety of things. Books were full of it back in the thirties there, and the very time that I was called to go into the Navy, I was on a trip down to the Supreme Court in which we were arguing one of the little cases from Madison County. But those things kept me busy as far as the political field was concerned. You have no money. They don&#x27;t raise money. You get yourself in a position and everybody&#x27;s urging certain things to be done. You 1ook around and there&#x27;s nobody there. But you&#x27;re there, and you&#x27;ve got the responsibility for it, I was doing mostly that kind of stuff until I went in the Navy, and of course 1 was there for four-yea r s . I didn&#x27;t get ba c k u ntil &#x27;46 and then I was (                            ) , In &#x27;48 I was appointed Assistant State Chairman for the West by DeLapp, and Al Butler was appointed for the East. That&#x27;s the way 111 a t wo r ked. The n i n 1350, w i t h 1 a r g el y I gues s w i t h S i m &#x27; s influence, I was elected State Chairman. JH: Why did Sim resign as State Chairman? Was it his health? JB: Well, I guess he just had about as much of it as he could stand. He&#x27;d been a strong supporter of Dewey, He was for Dewey even in &#x27;40, and then &#x27;44 when he got beat, and he went for Dewey again in &#x27;48. I guess that Sim was getting older. You wear out at these things. JH;  It must have been awful frustrating, all those losses. JB:  Oh, see, you were losing most of the time, yes. JH:  Did he expect to win? 2 1 JB:  Sometimes he expected, I guess, to carry the state, but I don&#x27;t know. He won a lot in his own county, in Davidson, and there were times in the counties where people were winning and kept a little smattering of it. He was still active in the 1948 campaign. I came down to Lexington and ran the campaign as far as we were concerned. All of the materials and everything that people looked over as his materials in &#x27;48 that were in t he-Headquarter s. I was there. I took the time off from my law practice, and I was down there most of the time. JH:  That was at the Charlotte headquarters? JB: No, that was at Lexington in &#x27;48. In &#x27;50, the headquarters were at Statesville, and I was the Chairman there. Then in &#x27;52, I moved them to Charlotte and placed all the emphasis we had upon electing Jones to Congress. See, we were running t he campaigns on 2 5,000 doll ars a year.  W e h a d n o mo ney. JH: Why was it that the Republican Party had so little money? JB:  You never win. JH: What type of people voted Republican? Was it more middle class people or was it basically the same sort of people as the Democrats? JB: People were voting Republican for the same reasons they were voting Democrat, because their mothers and fathers had been and that they sort of inherited their politics. There were just more of them all the time. Go back to the Civil War and you&#x27;ll find that the western area was not for secession, even Zeb Vance, t he  Democrat.    We  had  a  bas1c  backg ro u n d,  this  and  east 22 Tennessee, of being for the Union. The east was, of course, the slave holding element, and they just inherited a lot of things. Now , I k n o w you have issues, a n d it&#x27;s h a r d to t h i n k , but look back. You&#x27;ll see most of the people that had an orientation in their* political [views], they remain that way. Roosevelt took a great bunch of the Republicans over because there were jobs available. They were giving jobs all over the country during the thirties, JH:  So the patronage jobs and. . , . J B : T h e pat r o n a g e j o b s and all these w el fa r e pro g r a m s a n d all of these national youth, , , . You remember Lyndon Johnson was a head of a national youth organization in Texas. All of those things, and we lost a great bunch of them. I know people sort of drifted back. Lamar Cudger&#x27;s father, we ran for Congress, Lamar is a judge now and has been in the Congress on the Democratic ticket and served many terms down in t he-legislature as a Democrat . His father was a strong Republican and ran for Congress here. I knew him, I understand Herbert H y de&#x27;s b a c k g r ound is Republ i c a n ., He r b e r t &#x27; s C h a i r ma n of the Democratic Party here, I ran across a letter that reminded me, here. JH: And these people were all administering New Deal programs? JB: I don&#x27;t know that they were doing that, but there were a lot of other things that they could do. Any lawyer can have no hope of being a judge because they nominate in the districts and elect in the whole state.  The worst and most UNDEMOCRATIC 23 thing that I know of in the United States is nominating these Superior C ourt judg e s and giving the appearance of elections. See, nominating them in a little judicial district, and then voting on them in the general election state wide where there&#x27;s never a chance for a Republican. JH : So the Repub1ican counties ha ve no chanee in a Democratic state? J B:  It depends how Rep ub1ic an they a re.  Not state w ide . JH:  Twenty to one from Raleigh to the coast is Democratic. J B : P arty-wise, t h e y have been the strongest centralized state in the things that touch the people. The educational system, until fairly recently, all the Boards of Education were Democratic. Appointed from the legislature, and they run the education process. The education, the roads, all the people that worked for the Highway Commission, that was almost a patronage situation. The leaders of the roads, the highways, the courts, the judicial systems, t he solfcitors, the judges, all that , t he y were all Democratic until 1963 when they needed our twenty-one votes in the legislature to get the Court Reform Program by. They had to agree to make the district judges elected, and at that time, they did agree to do so. They wouldn&#x27;t put the others, but they reached a compromise, and it was passed that way, and we still elect a few district judges. But that came not because they wanted it, but because they weren&#x27;t going to get that Court Reform Bill unless they did, you see. JH:  And what year was that, &#x27;63? 24 JB: That was in &#x27;63. It is hard for me to get into my mind all of the v a r i&#x27;ous t h i n g s that h a v e b e e n used o v e r t he ye a r s pol itical 1 y , You see, they had enough of a threat i n North Carolina that it was not like, as I have told you, the rest of the South. JH: But going back to the New Deal years, a lot of Republicans deserted their Party? JB: Well, when you say deserted, a great many peop1e had no re a 1 strong con ta ct w i t h the Repub1ican Party. Madison County would have too if they hadn&#x27;t of had so many of these fights going on and so much of this stuff going on down there. They would have been that way too. Now, you see people wondering why in real votes, the Party line is not strong. The political Par11e s do not have the st rength that they used to have, The r e was something to be said for permitting patronage to be in the hands of the various parties. If there is nothing that the parties have to offer but just mother and God and that we&#x27;re going to do things better, it&#x27;s very difficult to get people to he1p an d to c on t rib u te. Of cours e, n o wa days, J im Martin runs for the Party, that&#x27;s true. But when he was running this first time, he r an a 1ong with t he Par ty. It h i nk Helms wa s r u nning w ith him too, wasn&#x27;t he?  I&#x27;m not sure, JH: In &#x27;34? Yes. Both of them together and Reagan too. In &#x27;72, the other part of the equation, I guess, is that Nixon was running and had coat tail effects on Helms and Holshouser. JB: That&#x27;s right. Then the reason we dropped, Watergate. Why, we had no chance.  I was on the court back in &#x27;73.  I don&#x27;t 25 know whether you know this or not. You were younger, but I served on the Court of Appeals. I was, I suppose, the first Republican on the Court of Appeals, the first one on it. I went down there in, let&#x27;s see, it was about May of &#x27; 7 3 and served there, and then served for the balance of that term which was about a year and a half maybe. I think I went out next time. When I saw there was no hope tor me, that I&#x27;d be running for reelection when Watergate came in, I knew, for God&#x27;s sake, we had no chance to win on the state basis when we didn&#x27;t have any in the nation, And certainly we weren&#x27;t going to win it this time. I ran, not for the Court of Appeals, but for the North Carolina Supreme Court. Well, of course, I got beat. Donny Smith got beat that time too. He was running for the Superior Court. Then Holshouser appointed me as one of the special judges, and I served for about five years on the Superior Court before I retired. See, I was getting up sixty odd years old then. I think I was sixty-two when I made the Court of Appeals. Now, you simply can&#x27;t see how the thing is unless you were working within it. We reached the stage, and we&#x27;ve got the stage now when it is still extremely difficult for us to do anything because they still had it, that historic background of being a Democrat and all of them around them Democrat, Henderson County basically had some of that as the ir Repub1 leans. Ave ry, Mitchell, and Madison and some of the others around had some of that too. Catawba, Ashe, some of them had that too. But if you look at it, you&#x27;ll find that that pattern is stronger and the Party allegiance, sometimes it&#x27;s stronger than a man&#x27;s re1igion. 26 When they were talking about Al Smith running, now, some of then deserted. We carried the state for Hoover, but a great many didn&#x27;t. They didn&#x27; t do it with Ke nnedy , a n d they h av e n&#x27;t done it at any time. It&#x27;s reached now, we ere a little more sophisticated in our approach to matters now in politics, and you can reason with people that the fact that a man is black does not disqualify him for office. Take your black situation, that people are afraid to mention the black situation. But there is no question in my mind but that we&#x27;ve got the South now because the Democrats embraced the blacks, and the blacks took over thirty-five percent of their Party. They can&#x27;t win anything anywhere without the black vote, They started to run in the national picture. Any of these states that are anywhere near close, they&#x27;ve got to have all the black vote. They would do that in the South too. They get all the black vote, but that has made some of the white Democrats, to the poi nt that they are voting Repub1ican. Hell, these are not new Republicans, I mean new people that have just come in. Some of them have come in from the North, Now, he says [points to book] that a lot of it&#x27;s migration, and some of it is, but what has been, run this through just North Carolina, but not with the South. The basic thing, what they&#x27;re doing, how do you suppose Jesse Helms ran and beat Governor Hunt, who had the thing in his pocket? At least they thought he did. Jesse Helms voted against the holiday. JH :  The Martin Luther King ho1iday. 27 JB: He did other things. He comes out and says, &quot;( ) is quitting.&quot; He knows everybody in the state knows what his position is and that he doesn&#x27;t have to appeal for any votes. He doesn&#x27;t. But every white in the east, nearly, is going to vote for him, and there&#x27;s more of them. J H : N ow that brings me to an interest i n g quest io n . I n 1948, the year that Strom Thurmond broke from the Democratic F&#x27; a r t y a n d set u p a S tates&#x27; Ri g h t P a r t y , D e w e y w a s r u n n i n g a g a i n , who was popular Governor and a strong personality. Harry Truman seemed like the worst nightmare possible for Southern Democrats, yet Truman won the state, The Republicans made new appeals to the east. T h e y h a d a c a m p a i g n h e a d q u a r t e r s i n Rale i g h f o r the first time. JB: Oh no, I had one down there earlier, &#x27;52. I established one clown there during the term of the legislature. We had a separate headquarters, had Wade Marr in it. I don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;ve come across him oi not, but we had one there and kept it during the legislature. We had them introduce bills on apportionment of the Congressional districts because Wade wrote one of them, I remember. JH:  That was &#x27;52? JB: Yes, it must have been in &#x27;52, or- &#x27;54 was when the 1egis1 ature, I know I wasn&#x27;t there in &#x27;54. I was in the United States Attorney&#x27;s office. I guess it was, maybe it was &#x27;50 because I was elected in &#x27;50, I may have been down there during the legislature of &#x27;51 because we were trying to get an apportionment  and  wrote  an  excellent  bill  that  made  the 28 population somewhat equal. Had it introduced and everything, but we couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere. But here&#x27;s a strange thing. We would have thought that with the platforms we&#x27;ve had and our appeal to the common man, we didn&#x27;t have the aristocracy. The aristocracy of the rich, the establishment, was Democratic in this state. We had the ragtag and bobtail so to speak, the c o mmon, run-of-1 he-mill men. You wou1d have thought that th e labor people and the black would be more in line with what we were thinking and what we wanted and would be fighting the establishment, not so. That wasn&#x27;t the way it worked. We appealed to that during &#x27;43 and around in that time, and we appealed to them, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happened. It&#x27;s reversed itself, and they&#x27;ve got all of the blacks. JH: Well, ho w d i d the Republicans appeal to 1 abo r and b1 ack voters in 1948? JB: Well, we appealed to them by wanting lower tax exemptions and things that just appeal to the run-of-the-mill i ndi vi dua 1 s on the street. They were all of t hat kind. The estab1ishment, the arist oc racy o f the 5 o uth, was De moc ra tic. Those that had come down as the sons of the aristocracy and so f o r t h w e i&quot; e Democrats. T h e y w ere all cente r e d i n t h e U n i v ersit y of North Carolina and the people that come there. I know that the University of North Carolina is the biggest hot bed of the Democratic Party there ever was, John Wi1k inson and I were about t h e o n 1 y t w o b a c k i n o 11 r era, and eve n I a t e i- i t w a s s t r o n g Democratic. Host of the young people, and even then, it fed a lot of the people that filled these solicitors and judges and 2 9 t he i r ilk, We&#x27;ve had a ter r I b 1 e hai d st r ugg 1 e ove r t h is, nea r1 y a century that I&#x27;ve been in It, half a century. It&#x27;s been a, but you will find this. You will find in our platform things that when we back off and don&#x27;t push, that they have adopted and taken i n . We were talking about vetoes. I was talking about it when I spoke to the League of Women Voters over in Tyron, one of these times. I don&#x27;^ know how long ago it was. Here, I believe it was &#x27;64, A 1 ong t ime, way bac k i n the ear 1 i er day s , and I had introduce d a bi11 In the 1 e g i si ature to try to ge t the district judges, I mean the judges of the Superior Court, elected in their district rather than over the state at large. But a lot of these 111 ings, for example, we wanted a revision of the State Constitution. We had a number of things we wanted in It too. We wanted the veto power put in that. They never did do that, but they did have a Constitutional Study Commission and did make a lot of revisions. I was on it. They put me on I guess as a, you know, like they put a women on to be the. . . . J H:  The tok e n RepubIican. JB : The tcken Repub 1 i can , i was onit, I bel i e ve .Jonas was on it if I&#x27;m not mistaken. Char1 ie Jonas and I were on that Constitutional Study Commission. The rest of them, ten, fifteen, twenty more, were others, and we did that in about, I don&#x27;t remember when that was, but it&#x27;s been some little time. There are other things which we have suggested, of course. We&#x27;d been talking about electing the members of the Board of Education, They&#x27;ve come around, and some of those ar^ being elected now. 3 0 Other little things that we&#x27;ve done. We didn&#x27;t do this, blacks made them reapportion things, but we&#x27;ve had it when the black minority representative comes up to me and talks about being in the m1nori ty and being oppressed, I said, &quot;You don&#x27;t know what a minority is. You haven&#x27;t been oppressed at all. They take care ot you. If you want to know what&#x27;s being oppress-d, you hav* to go down to the east and look at some of those eastern Republicans, and you&#x27;ll know what being oppressed is.&quot; And John W ilk!nson used to ta 1k about that. JH*  How are the eastern Repub1icans oppressed? J B: Well, the y j ust never, J ohn knows from practicing 1 aw, Don&#x27;t you suppose the fact that all the judges are Democratic has something tc do with a man&#x27;s practice? JH:  So he would be more apt to lose his cases? JB: Well, he&#x27;d be more apt not to get them, The truth of the matter is it doesn&#x27;t always work that way. If you&#x27;re good enough, they&#x27;ll come. I represented a great many. Most of my clients were Democrats, but you have to acquire a reputation of some kind beforehand. T was probably better off never being a j u d g e , corni n g a 1 o n g w h e n I w a s real 1 y . . . . This ju cl geship of mi ne was sort of an after thought. I was over sIxty years o 1 d when 1 went into that, but I was a United States Attorney and other things, you see. I got that by being a Republican and getting it from Eisenhower, So you get the point. Browne 1 1 &#x27; s the one that took care of me. But Wilkinson and some of the, we&#x27;ve got a few that are good lawyers, Al Butler stood out but h e stood out o n a b Hit y .   H e a n d J o h n W i Ikinson stood out o n 3 1 ability too. But when you realize that every one of the judges that you&#x27;re going to face. . . . I practiced law until I was forty  something  years  old  before  I  ever  appeared  before  a Republican judge, and that was when I was going to the Court of Appea 1 s anc! appeal i ng before J udge John J . Parker . By the way , I was bailiff for him one time, and he. came to our house when he was running for Governor back in 1920. I was a boy. He came to our house, in Marshall, and he gave his speech down there. So you have some of it. JH:  We&#x27;re way back In the Party,  John Parker, JB: John J. Parker. That&#x27;s right. 1 remember John J, Parker. He came to our house. Dad was the Chairman of the Party in Madison County, and he came arid had dinner with us when he came there to speak. But that was a long time ago. I don&#x27;t look back at that.  I&#x27;m having pretty good health, strong. JH:  You 1ook rea 1 strong, that&#x27;s for sure. JB:  We 11, I p1 ay tennis (                              ). JH :  Monday , Wednesdav , Fr i day tennis? JB: That&#x27;s right. Played yesterday and played pretty hard, but you can&#x27;t go on forever. I realize that. Well now, what are these questions that you said you had? JH : You&#x27;ve been hitti ng a 1 ot of the i rnpor tant ones just i n telling me your stories and reflections. One question I would like to ask relates to John Wilkinson, as long as we&#x27;re talking about him, and his campaign for Senate if 1948. He ran for Senate the same year that Strom Thurmond was going for President. He tried to appeal to the east, the eastern voters there.   An 3 2 eastern candidate going for- Senate was a little unusual  for Republicans, but he had no luck at all. He campaigned very hard again s t 1ruman, w hereas his opponent, Broughton , hard1y s a id anything, (                                                                  ) . JB : Was Eroughton the one running agai nst him? We 11, Broughton&#x27;s a former governor and a bi g Baptist 1 ayman , you know, Baptists and Democrats. That&#x27;s what made them so mac! here lately when Ronald Reagan took the Southern Baptist vote, and they were voting for h i m n o w . But w e s ay it, I&#x27;m a B a p tis t. You used to say that the Baptists and the Democrats. . . . The reason he, on reason was the strength of his opposition within the Democratic Party. I don&#x27;t have a very strong recollection of that because J got out of the Navy and started practicing law about the first of the year of &#x27;47. I guess I was active, but I don&#x27;t recall doing much except within my area, I had to make a living too. I had to start my practice again. I just don&#x27;t really recall about John, I know, of course, that I was always strong for him, I don&#x27;t think I approve of a lot of hi s very extreme stands and the vigor that he poses and all that. Some of that, I&#x27;m much more temperate, but he has been a great force for the Republican Party, there&#x27;s no doubt about that. He&#x27;s been the most outspoken and articulate in the cause of the Republicans than anybody that I knew of in the state, and especially in the east. JH:  He&#x27;s had a real uphi 11 battle there. J B : 0 h, it&#x27;s been a battle all the time. Fortunate1y, J ohn, I think, c a me through fair1y we 11,  I don&#x27;t know, fair1y 33 well through family, or at least modestly so. Now I know he inherited Philip Morris from one ot his, . . , I know he&#x27;s now sitting on easy street, and he can do as he wants to. But he&#x27;s probably nearly eighty years old. J H :  A n d he&#x27;s still st r o n g a n c! active ? JB: Oh yes. He was the National Committeeman down at this last convention. JH:  Was he rea 1 1y? J B : 0 h , I w as at the state con v e n t i o n , a n d J o h n w a s , a n d h e was Nationa 1 Committeeman. He&#x27;d been appointed by the committee ot something, and he was expecting to be nominated and elected by the state con v e n tion this time. I don&#x27;t k now the details. I don&#x27;t know how, but they wanted this fellow who&#x27;s the head of Hardee&#x27;s hamburgers, Hardee&#x27;s, and that group. I think they wanted him as a fund raiser, and they were going to make him National Committeeman, They nominated John, and John fought. said the hell with that. He came to me, and I seconded his nomination or, in effect, nominated him practically. The other boy didn&#x27;t know him, and we had quite a little fight down there, and damned if he didn&#x27;t nearly win. It was all of the organized group against him. I was for Bush when I was Chairman, Co-Chair man for the Bush people, here in the county. Well, the Bush people came to me then and wanted my support. I said, &quot;Oh no. I can&#x27;t do that. In fact, I&#x27;m going to be for him as strong as I can.&quot; John made more speeches. He was personally wel1-known. He ran a ver y st rong r ace , even w 1 th t he Busli el ement agai nst hi in and the Governor&#x27;s peop1e and Gardner &#x27; s group and a 11 that, but 34 John, well, he shouldn&#x27;t have been in it, truthfully, but he wanted to do it. He&#x27;s still stomping around and all that, Have you talked to him? JH: No, I&#x27;ve read several of his speeches, and I&#x27;m very interested in his 1948 campaign. The Republicans. It seems to me, started a new strategy. They just swamped the airwave:-,. T hey bought rad10 time twice a weel on fifty-three radio stations for John Wilkinson, and he didn&#x27;t run well, and I don&#x27;t under stancl why he d i dn &#x27; t r un well. JB: I don&#x27;t think he was a good candidate in a full el eeti o n . J o h n i s v e r y f i e r y a n d h e a d s t r o n g a n d i m p u 1 s ive. .J o h n put up a lot of money in that campaign too. One of the reasons he had so many ads. I suspect, was that he paid for them. We didn&#x27;t have very much money, Well, of course, the governor in now, in fact, this last governor&#x27;s race, I expect, spent more money than any with the possible exception of Helms and Hunt. But they got it now with these PAC&#x27;s, where you just have to have a n e norrnou s amount of money. JH: Do you think there&#x27;s a lot of tension between the Congressional Club and the Republican Party as far as, say, fund raising goes or even Party responsibilities? JB: Yes, there are some elements. The Congressional Club was a n esse nti a 1 thing for our winning, but it faiIs to recognize that the Repub1ican Party structure is also essential for It, 1 told you that Holshouser and Helms won because they complemented each other, to a degree, on the people to whom they appealed, and that  was  simi1 ar1y  true  in  Martin  and  Helms.    What  the 35 Congressional Club, the Congressional Club is very, very valuable if it would be an adjunct, in a sense, of the Republican Party, But it&#x27;s t r y i n g t o r u n t h i n g s , and w hen it gets I n t o tha t , i t antagonizes and hurts. I think it cost us tremendously important s^ats in the Senate when they didn&#x27;t support Broyhill. I don&#x27;t know, rhev may have supported him, nominally, I&#x27;m not saying they didn&#x27;t, but putting out this fellow against Broyhill In the P r imarv.... J Hi:  Fu n d e r b u r k ? JB : Funderbur k was totally unnecessar y , and caused a lot of bitterness and strife. But you&#x27;re going to have that as the Party grows. And when people talk about, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do this, that, and the other with the Congressional Club,&quot; they&#x27;ve g o t to be a r i n m 1 n d t h a t t h a t C o n g r e s s i onal C1 u b w as \&lt;  r y , ver y important to making the break through that put us into where we carrled the state and where we are now to some degree. I thi nk they are perhaps a bit immoderate in the way they do it, but: sometimes, Houghton, it&#x27;s essential that you draw a sufficient line between the candidates and the parties where you can attract people to you r side. W e w 1 11 nev e r w in eIec tions in this state if we just run w i t h everybody being a moderate, nice, pleasant fellow, very able fellows, two able fellows running, Republican and Democrat. We&#x27;re going to get beat nearly two to one. You&#x27;re j u s t g o i n g t o c ount th e reg i s t r ation , a n d give the m a n w h o h a s some dissatisfaction, give him no hope that you&#x27;re any better, or t h at t h e r e 1 s n &#x27; t a cliff e r e n c e . Y o u &#x27; v e got t o ma k e a diff e r e nee , and if you don &#x27; t dci 11,  George Bush wouIdn&#x27;t have been beaten 36 this time if he hadn&#x27;t have gotten strongly before the public, especial I y i n t h e S o u t h , 1 n N o r t h C a r o 1 i n a , th a t Mi cliae 1 D u k a k i s was a northeastern liberal of the Kennedy stripe and just as far on the left as you can get. The fact that he was running against J ackson, who was w a y o ut, and making hi m s e1f look modest1y moderate in the primaries, was an entirely different proposition. George had to draw it. He had to show the difference between him and [Dukakis] for the sake of the people who would have been interested in changing over. Now, that may not be the smartest fellow. That may be a fellow who looks upon the flag and the pledge of allegiance as a real issue, whether you&#x27;re going to be f or cloi ng t ha t, and t hi s Wi 1 1 i e Hough ton rape t hi ng . JH:  Horton, Morton.  I&#x27;m Houghton. JB: Houghton, Willie Morton. Yes, I&#x27;ve got you. Well, those were symbols to indicate the feelings and the strife and the beliefs of the other fellow. If you try to argue like a perfect gentleman in North Carolina, Democrat and Republican, why, hell, you&#x27;re going to get beat every time, JH; So, would you go so far as to say that a Republican couldn&#x27;t win on a rational debate of the Issues, but they have to use symbolic politics to win? JB : I say he can win the debate on the rational politics and so forth. But if the other fellow is somewhat close to what he debates, and, you know, debates are not just totally one way, they are an interim in them. You&#x27;ve got to make the line of demarcation so clear that the man&#x27;s got some reason. There are strong partisans in this state.  A man&#x27;s got to have some reason 37 to change over and vote the other way. That&#x27;s the reason you have Sanford. Hell, that&#x27;s the reason Sanford beat Broyhill. Broyhill was much better qualified to be in the Senate and had a senator 1 a 1 b a c k g r o u n cl a n d k n e w t h e t h i n g s u p t h e r e . B u t w e tip toe along, and the Democrat, why, he votes Democratic. JH:   But Martin won.   He seemed to play a more moderate s t a n c e .  He b eat J o r dan quite h a n cl ily. JB: I don&#x27;t mean for the candidate himself to make all of t he points t hat mi ght clraw a line. Mart in, there wasn &#x27; t a great deal of difference between them except something like this--Jordan wants all the rednecks to, you&#x27;re going to keep quiet and not let the rednecks know how close I am to the blacks. Now, Jim Martin, what does he have to do? He gets up before the State Convention down there, welcomes everybody there regardless of the color of your neck. My God , it just brought the house down, see. He just brought the house down. And for Jordan to be, he was a weak candidate, for h 1 rn to 1: e stupid enough to go and get it filmed. I mean, they filmed him making that statement to the blacks. END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B 38 START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A: JONATHAN HOUGHTON:   So could you tell me what are some ot the differences between your emphasis and J.E. Broyhill&#x27;s emphasi s? JAMES BALEY; Well, Mr, Broyhill placed more emphasis upon the national picture. He was interested in elections to Congrass. He wa s i nterested in gett in g a 1o n g w i th the people in Congress, and how the national picture developed. As far as the North Carolina Republican Party was concerned, I was interested in things that related to state affairs and to our local affairs. I felt the local politics and the state politics more than Mr. Broyhill. He was a very wealthy furniture manufacturer and, of course, was interested in the national picture, and the tax picture, and in the other interests. JH: So that led him to support Democratic, Bob Doughton, for re-election and trying to keep the Republicans. , , . JB: I doubt if Nr. Broyhill actually supported Congressman D o u g h ton. B u t I cl o k n o w t h is, t b a t he&#x27; s a g o o d f r i end, a n cl t h a t he felt that he thought precisely like Doughton did. He was a v e r y co n s e r v a t i v e i nd i v i d u a 1 , a n d h e wa s a v e r y i n f 1 u e n tial ma n ancl I , as f ar as Mr . Br oyhill &#x27; s busi ness 1 nterest s and thi ngs of that kind are conc e r ned, I&#x27;m s u r e he felt that Congressman Doughton was cer ta I n 1 y a saf er i ncli v i dua 1 . But as f ar as actual 1 y getting out and supporti ng hi m , I don &#x27; t thi nk i t wou 1 cl have been anything of that kind. He&#x27;s too intelligent to be dis1ova 1 in that fashion,  Now, he mIght have trled in a private 39 way to keep him from having opposition, something like that. But I really don&#x27;t, . . . j H : The boo k w ritte n b y h i s s &lt; &gt; n -in-1 a w , Bill Stevens, it basically said that Broyhill didn&#x27;t want a Republican to run against Doughton because he saw Doughton, as Chairman of the Ways a n cl M e a n s C o m m 11 tee, g i v i n g v e r y a 11 r a c five legislat i o n . H e thought it would be better not to oppose him. There was some dissatisfaction in the Union Republican^ the old Republican newspaper, and Monroe Adams sent in a telegram saying that it was a shame, and the Republicans had to contest every seat and the elect i on because t hey hadn&#x27;t opposed Doughton . He &#x27; cl gone clown a n cl c a m p a 1 g n e cl f o r h I s son- I n - I a w w h o w a s r u n n i n g f o r a Democratic sheriff&#x27;s spot in a nearby county on a local ticket. So they had a primary between the two Republleans, Then D o u g h t o n &#x27; s c a n d i date w o n the p r i m a r v , a n cl the n t h e y s a I cl t h e y cl i d r &#x27; t r u n a v ery st r o ng e lectio n . JB: Well, I can understand something like that. You don&#x27;t get into politics unless you occasionally have some ot those little differences of opinion. I could understand what It was. I k n e w M on roe A d a m s , a nci I &#x27; m sure M o nroe wanted them t o r u n a straight down-the-line Party opposition. And occasionally, I suspect, Mr. Broyhill just felt, &quot;Well, Doughton is going to win anyhow, and there isn&#x27;t any use in our simply antagonizing him, and I feel he&#x27;ll be all right,&quot; That was the way, his interest was more in the national picture more than In the state picture because he had never won in the state picture, you see.  I was 4 0 i n terested in developing a ftd w inning on both the nationa 1 and the local scale wherever we could. JH; Did people think you were crazy to try and get strong Republican precinct organizations? You emphasized the regi s t r at i on lists an cl g etti n g i n the r e and mot i v a 11 n g t h e P a r t y chairman.  Was there just. . , . J B : W e w e r e just f ighti n g a tou g h battle all t h e 11 in e . When you say people thought we were crazy, I suppose a lot of the Democrats, when I was i n the legislature, I had a great many of the Democrats suggest that I would be of more service to the state and be accepted more if I transferred to being a Democrat and my registration would be a Democrat, Of course, I just laughed at them. I was right in the middle of struggles in Madison County, and I wasn&#x27;t even close to it. Well, I had no information that was worth the change, and the truth of the rn atte r i s that I w a n t e d n o t h iin g most ti m e , I n e v e r w ante d anything particularly in a job. I wanted it available for my Party, for people who could qualify for it, and I&#x27;ve never, In asking people to run, I never tried to tell them what they wanted to clo particularly. I expeotecl them to handie it at the stage they got in. I never tried to dictate what it was. I was just i nte r e sted i n wi n n i ng . 0f course, we d i d n &#x27; t do too muc h else.

Gavin considered to be about the most liberal main-line element of the Republican Party or is that not a fair characterization of him? 4 1 JB: I don&#x27;t think that he was liberal. None of our people-were as. . . . J H:  Didn&#x27;t he want to reach out and. . . . JB: He used to be a United States District Attorney in the eastern part, In the middle districts, but he was probably more liberal than some of our people. Gavin was not one or my, I knew his son more, Bob. JH:  Who ran against Terry Sanford? JB:  Yes. JH:  And in that campaign. . . . JB:  (                                                             ). JH: Can you tell me a little bit about the absentee ballot frauds and their impact on the Republican Party, and what sort of frauds were being carried out by Democrats? JB: Well, the absentee ballot frauds covered the whole range of election irregularities. They voted people who were not present in the county. They voted people who were off working and remained there. They voted people who didn&#x27;t even know they were being voted. They had a notary seal that was false, and w-? couldn&#x27;t find the notaries, and there were innumerable irregularities of all kinds. I&#x27;ve heard that vote buying was a relatively simple process. They would simply be, the Chairman of the Board of Elections would permit some Democratic ward heeler to have both the application and the ballot. He would just take the application and the ballot and go out to the individual, and they would go through the process of voting it. He had a seal, and he put the notary&#x27;s seal on it and paid them off.  They had 42 e nor m ous, big percent a g e s of the popu1 a t i o n pur porting to v c&lt;te b y absentee [ballot], and maybe they did vote, in a sense, by absentee. But there was no cause for their doing it, and nobody else had any opportunity to see them. It was just a question of committeemen to have the material, go out and, in effect, have them cio it, and pay them off, and know they were getting the votes they were being paid for. It was a clear indication of irregularities, but we had a lot of difficulties because sometimes you couldn&#x27;t prove that it concerned a federal ballot, and that had to be gone into. And there were a lot of technicalities that made it difficult to get it within the federal j u r I s d i ctio n t h ere. W e cl I cl n &#x27; t h a v e a G r a n d J u r y b a c k then like we do now that has the right to call people before them and make an investigation of the case, and if they do not testify or refuse to testify or testify wrongfully, that you take them up f o r p e r j u r y .  T h a t w a s neve r done.  N o w t h ey &#x27; re cl o I n g t h i n g s . JH: Has there been a lot of absentee ballot abuse in Democratic primaries? Is that why they eliminated it from Democratic primaries, and kept it only in general elections to use against Republicans? JB: Yes, some of it. I don&#x27;t remember specific cases because I was not engaged in the Democratic primaries, but I do know that they had enormous problems within the Democratic Primary.  I believe it was when Mr . McDona 1d ran the Party. JH:  Ralph McDonald. JB: Ralph McDonald ran for governor, and it was so bad that the Democratic legislature passed a law eliminating the 43 absentee ba 1 1 ot f rom t he pr I mar i es but retai ni ng 11 f or use i n the general election. Of course, the Republican Party had a f 1 e 1 cl cl a y w i th t h at, T h ey t ho u g h t a n y t h i n g t h a t w a s t o o r otte n for the Democratic primary was certainly too rotten to be used against the Republicans. But they went ahead with it. The absentee ballot has grown to where it is not used in such a depraved way as it used to be. It&#x27;s better than that, but it is still subject to a lot of abuse at times. They&#x27;re getting better about the election problems, and they&#x27;re getting a little better about some of the other things. The ma jot thing that they&#x27;ve not touched Is, that I consider, this reform of the courts to where they are nominating their Superior Court judges in a district and then having the two nominees run in the general election in the state at large. That, ot course, enables the Democratic Party to win all the elections or did so up until this 1988 election when w e did w i n , a n cl J i m M a r tin c a r r i e cl t h e state . W e w on, I believe, one Superior Court judge, and we won one judge on the Court of Appeals. JH: Did it hurt the morale of the typical Republican Party member to know that you&#x27;re losing elections through absentee ballot frauds, or do you think that it might have even had a beneficial effect because it gave the Republicans such a strong a r g u me nt , s u c h r I ghteousness on the i r s i cl e , to kind of rail y the forces? JB: Well, of course, when you beat your head against the wall too many times, eventually, It gets tired. It will make you mad for a while, but constant taking things away from you gets to 4 4 where you&#x27;re discouraged about the whole process, yes. Some people it wouldn&#x27;t. Some of them are right steadfast in their purpose. I was one of those, and I kept at it all the time, but we did have people who were very much discouraged, the way they were treated. We have that same situation now. People do not like to run for office, for example, if they have absolutely no hope of winning or feel like that&#x27;s going to be taken away from t h e m e v e n i f t h e y cl o w i n . JH: How did you select candidates in the thirties and forties, say for Congressional offices or even gubernatorial offices because there wasn&#x27;t much shot that they would win, and most of them, presumably, knew that they would lose? So who would you get to r un , ancl why wou 1 d they r un? JB: Well, we usually select the state officers in a state convention. The people who ran, ran out of, I suppose, loyalty to their Party. We tried to help finance them as best we could. Occasionally, we&#x27;d find some people who were interested in a little stronger race than we could give them. They&#x27;d put up money and go after it as if they could win, and sometimes, occasionally, people, particularly in Congress, you did have a chance to win sornething, and you helped people i n the counties that would win occasionally because you were running. Why do people become members of a Party at all? They try to stand up, I suppose, for some good government, and you could sell people on the basis that, hopefully, we were going to strike a blow for a v a &quot;1 i cl t wo - p a r t y s y ste rn in this state. It&#x27;s t a k e n fitt y y e a r s but we are    about to reach where we have a two-party system.   If we 4 5 h adn&#x27;t done anyth1n g a 1 1 the w a y through there wou1dn&#x27;t be any hope whatsoever. J H : In a pamphlet pub 1 i she cl b y J o h n W i Ikinso n in 1948, t h e Repub 1 i can Party warneel, &quot;Don&#x27;t let anyone f righten you wi th threats of economic and social pressures,&quot; and then it encouraged people to vote Republican and told them they could vote Republican. What sort of economic and social pressures were used to maintain Democratic allegiance, especially in the eastern section of the state where the Democratic majority is so strong? JB: Of course, I was not involved as directly in the eastern counties because I lived in the west, but the same kind of, when you speak of economic pressures, you talk about the school system in most of our western counties. You had to be a Democrat to get a job in the schools. JH: If, say, you were a Republican who owned a car wash, would Democrats not go to you or was it that severe? JB: It wasn&#x27;t so much that. If you could show it was to their financial and economic interests to go, they would go, but take, for example, the tax matters. The tax appraisals could be higher. My lot and house in Madison County when I lived up here was appraised as high as any in Madison County, and it was far from being the best one there. There are all sorts of little interests and little things that can be done if they want to do them. All in the world you&#x27;ve got to do is cut the tax appraisal and that saves the fe11ow money in paying taxes , and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it because I know, who wants to come out a n d t r y t o e s tab! i s h b ef o r e a b u n c h o f boar d s an cl e vent u a 1 1 y t h e 4 6 courts that so and so was treated better than he should have been? Who wants to attack that? There are all sorts of pressures you can put on them. They can save, and John spoke of social pressures. Well, people would come down from the North 01 some other place and go into an area, and they&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, if you expect to take part in this election of your officials, you better join the Democratic Partv because you can be in the Democratic primary then.&quot; That is not the way it&#x27;s working now. They&#x27;re comi ng clown and joi n 1 ng the Republican Par ty , and the y &#x27; re wor k i ng in the Rep u b 1 lean p r i ma r ies, a n d they&#x27; i&quot; e electin g people. Well, you say, &quot;Why do you do that?&quot; We do it because we eventual 1y won. JH:  So, you had a vision that sustained the Party growth? JB:  We hoped to, yes. JH: Is that what a lot of people in the thirties and forties, during those lean years, they looked to the future and t h o u g h t t h at t h ere c o u 1 cl b e a r e a 1 I g n m e n t o n p r e s i cl e n tial P oli tics a in d h a v e t h a t t r i c k 1 e d ow n ? JB: There couldn&#x27;t have been a lower ebb in our Party&#x27;s fortune than there was during the Franklin Roosevelt years and the Depression. I was in it. I went through it, but I considered it a duty as a citizen to work for a better government, and that a better government was only going to come through a two-party system where there was some hope that people would have competition, They wouldn&#x27;t just do it like, a dictatorship of a majority is about as bad as you can get. That&#x27;s as bad, nearly, as having a single dictatorship.  What we 47 had all the way through is a dictatorship of a majority, and we would rise up and fight it, and we wanted to get the point that we could shake that off. We would get, when we elected Jonas, they were never able to beat Jonas. They reapportioned his district. They worked it all around that that would never li appen . Well, th a t g i ves you enco u r a geme n t . Wh e n y o u d o n &#x27; t w i n a s o ften, you get a b i g ger k i c k out o f w i n n ing, a n d t h e n eventually, in their efforts to weed Jonas out, they mixed up their districts, and we elected Broyhill. It got so at one time, we got five out of the six, and who knows? We&#x27;ve got the Governor now, and one of the Senators. Who knows but that we might keep going a little more, This time, in the legislature.. we have forty-six representatives that were elected. JH:  Out of 120? JB: Out of 120. Now. we don&#x27;t control the legislature, and w e &#x27; ve go t thirteen outoft h e fifty S e n a tors. We don&#x27;t c o ntrol that, but there are times there when there is a difference of opinion among members of the Democratic Party, where they need the Republican vote, and you can get things and trade around and try to accomplish what you feel is for the good of your Party and for the good of your state. JH: When do you think a two-party system became a reality in North Carolina? Would you argue that it was there in the thirties or forties or is there any turning point that you would say would make it officially two parties? JB: It depends upon how effective you have to be in order for you to call it a two-party system.  We had a two-party system 4 3 in several of the counties, and we had a two-party system in several of the Congressional districts as they went through. We were just never able to put it together for the whole state. N o w , we&#x27;re getting to the point where, with the metropolit a n counties, the urban sections of the Piedmont, we&#x27;re getting to where if they vote Republican, we can win, The fact that we have the potential for doing that makes them a little more careful, and they do a better job in trying to keep things right and running the government than they would if they just had no restraint whatsoever. Even as we attacked the windmill, so to speak, and never won, we had projects and issues and purposes and t h i n g s w h 1 c h t h e y a cl op ted eve n t u a 1 1 y and p assed t h r o u g h . It h i n k we&#x27;re eventually going to give the veto to the governor, It may not be the next term. It may not be the one after, but eventually we &#x27; re going to do it. Last time they put in a r e s o 1 ut i o n , 1 t h i nk it w a s i n t h e S enate, to p r o v i cl e f o r a submission of a resolution to the voters of the state to determine if they wanted the veto to be granted to the governor. It never got out of the committee, or if it did, it never got anywhere along the line. Well now, when we get enough people there, as we have now, to force a thing like that out. to where it is a vote, and the people in the legislature are forced to say John Jones, Jim Ba 1ey, this that and the other, they were agai nst it, and they know that it has been voted by the people of this state as the people want. You eventually get enough public pressure upon them until you get certain things. It takes enormous time and enormous pressure to do that, but you car, 4 9 accomplish It, and I believe we will do it. We will do it on some of the things. We got voting for the district judges because we had twenty-one people in the legislature, and they needed the vote for court reform.  That&#x27;s a perfect example. J H : So the Republic a n s then, appende cl t h a t a cl d I t i o n a 1 requirement for court reform that. . . , JB: They just wouldn&#x27;t vote for court reform until they got it, JH:  So the minority block could accomplish. , . . JB: There were a lot of them that didn&#x27;t want anything at all. A lot of the Democrats didn&#x27;t want anything at all, and the ones that wanted the court reform to go by, they said, &quot;Well, this is an improvement. It&#x27;s an I improvement even if we have to take the elections of district judges. It&#x27;s still an improvement. Now, we&#x27;re not going to get this at all if we don&#x27;t. . , .&quot; JH: Do you think the Democrats felt embarrassed about districts like the 17th Judicial District where the counties weren&#x27;t even contiguous, and it was a blatant affront to the concept of Democratic elections to begin with? JB: I think Democrats who were really interested in the proper kind ot government, yes, they probably were embarrassed, The ordinary Democratic politician was not embarrassed at all. If you could embarrass him, this Superior Court nomination and election of judges would do it. But you must bear in mind that you could go out here on the street and accost the first twenty -five people who come along and ask them about that, and you won&#x27;t 5 0 find one out of a hundred that knows. Well, they say, &quot;We elect judges.&quot; They don&#x27;t elect them at all. They just have the form of it that they elect them in a primary. They nominate them, They don&#x27;t elect them. The whole state group elects the judge, and it&#x27;s not a fair proposition to elect him, to nominate him, from just a little bitty group and then have everybody else voting on him. They don&#x27;t see him. They don&#x27;t know anything about him, How many of those judges did you know that you looked at on the ba 1 lot this time? JH: I never knew one, and I always feel guilty about it. Case in point. One of the issues that was a Republican issue, that was emphasized again and again and again, was either prohibition or a state referendum on alcoho1 in the thirties and the forties and even into the fifties. It occupied a prominent spot in all the platforms. Do you think the Republicans gained a lot of support because of that position or did they lose support, or was it a losing issue? Is that why it was dropped, or did feelings of the Party change about it so that it was eventually dropped in the fifties? JB: Well, it wasn&#x27;t so much a feeling in the Party. Society looks upn the prohibition issue entirely differently now from what they did twenty-five, thirty, forty, fifty years ago, How did they ever pass the Eighteenth Amendment? Well, they passed it because there were a lot of people against it, the 1i q uo r t hing, at that time. Theft t h e y reve rsed it. 3 ocIe ty sort of tempers you, your election i ssues, by what they ought to be . Now, you have   a great many of the leaders of the Democratic 5 1 Pa r t y c ha f i ng at the b i t a nd j ump i ng a rou nc! a nd be i ng v e r y critical and so forth because a lot of the, what they call the &quot;Born Again Christians,&quot; are voting the Republican ticket in the South, and voted it for Reagan and elected him. They went, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a terrible situation.&quot; They called us the Bible Belt. Well, does that help or does it hurt? In some instances, it carries elections. Why did the people of Michigan pass a refere n du m up there ag ai n st permitting abortions to be funded in any way by state funds, whether they were poor or rich? You can make the point that if a woman has had an abortion, the fact that she&#x27;s poor or rich doesn&#x27;t make the poor woman entitled to the same as the rich. But they passed it up there- In other words, they took an against-abortion stand. You say, &quot;Why did they do it? What docs that do?&quot; They did it because they thought it was a moral matter , a moral issue, and it is not any worse for a person to vote to have things done the way they want them on a moral issue than it is any other kind. I can understand why they would want, they gave a lot of trouble to Bush, talking about this 1 aw-and-order1 operation. I can understand why people wanted to vote for somebody that was strong in a 1 aw-and-order thing. And in the symbolic way that they called it to the attention of the people, why, they got it across. Take your gun thing, I&#x27;m not particu1 ar1y interested i n this NRA, that&#x27;s the gun problem where they claim that government i s goi ng to t a ke t he g un s awa y f r om e very bocl y a nd all t hat , and build that up and carry an election. Well, the only wav to do something about that, it seems to me like, is just to educate the 5 2 people.   And in some states they vote against us and in some states they don&#x27;t. You were talking about prohibition. I got off your subject. JH: No, you were bringing out another aspect of 11 which is i n teresting, but I d5dn&#x27; t phrase m y quest Ion v e ry well. 0 n e thing I wanted to get out was, was there a division between Democrats and Republicans on the prohibition issue, do you suspect? Were Republicans more in favor of prohibition and Democrats not? Or was it, from the polls I read in North Carolina during the thirties, there was substantial support for Prohibition, or at least an ABC r ef erendum, but the Republicans were really the only ones that trumpeted that issue? JB : I suppose that was a matter of usi ng what you had to w i 11 w i t h i f y o u c o u Id. I k n o w t h i s , I k n o w y o u h a v e a r e f e r e n d u m on ABC stores, and it will permit them to be established and be set up. Back in other days, they would have voted against it, They got to the point where the state took over and was making money out of it. You tell the people of this city here that the ABC stores ate making a lot of money out of It, and they&#x27;re going to keep yout taxes down, and I don&#x27;t give a damn what they think about it, they&#x27;re still going to vote to let them go ahead and do it. Why is that? Well, that&#x27;s just the nature of the human animal. They are not that interested in who gets drunk or doesn&#x27;t to where they would vote to eliminate i t, and they&#x27;d take the position that if that&#x27;s not going to cost anyhow, they&#x27;ll go on out and get it from the bootlegger.,. Oh, I&#x27;ve heard thai. You&#x27;ll  never  be  able  to  convince  me  that  when  you  make 5 3 intoxicating liquors more convenient to get, that more of it is not gotten than if you have to go out and deal with bootleggers. But that&#x27;s the argument. I don&#x27;t think if you really legislate morals, I don&#x27;t think you can put that much in a platform and be very effective. I know back in other days, there were a lot of people in other days that didn&#x27;t want any of these stores in their counties. Especially, there&#x27;s a difference in the people of Madison and Avery County and (                             ) and some of these little counties, a n d in going into Hecklen bu rg County as t o whether you want it or not. You put it in your platform. You can carry Mitchell County or Avery County. They&#x27;ll laugh at you in Mecklenburg, but you a s k wh y, and it&#x27;s just effective sometimes. Maybe they are used cynically by some of our- people who, what do they call it, manage the candidates, but ( ).   I don&#x27;t know how you can change it. JH: Were you disappointed with Lee Atwater&#x27;s campaign for G e or ge B u s h ? I s e n s e t h a t y o u r e g a f d h i m a s some w h a t , o r h i s campaign strategy, as a little cynical? Were you disappointed that he was named to the Chairmanship of the Republican National Committee by George Bush? J B : N o , 1 take the positio n that Ge o r g e B u s h k n ow s him b etter t h a n I do, a n c! h e has a right to d e s i g nate the o n e w h o goes in. I don&#x27;t know Lee Atwater. I don&#x27;t know anything about him. He was his manager , and he won. Now, I&#x27;m not necessarily for letting the end justify any means whatsoever. I. want it to b e d o n e i n a n h o n o r able manner . That&#x27;s w h / I w a s a g a i n s t the absentee ballot and all the frauds in elections.  I wouldn&#x27;t do 54 that, I don&#x27;t want that done. I don&#x27;t want to have things stolen from me or anybody else. I just don&#x27;t want that to be. . , , But there are strategies which you can employ that are perfectly decent and perfectly proper that are shrewd and are not dishonest. We&#x27;ve reache J a s ituation now that is far different from when if was, when TV was not available for us. I heard Senator Helms tell us one time when he came up here, and I&#x27;m not a d e v otee of him par t i c u 1 a r I y , a n d s c rn e t i m es he do e s t h i n g s t h a t I don&#x27;t like. 1 don&#x27;t just follow him blanket, but I do think he&#x27;s got lots of sense. And he knows how to press the proper power (                                 ) up there in Washington as well as anybody e1se.  ftead this book by that New York Times reporter, 3mi th, on who is, T think, the power game. It shows you how well Senator Helms knows how to press and do things to get things done for his purposes. JH: Some people say that he often overstates his case so much that he angers Republican leadership. I gather he almost lost t he a g ri cultura 1 bi1 1 at one point, but he di d pull It off, I guess you could say. J B : You will t i nd that he is as shr e wd as anybody. He is a master oi parliamentary tactics, an absolute master of it, and he knows where the bodies lie there too. Helms told us, in a meeting when he was up here on behalf of John East and needed to raise money and that sort of tiling, and he was {                                  ). They had two things tor- five minutes speeches of John East on TV. Joh ii wa s , he wa s a erac ker j ack speaker and made an e xt reme I y f a v o i- a b 1 e impress i on , a n d h e w a s v e r y a r t i c u late.   0 n e o f them 5 5 concerned the Panama Canal and the ins and outs of that. Another one, I&#x27;ve forgotten just what it was, but they were two cracker jack things in which he was setting out why he was against the Panama Cana 1 and conclemni ng those who were f or gi vi ng i t away - -at that ti me I don&#x27;t thin!; it had been given away--but intending against it at the time. And when Helms took the camera and put those two on and played them off (                                  ), he says, &quot;Now gentlemen, in today&#x27;s time, that is the election.&quot; More people would see that face on these television stations and in their homes where they can make their own decision- without people yelling around them. More people will see that than come to all their rallies and all the other meetings. Now, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to discourage anybody from going, but this is the television age, and the quicker that the Republican Party adjusts to that, the better they are.&quot;  I said, &quot;(                                      ) Jesse. We haven&#x27;t heard anything much yet, &quot; I said to a SB I man now that&#x27;s a Senator. They had a Senator there now. Who did East beat? JH:  East beat, not Morgan was it? JB; Yes, Bob Morgan. Bob Morgan was a household word. He was in the Senate and not unfavorable in his outlook. People 1 iked h i m. He&#x27;d been the, I think, Atto rney Ge n e r a 1 , and hs w a s in the Senate, and it looked like that was a certainty. You could have knocked me over with a feather when East won. We raised money arid did our little part, and they took that thing on all of the stations and so forth, and Morgan evidently didn&#x27;t get his answer or say anything about it, and beat Bob Morgan.  Now, 1 5G was the most surprised man in North Carolina. My God, how could y ou go wr ong wi t h T . V . Ma ybe t he y d i d n &#x27; t do i t a 1 1 wi th that little tiling. We&#x27;ve tun good races, but that was a time when the Republicans, . . . And of course, they had Reagan running, and that was a Rep ub1ican year. JH:  Sure, 1980 was a big year. J B : A R e p u bile a n y e a r , a b i g year. That w a s n &#x27; t t h e o h 1 y&#x27; reason, but how he beat Bob Morgan. ... He wasn&#x27;t up here but once. He spoke to us but one time. He made the best speech. There&#x27;s no question but that he&#x27;s smart. He made one of the best P o 1 11 i c a I spee c h e s on the issues t h e r e of the camp a i g n .

That&#x27;s not hardly anything in connection with w h a t t h e obligations a n d d uties o f a 3 enat o r a r e , a n d t h e y cl i d i t w 11 h h i rn.

JB:  Who had been dominant for years, JH: Let me just ask two more questions and one is, the phenomenon of, when you have Republican primaries, you had very few  people  participating  in  them,  and  the  logic  was  that c Republicans wanted to vote in the Democratic primaries to vote for eventual state winners, and this was accepted. A lot of Republican leaders, I guess, said they had friends who&#x27;d even vote in Democrati c pr i maries. JB: Well, you can&#x27;t vote in Democratic primaries unless you&#x27;re a registered Democratic. H is true that a lot of people who were nomi na 1 presi clenti a 1 Repub 1 i cans votecl i n the Democratic primary because they wanted to vote for or against the one they thought would be the winner and would be the one who would serve them. I can see how that would happen. They may then come back. They may have a preference between two parties in a Democratic primary. Generally, the Democrats ran one who was either liberal or conservative.  1hey had. . . . JH:  Two-party dynamies. JB: That&#x27;s right, and those who had a Republican inclination nationally could be registered Democratic, and they could vote for their preference there. J hi: One primary in particular is important in North Carolina politics, and a lot has been written about it, and that&#x27;s the Willis Smith-Frank Graham primary of 1950.

<dc:description>198 INTERVIEW 13 August 27, 1997 FRANCES WEAVER: This is an interview with Henry Toole Clark, first administrator of the Division of Health Affairs at the University of North Carolina. The interview is taking place at Dr. Clark&#x27;s home in Carol Woods in Chapel Hill. The date is August 27, 1997. My name is Frances Weaver. Henry, when we last talked you had begun your sabbatical year with a two months family vacation in Chapel Hill during July and August 1966. You reported that your three teen-age children had a good summer in state-wide swimming competition and that you, too, had had a good summer in state-wide tennis competition. But you were ready to get back to work when those athletics events had ended. What happened next? HENRY TOOLE CLARK: Fran, on Sept. 1,1965 I began a seven months stint as a special advisor to Dr. James Shannon, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, on the implementation of PL 89-239 (the Regional Medical Programs Legislation). Let me set the stage a bit for our discussion. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been in existence for many years, but their main growth and influence came during the 1950s and 1960s when Jim Shannon was the Director. The times were made for the man. During the early 1940s the sulfa drugs and then penicillin became available to give hope that the dreaded infectious diseases could be conquered. This idea became more credible in the early 1950s when Jonas Salk developed a vaccine which promised to eradicate poliomyelitis. The American people began to believe that medical research, if properly supported, could solve most of their health problems. Parallel to this development, during this same era, thousands of local organizations came into being to raise money and provide care for local citizens with specific diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, mental illness and more. Jim Shannon had the imagination, the political savvy and the leadership qualities to convert the national leaders of those grass roots voluntary agencies into a huge lobby which persuaded Congress to provide increasing sums of money to NIH to support research in these diseases which were of major local concern. The National Institutes, in turn, made grants to researchers, mostly based in Schools of Medicine around the USA, which gradually transformed the USA Schools of Medicine into research institutes which became the envy of medical scientists around the world. As the years went by and more and more money for medical research became available, most faculty members rejoiced because they were working at the exciting cutting edge of science and, in addition, the rewards system, in terms of recognition by peers, choice appointments, promotions and salary increases, was heavily weighted toward individuals with research productivity. But, Fran, even some very good things, such as medical research, can produce problems if carried to excess. A small but growing number of key observers on the national health scene, including a few medical deans, developed concerns because the huge emphasis on research was reducing the equally desirable focus on teaching. Even more important to some people, the fruits of research were not being made readily available to the people at the crossroads and in the inner-cities, where they were urgently needed and where there were tens of thousands of people across the country without adequate medical care. Even among university presidents this vastly expanding research activity was producing new problems because it required new buildings and CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 199 equipment and general university staff support whose costs were not fully covered in the research grants. In this context, Public Law 89-239 represented a new type of law and a new challenge in its administration for the National Institutes of Health. FW: Why was that the case, Henry? HC: Well, let&#x27;s consider briefly the history and main thrust of PL 89-239, the Regional Medical Programs Legislation. In March 1964 President Lyndon Johnson appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael De Bakey &quot;to develop a realistic battle plan leading to the ultimate conquest of three diseases heart disease, cancer and stroke.&quot; These diseases collectively caused about 60% of the deaths of US citizens each year. That commission labored mightily, collected a huge amount of data on the devastating effects of these three diseases across the country and submitted its report to the President in December 1964. That report served as the basis for companion administrative bills which were introduced in both houses of Congress in January 1965. During the following months there were extended hearings on these bills in both houses of Congress. Gradually the emphasis changed from the initial categorical focus on heart disease, cancer and stroke. In the final analysis, the legislation called for each of the 100 university medical centers across the USA to serve as the central element and leadership force in developing a more effective overall medical care program for its surrounding region. Thus the Regional Medical Programs Legislation was born and signed as Public Law 89-239 on October 6, 1965. The fact is there were some striking similarities in the rationale of the Sanger Report, which played such a big part in the North Carolina legislation of 1947 and 1949 creating the Division of Health Affairs at UNC, and the basic message of PL 89-239 in 1965 for the 100 university medical centers across the USA. In both cases the universities were asked to study the health needs of all the people of their health service areas, to develop a plan of action to meet those needs in conjunction with the area providers and consumers, and to coordinate the implementation of those plans. This would create a major new function for schools of medicine beyond their traditional roles in teaching and research. FW: So you felt the legislative hearings leading to the enactment of the Regional Medical Programs legislation really represented a &quot;Sanger Report&quot; which presented a new challenge to all the medical schools in the country? HC: Yes, Fran. And I felt, too, it was a high personal compliment, and also poetic justice, to be asked by Jim Shannon to serve for a time as his personal advisor on the implementation of PL 89-239. I had tried hard for fifteen years at UNC to get the School of Medicine and the University Administration to begin to fulfill their commitments made in 1947 and 1949 to implement the state-wide service concept embodied in the N.C. state legislation creating the Division of Health Affairs. I had been disparaged by the Medical Dean and given little support by the top University administration for my efforts in this regard. Having been, in effect, rejected by my &quot;home folks&quot; in my own state, I was now being asked to provide guidance for the implementation of essentially similar legislation passed by Congress involving a challenge to 100 universities serving the country! My first thought at the time was: &quot;A prophet is not without honor, save in his own land.&quot; My further reaction was: &quot;What a pity we in Chapel Hill had not moved beyond developing an outstanding teaching and research institute during 1950-65!&quot; If we had also developed a statewide regional medical program, as envisioned by Sanger, we would have rendered a distinctive service to the people of North Carolina. But more important, we might have provided a model CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 200 for the development of effective regional medical programs across the USA beginning in 1965. And we would have achieved world distinction in creating a University Health Center that was both teaching and research oriented and &quot;a service facility for the whole state.&quot; My seven months assignment with Dr. Shannon was an intensive work experience, but it was an exciting personal adventure. I developed a substantial report and set of recommendations on schedule and with less difficulty than I had anticipated. Since I had been focusing on this subject field for almost twenty years, I knew first hand most of the fragmentary programs in medical regionalization in the USA and their leaders. However, for the first three months of my new assignment I traveled extensively to confer with those leaders about PL 89-239, and with other key people in a scatter of universities, in a variety of voluntary health agencies and organizations, in the main national health foundations and in the federal government who had s strong interest in this new law. Based on my own experiences and the gleanings from my travels and with helpful advice from an old colleague, Conrad Seipp, whom I&#x27;d first met in Puerto Rico, I developed a preliminary report to Shannon and distributed it in December 1965 to about 100 of my contacts and friends, inviting their comment. Then, in turn, based on the return comments of those people, I developed a final report for Shannon in February 1966. During my three months of travel to gather information with which to prepare my report I had had easy access to key leaders in health affairs everywhere. This was due to the fact that I was serving, in a sense, as the personal envoy of Jim Shannon and, furthermore, I was seeking their comments on federal legislation which had the potential to add a whole new dimension to the functioning of schools of medicine. I had many fascinating individual conferences. For the most part, medical school faculty members, and especially the researchers, were wary of PL 89-239 and concerned that its implementation would weaken the focus on research which was their prime interest. A few deans were excited by the potentials of the new legislation but many sounded a note of dismay with the comment that &quot;I have more challenges than I can handle and now this is being added!&quot; On the other hand, most medical administrators and most spokesmen for foundations, government and the general public strongly supported PL 89-239 and hoped it would have a successful implementation. In retrospect, a conference with Dr. Ward Darley has a special place in my memory. Early on, Darley had served as Dean of the School of Medicine at Colorado, then President of that University, then for a number of years as Executive Director of the Association of American Medical Colleges before retiring in Denver. I had known him casually earlier but sensed he was something of a kindred spirit when I visited him in Denver in the fall of 1965. He endorsed the objectives of the new legislation but doubted that many schools of medicine would have the commitment or the leadership personnel to implement it in an effective way. He hoped that a few would do so and point the way, in time, for the rest. As our conversation unfolded he endorsed my idealism but indicated he was not surprised I had had problems at UNC, as I might have had in many other medical schools around the country. He hoped schools of medicine would evolve along the lines I was thinking. My final report of February 1966 to Dr. Shannon seemed so substantive and timely to the editor of the Journal of Medical Education (the official journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges) that he reopened the April 1966 issue of that Journal, which had already gone to press, and published it in its entirety in that issue. That article was entitled &quot;The Challenge of the Regional Medical Programs Legislation&quot;. A companion article also appeared in the February 1966 issue of Hospitals, the journal of the American Hospital Association, entitled &quot;Shaping the Hospital for its Future Role&quot;. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 201 During my seven months&#x27; period of service for NIH I found Dr. Shannon quite interested in and supportive of what I was doing and he accepted my final report with appreciation. I was somewhat relieved by that fact since the substance of my report, which related primarily to the interactions of schools of medicine with many community agencies and practitioners, was very foreign to his primary focus on in-house medical research. My main contacts and supporters at NIH during the seven months period were Jack Masur, the Director of the Clinical Center, whom we have talked about on several occasions, and Dr. Stuart Sessoms, the Deputy Director of NIH. Stuart was a rockribbed Tar Heel, a graduate of the UNC School of Pharmacy and the Medical College of Virginia, who became a good friend. I was deeply gratified that both Jack and Stuart felt I had done a good job and had presented to their boss just what he needed in the way of analysis and advice. FW: Henry, in our last interview you indicated that in May 1966 Dr. Sessoms asked you to consider a two year appointment at NIH to help activate the RMP legislation. Why didn&#x27;t you accept that appointment? HC: I think partly because the legislation was still being actively debated in Congress and it was quite unclear what would ultimately be enacted; partly because my future at UNC was still unsettled and I was not prepared to make a firm commitment elsewhere at that point; partly because I did not feel the prospect of living in Washington and being a part of the political whirl was very attractive; and partly because I had some doubts that NIH, with its focus so heavily on medical research, would administer the RMP legislation in the most effective way. I think my concerns in this last regard were at least partially justified by subsequent events. Fran, I have been focusing in this discussion on the broader context in which my recommendations for the implementation of the Regional Medical Programs legislation were developed. My vision and actual recommendations in this regard are contained in the two journal articles I have cited, which are a part of my library papers. And there are dozens of letters, too, from key health professionals across the country giving their reactions to those articles. I urge any interested person to consult those sources. I completed my work for Dr. Shannon on March 31, 1966, but near the time of my departure I was given some information from his deputy, Stuart Sessoms, which warmed my heart. I was told my name was on a &quot;short list&quot; at the White House to Chair an upcoming White House Conference on Health which, at that point, had not been officially scheduled. It was the custom for a decade or so in the 1950s and 1960s for the White House to stage a major conference on a specific health topic every two or three years, with national health leaders and selected members of Congress in attendance, to set the stage and pave the way for a new round of health legislation. It was a high honor to be considered for the Chair of such a conference, though to tell the truth, Fran, I don&#x27;t recall now if and when another White House Conference was actually staged. As the end of March approached I turned my full attention to making plans to spend my next six months as a resident consultant at the University of Leiden in Holland in fulfillment of my commitment there. However, my involvement with the RMP legislation was not destined to phase out but, instead, was very soon to deepen. My two journal articles which appeared in February and April 1966 produced a wave of excitement in many medical schools across the country and I received several inquiries about my possible interest in directing regional medical programs in various states. We will be talking soon about two of those inquiries, one from Russ Nelson at Johns Hopkins and a second from Dr. Vernon Lippard, the Dean of Medicine at Yale. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 202 FW: All right, Henry. You have finished your assignment with Dr. Shannon and are beginning to focus on an exciting job in Holland. What were your thoughts as you moved from one challenging situation to another? HC: Well Fran, first I felt a sense of satisfaction at what others seemed to feel was a good job I had done for Shannon. But, beyond that, I was looking forward to spending six months in Leiden for several reasons. I was aware that some of our forefathers, the Pilgrims, had spent about 20 years in Leiden just before crossing the ocean and landing on Plymouth Rock in 1620 and that made Leiden a special place to visit. I knew that the university of Leiden, including its medical elements, had been founded in 1575 and it had developed though the centuries as one of the great universities of western Europe. So I would be working with a very prestigious university. Furthermore, I felt this assignment could provide a great family adventure for the Clarks. And so it did! FW: What were the main challenges you faced as a visiting consultant starting off in Leiden? HC: First, from a personal standpoint, I had to adapt quickly to living and working in a European setting where the language and many of the customs were quite different from mine. However, I found my Dutch hosts were tremendously understanding and helpful to me in this regard. Holland is a very small country, and most of its 12,000,000 citizens at that time, and especially those with whom I had my primary contacts, had traveled extensively throughout western Europe and some to Dutch colonies far beyond. They made an adventure of adapting to a variety of cultural patterns, and they took pleasure in introducing me to their own. My adjustment was simplified by the fact that everyone with whom I was associated could speak fluent English. Indeed, in Holland most of the children are taught four languages in school i.e. Dutch, English, French and German. My adaptation to living in Holland was further simplified by the fact that almost all the Dutchmen with whom I was associated had a great sense of humor, a great zest for living and a deep feeling of respect for the USA. They felt we had turned the tide for the Allies in World War II and, in their terms had &quot;given them their freedom.&quot; So, Fran, my adaptation to life in Holland turned out to be more of a delightful adventure than a struggle. FW: But you must have had some major challenges on the professional side. HC: Yes - but here, too, my new Dutch friends helped to make life easier for me. The fact is that in the mid 1960s most of the European countries were still emerging from the destruction and other devastating effects of World War II. Most of the focus during the twenty years following the war was on rebuilding the industrial bases of those countries where land battles and air raids during the war had been so destructive. Relatively little money had been available for educational and social programs. In the meantime, our USA universities and especially our Schools of Medicine, had prospered and their teaching and research programs had become recognized as the best in the world. As a visiting American consultant I was viewed with apprehension by a few of the older members of the medical faculty at Leiden. However, for the most part the faculty respected my American background and me, personally, and were anxious to hear what I had to say. My first task at Leiden was to get acquainted with the existing programs in the School of Medicine and Hospital so that I would be aware of strengths and weaknesses and major differences from our programs in the USA. There were some surprising differences. For example, students in Holland entered Medical School from their equivalent of our high school. Their medical curriculum covered 6 to 7 years and encompassed parts of what our medical students gain in their undergraduate college studies. There was no limit in Holland at that time CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 203 on the number of students who could start out in medical school and the large entering numbers placed a heavy burden on the faculty. Many students were weeded out during the first two years by academic failure and for other reasons. Their post graduate training program was roughly comparable to our intern and residency training program, but, with a smaller faculty, there was less one on one teaching and, it seemed to me, less focus on the use of patients for teaching. Research was important but not as extensive as back home. Almost all of the operating funds came from the national government with little supplementation from voluntary sources. In this context, let me turn to the situation on my arrival in April 1966. This, in most respects, was similar to that which existed in 1936, just prior to WW II because very little had changed. The School of Medicine and Hospital were composed of about 30 free standing institutes housing, on the one hand, the basic science departments of the School of Medicine and, on the other hand, a variety of specialty and sub-specialty clinical departments. These clinical departments were, in effect, little hospitals. Most of these buildings were out-dated and sadly in need of repair and much of the equipment was out of date. This wide dispersal of operating programs, especially those serving patients, produced some costly operating inefficiencies. For example, there were 10 X-Ray departments functioning in the Leiden medical complex, 6 sets of surgical operating suites, a large number of emergency departments, a widely dispersed medical library, etc., etc. This pattern made ineffective use of many highly skilled professional and technical personnel and it required much duplication of costly equipment. Moreover, there were problems in transporting patients back and forth for diagnostic studies and treatment procedures when they had medical problems that involved more than one medical specialty. The physical layout I have described also posed some serious limitations on the teaching and research programs, especially with regard to staging multidisciplinary activities. To compound the problem, there had been no effective administrative mechanism in the past to address many problems as they arose, to recognize and take advantage of larger opportunities and to chart the overall development of the medical center. The main authority at Leiden - and, I think, in most Western European Schools of Medicine at that time - was vested in the Department Head (the Professor!) and the uneven programs which resulted reflected the varied personalities and imaginations and drives of these men. The Dean of Medicine was elected annually for a one year term to serve, in effect, as Chairman of a group of department heads and he had little authority of his own. The situation I am describing at Leiden was essentially the same at the other six Schools of Medicine in Holland. All of the schools looked to the central government of Holland for their main financing. By doing some advanced planning the Leiden faculty hoped to obtain early consideration in governmental circles for having its needs met. FW: Henry, that sounds like a chaotic situation! How on earth did you proceed? HC: Fran, fortunately a very important first step had been taken before I arrived. Several months earlier Russ Nelson had visited Leiden at the request of the Chairman of the Hospital Board of Trustees and on Russ&#x27; recommendation a joint Trustee-Directorate, representing both the University and Hospital Boards of Trustees, had been created to take the overall responsibility for planning. A prominent industrialist, who was also a Minister in the national government, was made Chairman. That man, Mr. van den Bergh, was quite familiar with hospital care in the USA - indeed, he had an American wife - and it was obvious to him that the current situation in the medical center at Leiden was an inefficient and out-dated operation. He played the lead role in creating a planning committee made up of representatives of the medical CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 204 faculty, the hospital administration and the university administration with Dr. Henry Veeneklaas, the Professor of pediatrics and the out-going Dean of Medicine, as Chairman. During my six months in Holland I got well acquainted, professionally and personally, with a substantial number of medical faculty members and others, but my primary contact was with Henk Veeneklaas. He was a wonderful working partner and became a life-long good friend. Henk was a very bright, dynamic, warm person with a great sense of humor who was not only well liked and respected by his colleagues but was also well known throughout Holland. He had been a senior officer in the Dutch Resistance Forces in World War II and, indeed, was one of only two civilians who had been decorated by the Dutch Queen for the role he played in that connection. I was fascinated by his stories of his experiences during World War II. When I arrived in Holland, the Veeneklaas Committee had had a few meetings and had reached some tentative conclusions, with Russ Nelson&#x27;s help, on a few objectives or principles. However, it was stuck on what to do next. The basic assumptions or &quot;Starting Points&quot; reached by the Committee included the following: (A) An entering class of 200 medical students (B) An ultimate 1000 bed University Hospital (C) The need for a construction budget of about $60,000,000 (D) Top priorities in construction: Surgery, Psychiatry, Pediatrics (E) Allowance in planning for phased construction and future expansion (F) Studies to include future use of existing buildings (G) Studies to identify potential developments in health sciences for the next 20 years so that site planning could prepare for future desired relationships Fran, these tentative &quot;Starting Points&quot; were discussed at some length during my early meetings with the Planning committee, and they were formalized as &quot;guiding principles&quot;. Those discussions contributed greatly to my understanding of the overall Leiden situation and the role I needed to play. Before long I became convinced that an overall long range plan for the University of Leiden Medical Center should be developed which would project much more than a new central University Hospital. However, I felt a new central Hospital was the greatest single need and my Dutch associates were already prepared to focus on that. I thought that in the course of planning the hospital I could introduce a host of other topics which they should begin to address. Following a regular planning committee meeting on a Friday in late April, Henk Veeneklaas and Max Jongsma, the latter being the Hospital Director, indicated that the committee members were getting a little restless and we needed a work plan for the May-September period of my stay in Holland. I promised to present such a plan on the following Monday. On Monday, May 1, 1966,1 gave Henk and Max a detailed plan of action, entitled &quot;A New University Hospital for Leiden&quot;, which I had prepared over the week-end with substantial help from Blanche as critic and typist. She had recently come to Holland for a short visit. That plan presented the following targets: (1) By late September 1966 (which was the end of my projected stay in Holland) we should have in hand the first schematic plans for the new hospital (2) At that time, too, we should hope to have information on the money available for first stage construction (3) At the same time, the permanent organization for effective long range planning and implementation should be established with an adequate support budget. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 205 Now, in order to achieve those targets I indicated that the Planning Committee must develop tentative program objectives for each department of both the basic sciences and the clinical sciences plus a number of hospital support services by early July in order for an architect to have the data with which to proceed with his work. Furthermore, I proposed the immediate appointment of 45 faculty and administrative study committees to assist the planning committee to assemble this data. In my written plan of action, I spelled out the charge that would be given to each of the 45 committees. Finally, I indicated that an architect should be appointed immediately in order to get acquainted with the existing elements in the medical center as a base line for planning the future hospital. Also, that this architect should become a member of the planning committee and both contribute to and gain from its discussions. My proposed plan of action is presented in detail in a 12 page statement of May 1,1966 which is among my library papers. FW: Henry, that seems like a logical plan of action. But you were proposing an awesome amount of work for many people in a short period of time, especially when I think back on your planning experiences in Puerto Rico and Chapel Hill. What was the reaction of Dr. Veeneklaas and Dr. Jongsma to your proposed plan of action? HC: Henk and Max were stunned by the amount of work I was proposing for a five month period, though they saw clearly the logic of my plan. However, their first reaction was along different lines. They were awed that, with Blanche&#x27;s help, I had produced over a holiday week-end a detailed plan of action for our whole enterprise, with working assignments spelled out for 45 committees. They seemed to feel that if two visiting Americans could work with that commitment and intensity, by golly, they could, too. However, after reflection, Henk Veeneklaas indicated that the most difficult part of my proposal was that all of the faculty of the School of Medicine was scheduled to take summer holidays during the very time I was proposing committee activities. Besides that, most of the faculty felt that the whole planning effort would very likely prove to be an empty exercise that would not produce any significant results. Henk and Max wondered how on earth we could make believers out of a skeptical faculty and gain their full participation. Fran, I then thought of a step I could take which, if successful, would not only win the hearts of the Planning Committee and Faculty but would also move the planning process a giant step forward. I went to see Mr. van den Bergh and told him that his assessment of the need for a new hospital at Leiden was quite sound, that a good planning committee had been activated and we had developed a good plan of action. However, many of the faculty, whose help was essential, thought the whole approach might well be an empty exercise. I told him his help was needed to bring the whole project to life. I suggested three steps for Mr. van den Bergh. First, he should help gain governmental approval for the immediate appointment of an architect. Second, he should gain governmental approval for me to take the Planning Committee on a 10 day trip to visit several East Coast, USA medical centers. Third, he and Mrs. van den Bergh should lead the travel party. My ploy was successful beyond my wildest dreams. I think Mr. van den Bergh saw in the situation a rare opportunity to demonstrate his own commitment and command. Authorization for two architects was soon obtained, one a practitioner with hospital planning experience, and the other from the faculty of a Dutch school of architecture. They soon began to attend Planning Committee meetings and to get acquainted with existing facilities. Furthermore, authorization was obtained for the planning committee to go to the USA for a 10 day visit. To my deep gratification that travel party was expanded to include the two architects, the President- CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 206 Curator of the University of Leiden, and senior representatives of both the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Education in Holland. Mr. and Mrs. van den Bergh became, ex-officio, the leaders of the travel party. When the medical faculty at Leiden became aware that two architects had been appointed and that a large delegation from Leiden plus architects plus two senior Dutch Ministry officials would soon be visiting the United States to study selected medical centers there, they became convinced that &quot;something was going to happen&quot; as a result of the planning activity under way. In turn, they began to rearrange their vacation plans in order to fulfill their committee assignments. The month of May was spent in activating the 45 faculty committees I had proposed and putting them to work. I also telephoned Russ Nelson in Baltimore to get his help in developing plans for the Dutch group to visit University Medical centers at Yale, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, the National Institutes of Health and Penn State (the last under construction at Hershey, Pa.). The tour was scheduled to conclude at UNC in Chapel Hill where I would be the host. The visit to the USA by the Dutch group, which was taken in mid-June, was a spectacular success. The presentations by the USA host universities were well organized, with senior spokesmen in each instance, mostly my long term friends who were members of either the Society of Medical Administrators or the Association of Academic Health Centers. The typical visit featured a morning program for the entire group which covered the organizational structure and financing of the center being visited, the scope of the programs in teaching, research and patient care and both internal relationships between programs and external relations with the broader community. A luncheon followed which allowed for some one-on-one discussion and socializing. Then in the afternoon the visiting team dispersed with some faculty members visiting individual departments but most of the visitors focusing on the University Hospital. In some situations there was a late afternoon cocktail party or dinner after which the visiting team prepared to move on to the next visit site. Fran, I really think the highlight of the trip for the Dutchmen was the concluding stopover in Chapel Hill where they were introduced to our Division of Health Affairs during a full day and this was followed by cocktails and a buffet supper in our home. Following supper, the whole group, exhausted from its ten day travel experience, sprawled in chairs and on the floor of our sunken living room while Bob House entertained the visitors with a few musical selections on his harmonica and then Bill Friday talked informally about UNC, Chapel Hill and North Carolina. The Dutch visitors were charmed - and several responded with some special remarks of their own. On returning to Holland the members of the planning committee dispersed to join a number of faculty study committees and assist in developing preliminary program reports by the target date of early July. With those reports in hand the architects began to take steps to develop early schematic plans for the new University Hospital. In the meantime the Clarks&#x27; great family adventure was about to begin. I remained in Chapel Hill after the Dutch visiting group departed and helped Blanche bank the fires and pack up for a two months&#x27; visit to Holland by the whole family. Before departing from Holland for the USA I had arranged, with the help of some American Embassy friends, to sublet half of a large duplex residence in The Hague for the months of July and August. The owner, who was the top General Motors representative in Holland, was going to the USA on vacation. The Clarks departed the USA on June 22 with London being our first destination. A good friend from Boston had been given two tickets to the Wimbledon tennis matches by Roy Emerson, one CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 207 of the great Australian tennis stars of that era; so the Clarks were privileged to spend one day as his guests at that magical spot watching the play on Center Court. Another good friend from Boston, who had been a medical classmate in Rochester and was a fine tennis player, had suggested earlier that he and I enter the senior doubles competition at Wimbledon (which he later did!). But after some soul searching I decided, with an aching heart, that in fairness to my Leiden friends I could not commit the two weeks that would have required. The Clarks moved on to Holland after 2-3 days in London and the Veeneklaases turned over their lovely private lake cottage near Leiden to us while we waited for the duplex in The Hague to become available on July 1. The move into our new quarters was filled with high drama. In the process of moving in, one of the Clarks inadvertently locked the front door with the only key inside. In a gallant attempt to save the day, our 16 year old son climbed up on some vines and a trellis to the second floor in search of a possible open window, which he found, but it so happened that he entered a bedroom of the other half of the duplex where the Dutch maid was making up a bed. While this episode threatened to upset the good relationship between the USA and Holland, it was settled amiably with a full explanation and lots of laughter. The fact is that our Dutch neighbors had never even met our landlords who had lived next door for a year or two and they thought, at first, that we were them. FW: Henry, I&#x27;ve been thinking during our interviews that you may have had some ups and downs through the years but your life has never been dull! HC: You are right, Fran. Sometimes my dreams have been too big and too idealistic but even my failures have been exciting. And there have been some wonderful personal adventures along the way. However, let&#x27;s turn back to my work in Holland which resumed on July 1. During the early days of July the 45 faculty and administrative Committees submitted their preliminary reports which outlined their program projections. The Planning Committee reviewed these, added some points of its own and turned them over to the architects for study and beginning work on preparing a preliminary schematic plan for the new 1000 bed university hospital. This by no means completed the functioning of the 45 sub-committees because the architects had questions on some aspects of their reports and the Planning Committee also had questions. So many of the committees continued to function for many months. Also, I raised other, larger issues for consideration. Among the issues I raised for the Planning Committee, for example, were the following: Should the University of Leiden project the development of a university level School of Nursing (there was none in Holland at the time)? I postulated that such a school would prepare faculty for many hospital schools of Nursing throughout Holland, and directors of nursing service for those same hospitals. I asked, too, if the University of Leiden, with the same rationale, should also create a School of the Allied Health Sciences. Also, should programs in Dentistry, Pharmacy and Public Health be considered? And how much of the teaching of medical students could and should be carried out in other hospitals and patient care settings in the Leiden area? And, if these and other important health affairs developmental issues were to be addressed in an effective way, wasn&#x27;t it necessary to provide the leadership of a full-time, long-term dean or perhaps &quot;Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs&quot; who also had available a full time planning staff? So, Fran, gradually my role in Holland changed from a focus on planning a new university hospital to conceptualizing a future overall university health center in the context of its larger community. This expanded assignment was one that I engineered because I felt it was what the folks in Leiden really needed, and it was fostered by the larger vision of university medical center operations which the Dutch delegation gained during its visit to the USA. This CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 208 larger assignment did not preclude planning a new university hospital as the first element of an expanded medical center, though it did introduce many important additional elements to consider in that planning activity. And it was fully in keeping with the last of the Planning Committee&#x27;s &quot;Starting Points,&quot; which stated that &quot;Studies would identify potential development in health sciences for the next 20 years so that site planning could prepare for future desired relationships.&quot; In this context, planning activity proceeded during the July-September period with the architects working to develop the first schematics of an &quot;ideal&quot; 1000 bed hospital and the Planning Committee responding to their requests for information. The vision of the Planning Committee and architects was expanded further, too, during mid-July when the whole group spent two days in London visiting John Weeks, the leading British hospital architect of that era. This was followed in early August by a similar group visit to the University of Free Berlin to get acquainted with the facilities and staff of a new university hospital in Berlin which had just been constructed with the help of the Benjamin Franklin Foundation in the USA, with Russ Nelson as the primary consultant. Fran, during the visit to Berlin it was fascinating to observe the tense interaction between the Dutch and German doctors, because several of the Dutch physicians and one of the architects had been prisoners of war in Germany during World War II. However, by the second day of the visit the initial tension has eased and the two parties were productively engaged in active discussions of medical matters. On returning from Berlin the Planning Committee decided to take a vacation during the second half of August, with the expectancy that the architects would continue their work. This meant the Clark family also had two weeks available for vacation. Henk Veeneklaas and Jet, his wife - bless them - took matters in hand and planned a two week automobile trip for us to include special highlights in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium. The first day we traveled in tandem up the Rhine River and along part of the Romantic Road to stay over night in the lovely medieval walled city of Rothenburg. The second day we traveled through Bavaria to the picturesque village of Stine-aum-Rhine in Switzerland, where we all went swimming in the Rhine itself. The third day we crossed Switzerland to the small village of Samedan, near St. Moritz, where Henk Veeneklaas owned a vacation cottage, and the Clarks climbed their own small Alp, the Piz Padella. The fourth day the Clarks were set free to travel to Florence, Rome, the Amalfi Coast, the Isle of Capri, the western Riviera coast of Italy, across France to Paris and then across Belgium back to The Hague. Our travels took place during peak vacation time in Western Europe and we made no advance reservations anywhere, but with Henk Veeneklaas&#x27; coaching and our growing sophistication with regard to overseas travel we found lovely, modest accommodations every night and had a series of thrilling travel adventures. We left our older daughter and son behind in Paris for 2-3 days for a little independent vacation of their own. FW: Henry, all that sounds great. But at that point you were approaching the end of your commitment to Leiden. What were the main results of your work assignment there? HC: Fran, let me say first, that Blanche and our three children returned to Chapel Hill in late August while I stayed in Holland to complete my work and bank the fires there. I should mention here that I had resigned from UNC in mid-July to accept a position, effective October 1, 1966, as Director of the Connecticut Regional Medical Program, with a base at Yale and joint appointments as Visiting Professor of Medical Care in the Yale School of Medicine and Visiting Professor of Community Medicine at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. The Connecticut RMP was to be developed under the joint sponsorship of those two Schools of Medicine. Blanche had her hands full during September in closing out our affairs in Chapel Hill CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 209 and planning to move to Connecticut. Laura, age 18, entered UNC as a freshman in early September. In turn, Toolie, age 17, left Chapel Hill in early September to return to Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts for his senior year. Anne (age 14) posed a problem because she was a rising ninth grader and we would not reach New Haven until October 1, well after the start of the school year there. Back in Holland, the Planning Committee reconvened on Sept. 1 and resumed its meetings with the architects. The various members of the Committee were also heavily occupied with their professional duties in launching a new school year. As one assignment I was asked to summarize my numerous short &quot;sermons&quot; during my time in Holland, which suggested ways in which the University of Leiden could and should move beyond the construction of a new university hospital to fulfill its own larger creative potential in the health field in the years ahead, and render its greatest service to the people of The Netherlands. I focused on preparing this statement and presented to the Planning Committee a 20 page document on Sept. 9, 1966. In the first half of this document I identified potential developments in the fields of education, research, patient care and community service which they should consider and cited the need for continuing, sustained long range planning at the University of Leiden. In the second half of the document, I discussed the relevance of all this for the Planning Committee, for the Faculty of Medicine, for the University and Hospital Trustees, for other Faculties of Medicine in Holland, for governmental leaders and for all the citizens of Holland. I concluded with some comments&#x27; about my own heartwarming experiences in Holland during the previous 5 months and my thanks to many people, especially Henk Veeneklaas. The Committee&#x27;s response was that its members would use my report as an agenda and reference Bible in the months ahead. I had kept Russ Nelson fully informed about my larger vision for the future University of Leiden Medical Center and the fact that the Planning Committee was becoming increasingly aware that its concerns were broader than the planning of a new university hospital. He, in turn, gave strong support to my position with the comment- &quot;If the present willingness to plan at this scope continues and the involved ministries in Holland can be persuaded to implement a bigger plan, there is no doubt in my mind that Leiden University will be well in advance of other universities, not only in Holland but, probably, in all of Europe.&quot; Fran, let&#x27;s turn back to the target objectives I had outlined in my May 1, 1966 &quot;Plan of Action&quot; and summarize where matters stood as I prepared to wind up my affairs at Leiden in mid-September. First, the architects I had recommended on May 1 had been appointed promptly and had been working actively to develop the first schematics of an &quot;ideal&quot; university hospital for Leiden. These were expected to be available by late September. Second, the 45 committees I had recommended had been activated and had produced much of the program data needed by the Planning Committee and the architects. Third, the money available for the first stage of construction had not been determined by the Dutch government. Indeed, the central government had given first priority to the creation of a new Faculty of Medicine and teaching hospital in Rotterdam and was assigning all available funds to that venture for the time being. However, Leiden had established a strong linkage with key central government officials during the course of the trip to the USA, and Leiden seemed to be in a good position to have its needs addressed at an early date. Fourth, The Planning Committee was now well established and its members comfortable in their roles. And it was prepared to assume a larger function than that originally contemplated. I was not personally concerned by the fact that the Government of Holland had not assigned funds for first stage hospital construction by September 1966. While the first schematics for the new hospital would be available at that time, the site for the new hospital had CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 210 not been determined and a lot of additional study was required to determine what existing facilities would be torn down to make that site available and what new program elements should be projected. A master site plan was needed, such as we had developed in Chapel Hill and this would require considerable study and time to develop. Henk Veeneklaas was aware that I was scheduled to take a new job in New Haven on October 1, 1966, and he was helpful in arranging for me to make an early departure from Leiden. My last 10 days or so in Leiden involved discussions with the Planning Committee about how it should proceed to consider a larger role in health affairs for the University of Leiden. As one step in this regard, a major Boerhaave Conference was projected for December 1966 in Leiden with the leadership in health affairs in Holland plus key government officials and selected guests from other European countries, as invited participants. The three day event would be planned and staged along the lines of the White House Conferences on Health in the USA. The theme of the first conference was &quot;to consider the essential elements of the modern University Medical center and its role in Society.&quot; Russ Nelson and I were asked to supply four speakers from the USA - a prominent University president, a senior official in the Association of American Medical Colleges and the two of us -to keynote the four working sessions. The Planning Committee would recruit four responders from the European health community. As finally staged, that conference was so successful that a second was held in 1967 and the expectation at that point was that it would become an annual affair. The details about these conferences are available in my library papers. Fran, my last meeting with the Planning Committee occurred on Sept. 16, 1966 and it took the form, more or less, of a farewell party. Henk Veeneklass read and presented to me a three page &quot;fairy tale&quot; which described in considerable detail and with good humor my six months&#x27; experience in Holland from their standpoint. This was highly complimentary and reflected their view of what I had hoped to accomplish and what they had learned from me. After Henk finished each member of the Planning Committee added his own personal comment. This was a very special and heartwarming occasion, indeed, for me. Following that meeting I wrapped up my personal affairs in Leiden, made arrangements to ship an automobile to the USA and boarded a plane for home on Sept. 20, 1966. Fran, though we have discussed my Leiden experience at some length, there is much more information in my library papers. For anyone interested, I think the most substantive documents are my May 1, 1966 paper entitled &quot;A New University Hospital for Leiden&quot; in which I presented a Plan of Action for the next five months, my statement of Sept. 9, 1966 which I described a few minutes ago and Henk Veeneklaas&#x27; letter to me of Sept. 16, 1966 which I have just cited. FW: Henry, you have now completed your sabbatical year after finishing important work assignments for the National Institutes of Health and the University of Leiden. What were your thoughts as you prepared to leave Chapel Hill for Yale University? HC: Fran, my three children were dismayed to leave Chapel Hill, which was the only home they had known and which contained most of their friends. Blanche was upset, too, but was too busy making plans to move on to spend much time on unhappy reflections. I was deeply hurt by the fact that President Friday and newly appointed Chancellor Sitterson made no proposal that might have extended my stay at UNC. I was mystified, too, that they simply ignored the fact that I had &quot;permanent tenure&quot; at UNC (NB - Letter of March 7, 1956 from Chancellor House). However, like Blanche, I was so busy banking the fires in Chapel Hill and preparing to move to New Haven that I really didn&#x27;t have time to be unhappy. Besides, I was age 48 at that CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 211 time, had the prospect of a lot more good work years ahead, had just completed two highly successful work assignments and was looking forward to another challenging job in Connecticut. FW: Henry, I have several questions I would like to ask as we close our discussion of your work during 1950-65 as Administrator of the Division of Health Affairs at UNC. HC: O.K. Go ahead. FW: First, in your view, what were your main accomplishments during your 15 years in that office? HC: Fran, I feel our recent interviews present these in some detail. However, perhaps I can summarize all this in these terms: A. I oversaw and coordinated the activation of a major medical center at UNC during 1950-56, which almost doubled the size of UNC-CH as it existed in 1950. Then, when national legislation challenged all U.S. University Medical Centers to expand their programs I conceptualized and implemented a plan of action during 1957-65 which doubled the size and scope of Health Affairs programs from the levels they had reached in 1956. Much of the credit for this monumental second phase development has been claimed by the School of Medicine. The truth is that, though the Medical Dean and his faculty did make major contributions, there were huge contributions by the UNC Planning Office, by other schools in Health Affairs, by my office staff, by senior officers in the University, by State Government officials and others which the Dean of Medicine failed to acknowledge. But as Mac Norwood has stated in a letter to Paul Sharp, I had conceptualized the whole approach to the second stage development and oversaw the process to a successful conclusion. B. Beyond my main focus in Health Affairs, I was also active in the following ways: I served as the chief liaison agent and spokesman for Health Affairs with the Main Campus as a member of many key UNC faculty and administrative committees and boards. C. I was deeply involved on the national health scene through special assignments for a variety of prominent organizations, including the American Hospital Association, the Rockefeller Foundation the U.S. Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health, the Association of Academic Health Centers, the Society of Medical Administrators and more. Also, as a private consultant I made contributions to many other universities and governmental and voluntary health agencies. D. I took leadership roles in Chapel Hill and beyond in a large number of community service projects, in church affairs and in sports activities. In many of the activities I have identified, my performance in a given function led to requests to take on new and expanded functions. This, in turn, brought increasing recognition from professional colleagues around the country and, with that recognition, requests for consultation help and/or job offers. Much of this has been discussed during our interviews. There is also a great deal of material, including many personal letters, which bear on all this in my library papers. An editorial in a late September 1966 issue of The Chanel Hill Newsnaper is especially relevant in this regard. FW: That answers one question - but I have another. In retrospect, are there steps that you wish you had taken in Chapel Hill but did not? HC: A wise man once said &quot;The saddest words in all the world are &#x27;what might have been&#x27; .&quot; I could write a book on that theme from my total experience in Chapel Hill. Yes, there are additional steps I wish I had taken during the developmental years of Health Affairs. Let me mention just three or four: CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 212 First, I wish I had insisted on an expanded staff for my office during the first six years. But there was no money available for a long time and the Chancellor and President were not very sensitive to my need in this regard. And, in addition, I couldn&#x27;t find the one or two people who really seemed to fit the need. So I compensated by adopting 12-14 hour work days myself. Second, I wish I had developed a regular &quot;in-house&quot; newsletter for Health Affairs which could have been given a broad state-wide distribution. That would have told our developing story to a wide audience and built up understanding and support for the leadership of my office. But I had no money or staff for this and the overall University program in the public relations field was very small in the 1950s. Third, I wish I could have developed a core group of faculty supporters who were not bound by tradition but who might have become something of a &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; to dream dreams with me and provide support for their implementation. Fourth, one of the first topics I would have explored with such a group would have been the concept of establishing a free-standing Institute of Medical Care within Health Affairs, drawing, in part, on the examples of the Institute of Government and the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences at UNC. An Institute of Medical Care could have been the instrument to address the implementation of the Sanger Report. But it would have required a substantial core staff and a lot of money for its activation - and much more of each as time went by. However, I first needed to expand my own office staff to have the time to work on such a large and innovative developmental issue. Fran, I could say lots more. However, perhaps I should remind you once more that I came to Chapel Hill in 1950 at age 32 to serve as one of the first &quot;Vice Chancellors for Health Affairs&quot; in the USA. There was no job description and no role model for the position and the University Administration at that point was not at all prepared to oversee the huge expansion which lay immediately ahead. I had to start from a very modest base. FW: I think that is a fair comment. But I have another question: what was the real problem in your relationship with Reece Berryhill? HC: Well, first, there were conceptual differences. Reece was a strong conservative. In this respect, among other things, he was a sharp critic of Frank Graham; he had problems with the admission of Jewish and Black students to the School of Medicine and the opening up of the State Medical Society to Black members; and I have been told he was strongly conservative in his Church functioning. On the other hand, I have been a liberal all my life and, though I have never &quot;marched,&quot; I have certainly worked for equal opportunity and fair play. Second, Recce&#x27;s obsession during my years in Chapel Hill was to develop his School of Medicine as a classic teaching and research institute. His models seemed to be Harvard and Western Reserve, where he obtained his training during the 1920s and early 1930s. Furthermore, the starting point in his thinking about any issue was &quot;What is in the best interest of the School of Medicine and its faculty?&quot; His belief in the primacy of Medicine and the physician often appeared to me as complete arrogance. He had a contempt for the other schools of the health professions in Chapel Hill which alienated each one, but he persisted in his own convictions and worked actively to dissolve the Division of Health Affairs and get rid of me as his administrative superior officer. The starting point in my thinking was &quot;How can Health Affairs and especially the School of Medicine best meet the health needs of the people of North Carolina - and beyond?&quot; I felt the physician is, and should function as, the captain of the health team. But a true captain should help build and promote the development of the team. It was evident in the 1950s that the CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 213 expanding body of knowledge in the health field was leading to increasing specialization and it seemed clear that, in the future, auxiliary health workers were going to render more and more of the health care to patients. In this context I felt that Dentistry, Nursing, Public Health and Pharmacy, as well as Medicine, needed my strong support to reach their full potentials and I sought to promote understanding, mutual respect and team development throughout Health Affairs. These differences in points of view were important but were only background aspects of the real divisive problem between Berryhill and me. Reece demanded the complete loyalty of everyone around him and he could be a first class bully to any faculty or staff member who lost his favor. Since I had been a student in the two year school in 1937-39 when he was Assistant Dean, he thought when he helped recruit me to come to Chapel Hill that I would be his &quot;boy&quot; and his agent to do his will. He was shocked to learn that I was an independent thinker, not a captive; that I was committed to giving Dentistry, Nursing, Public Health, Pharmacy and the Allied Health Professions (as well as Medicine!) an opportunity for their full development; that I was convinced that his School of Medicine could become a &quot;service facility for the whole state&quot; (the Sanger Report) to the benefit, rather than the weakening of its traditional teaching and research functions; and that I would not be swayed by his bullying tactics. He often contended to the Chancellor, the President and selected Trustees, as well as to his faculty and selected alumni, that I was &quot;holding his school back,&quot; though no specifics were ever put forth and there was no truth in the contention. FW: I have still another question, Henry. Why did Paul Sharp - and more important, Carlyle Sitterson and Bill Friday - want you to leave Chapel Hill without respecting your permanent tenure? HC: Fran, I really don&#x27;t know. I expect Sharp and Sitterson were comfortable with the traditional concept that the proper role of a School of Medicine was as a teaching and research institute, and they did not feel that our School of Medicine should be heavily involved in fulfilling Sanger&#x27;s &quot;statewide service concept.&quot; I think it is quite possible that neither Sharp nor Sitterson was fully aware of the history of the Good Health Movement of the 1940s and the fact that Graham, Carmichael, Berryhill and other UNC spokesmen had used the rationale of the Sanger Report as leverage to get State Legislative approval for expanding our Medical School. I think both Sharp and Sitterson may have been sympathetic to Berryhill&#x27;s and, in turn Ike Taylor&#x27;s, emphasis on the primacy of Medicine in the Health Affairs constellation, and to accept to some degree the two Deans&#x27; contention that I was &quot;holding the School of Medicine back&quot; despite the absence of any specifics. All that is speculation. I really think the main problem was that Bill Friday got tired, after many years, of hearing negative things about me from Berryhill and other spokesmen for the Medical School, including some Trustees. He knew all the positive and negative factors I have been describing about Berryhill (and to some degree, Ike Taylor). But he simply didn&#x27;t want to &quot;take on&quot; the Berryhill-Taylor clique, particularly in the light of the ugly experience he had had with the Trustees in 1956, because he knew he would have to face some Trustees again if he did. Sharp had made a change in the administrative organization of the Chancellor&#x27;s office which eliminated my position in the University. Friday was content with my removal from office, hoping perhaps, like Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s yielding to Hitler at Munich, to &quot;guarantee peace&quot; for an extended period in the Health Affairs sphere. I had several conferences with Friday and Sitterson during the spring and summer before the Clarks left for New Haven. They were polite conversations but without any warmth. I was CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 214 given little recognition in those conversations for my 15 years of service to the University. On the other hand, there was no criticism of my performance. They offered no work option for me at UNC despite my &quot;permanent tenure.&quot; I did not press that point because I simply did not want to stay where I was not wanted and would not be supported. Sitterson did volunteer to extend my leave of absence to Sept. 30,1966 with half pay. As I have previously stated, I submitted my resignation to UNC on July 20, 1966 to take effect on October 1, 1966. I had accepted a proposal to go to Yale University as Director of the Connecticut Regional Medical Program with parallel professorial appointments in both the Yale and University of Connecticut Schools of Medicine. I had chosen the Yale proposal over a similar proposal from Johns Hopkins University. I had also given serious consideration to a third proposal. Howard Holderness, the President of the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Co., urged me to accept the Directorship of the Life Insurance Medical Research Foundation, which was funded by a consortium of leading life insurance companies across the USA. I conferred with the presidents of the Connecticut General and Equitable Life Insurance Companies at some length and was told I could move the offices of the Foundation to Chapel Hill if I wished. However, the appointment at Yale seemed more in keeping with my professional interests and, besides, for me living in Chapel Hill had temporarily lost its charm. FW: Henry, one final question. Were there any developments following your departure from UNC which tended to support the validity of your judgments which were not accepted? HC: Yes, I think there were several. For example: First, Paul Sharp resigned as Chancellor in January 1966 after only sixteen months in office. The newspaper editorials were not very complimentary, including one entitled &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow.&quot; I understand the routine functioning of Health Affairs during the months after I began my sabbatical, with inexperienced people in charge, was somewhat chaotic. Perhaps Sharp began to realize he had made a mistake in my case. Shortly after succeeding Paul Sharp as Chancellor, Carlyle Sitterson reinstated the position I had held, with a new title of &quot;Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences.&quot; Vice Chancellor should have been the title from the beginning. By 1966 almost every university in the USA with a medical center had a Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs. Obviously Sitterson thought Sharp had made a mistake, as I certainly did, in eliminating my position. Second, during the 1964-68 period the Hospital was served by three Hospital Directors. Some operating problems developed. In 1968 a visit by an accreditation team from the Joint Commission on Hospitals noted some serious deficiencies and reduced the accreditation to provisional approval for one year. Chancellor Sitterson brought in an experienced consulting team which made a series of cogent recommendations, one of which was to transfer the Hospital back to the jurisdiction of the Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences from the jurisdiction of the Dean of Medicine. This was done in 1969, and, as another step, a separate Board of Trustees was created by legislative act in 1971. The prediction I made in 1956 that the transfer of the hospital to the jurisdiction of the Medical Dean would eventually lead to operating problems in the hospital were fulfilled during the 1964-68 period. Fran, you will recall I was strongly opposed to the original transfer. Third, During the 1965-75 decade Chancellor Leo Jenkins at East Carolina University waged an all-out campaign to obtain legislative approval for a School of Medicine at his school. He was ultimately successful in this effort over the stronq opposition of President Friday and the UNC Board Trustees. One persuasive argument by Jenkins was that the UNC-CH School of CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 215 Medicine had not responded significantly to the state-wide service concept contained in the 1947-49 legislative authorization for that school. Jenkins promised to do better in that regard. You will, of course, recall, that for 15 years I had strongly urged the Medical Dean and the Chancellor and President be more responsive to our legislative mandate in this regard. Fourth, as I have also pointed out in our earlier discussion, though my views on medical regionalization were not accepted and applied at UNC-CH, they were highly respected in Washington with the result that I spent seven months of my sabbatical leave from Chapel Hill as a special advisor to Dr. James Shannon, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, on the implementation of the Regional Medical Programs legislation on a nation-wide basis. And on Oct. 1, 1966,1 was to go to Yale university, where the top medical leadership at Yale (and also at UConn) was much more committed than that at UNC to develop an outstanding Regional Medical Program for its state. This, indeed, came to pass, as we shall see. Fifth, finally, Fran, in the weeks immediately preceding and following my departure from Chapel Hill in late September, 1966,1 received a number of letters from UNC Trustees, senior administrators, faculty members and friends who were quite familiar with the politics, the personalities and the problems - also the size of the job I had faced in Chapel Hill during 1950-65 - and were, overall, very complimentary and supportive of the job I had done. I feel anyone making a fresh assessment of that job should search out those letters in my personal papers and especially those written by Mac Norwood, Coriden Spruill, Chancellor R.B. House, Claude Teague, Fred Weaver, Watts Hill, Ed McGavran, John Brauer and, in 1972, Ike Taylor. In this connection I think a brief extract from a letter of Sept. 13, 1966 from Watts Hill is appropriate at this point. Watts was reporting on a Sept. 9, 1966 meeting of the UNC Trustees Executive Committee where he had made a motion to accept my resignation; also to send me a resolution of appreciation for my 15 years of service at UNC. He wrote further: &quot;I stated in open meeting that you had been treated shabbily by Chancellor Sharp and others on the campus. I did not identify the &quot;others,&quot; but the Chapel Hill administrators knew exactly of whom I spoke. I said ... we at Chapel Hill would eventually realize that you had made a great contribution to the University and that some day people would understand the real value of your dreams which you had done your best to implement. I commented that you were able to see into the future of the Medical Center far better than anyone connected with the University.....&quot; Sometime later I received a letter of commendation from Archie Allen, the Secretary of the UNC Board of Trustees. FW: Henry, you have provided good answers to my questions. I think it is time now to move on from your years in Chapel Hill to your years in Connecticut. I understand you feel your role in activating the Connecticut Regional Medical Program was the high spot of your professional career. I am very anxious to hear that story!</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>This is the first of two interviews with African American photojournalist Alexander M. Rivera. Rivera was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1913. His family settled there after fleeing Wilmington following the race riot of 1898. Rivera recalls his father&#x27;s involvement in the NAACP during the 1920s and 1930s and the influence of his progressive racial views. Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Rivera became a student at Howard University in the early 1930s but had to leave school to work during the Great Depression. It was during these years that Rivera first began to work as a photojournalist in Washington, D.C. His coverage of Marian Anderson&#x27;s concert at the Lincoln Memorial was the first major event he covered. In the late 1930s, Rivera returned to North Carolina and finished his education at North Carolina Central College. During World War II, Rivera worked for Naval Intelligence in Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly thereafter, he began to work for the Pittsburgh Courier, covering events in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. As a photojournalist for the Courier, Rivera covered such events as the Willie Earle lynching in South Carolina, the Isaiah Nixon lynching in Georgia, and the school desegregation cases of the 1950s. In recalling these events, Rivera illuminates the nature of race relations and racial violence that characterized Jim Crow segregation; the impact of the Brown v. Board of Education decision and the role of key players, such as Thurgood Marshall; and the changing social landscape. Finally, he recalls his travels to Africa with Richard Nixon in 1957.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: What I&#x27;ve done I&#x27;ve done and if it&#x27;s worth anything, that&#x27;s it. But I don&#x27;t plan on writing anything.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Well, this might be a poor substitute for a book but maybe necessary.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, if I had known that I was doing, what I was doing was important, I would&#x27;ve kept some better notes about what I was doing. But at the time I was a young reporter, and I was just enjoying what I was doing day by day. When night came, I did what most reporters at that time were doing, looking for a bar somewhere. So the day was over and I waited for the next day. But it wasn&#x27;t until I covered the Marian Anderson story in Washington that I realized that I might be onto something important. Other than that it was just a daily routine.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I was wondering, maybe if we could go back to the beginning and just start out—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Go anywhere you want to go.  KIERAN TAYLOR: For the sake of the tape recording, if you could just say your name and when and where you were born.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: My name is Alexander Rivera, born in Greensboro, North Carolina, and this was October the 4th, 1913. Very few people think that I&#x27;m as old as I am. My father was a dentist. So we realized that with his position and income we had a really good life by comparison. In those days in 1913 we had steam heat in the house and a car, a telephone. A lot of people didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just saying that to give you background to the kind of life I had.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Right.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: My father would be considered now a radical because and I never knew what his interest was until later in life. He at fourteen years of age was, he and his family were run out of Wilmington, North Carolina, during the Wilmington Riot.  KIERAN TAYLOR: In 1896? [1898]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah, and that affected him. Of course it affected his father too because his father was a very prominent undertaker. When he was run out of Wilmington in the Wilmington Riot of 1898, he never got over it. I mean his father never got over it and I&#x27;m sure he didn&#x27;t either because he became very race conscious. He was a representative of the NAACP in Greensboro. I say that to say that I met as a boy a little child I met all of the NAACP representatives Walter White and William Pickens and James Weldon Johnson and all those people because to belong to the NAACP was almost a sure loss of a job. With him being professional he didn&#x27;t have any job to lose. So he didn&#x27;t worry about it. The people that came to Greensboro could not find places to stay because they didn&#x27;t have any hotels that would accommodate them. So they all stayed at our house. It was just known that when they came to Greensboro that they were going to stay. This was my background as a child.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So your grandfather was an undertaker in Wilmington?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Great grandfather too.  KIERAN TAYLOR: And your great grandfather in Wilmington.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Great grandfather and grandfather. But my grandfather was Thomas A. Rivera, and his family were run out of Wilmington. My great grandfather was not. He was too old. They did not think he was any problem. So they didn&#x27;t bother him. My grandfather was at the riot was given just overnight time to leave. Of course with that kind of experience, they never got over it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Did you know your grandfather?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh yes.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay. So when you were growing up you would&#x27;ve talked to him.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I didn&#x27;t. When I was coming up, I didn&#x27;t know about the riot. My father didn&#x27;t make any about the riot. So we didn&#x27;t discuss it. It wasn&#x27;t until Helen Edmonds was doing a book called Fusion Politics in North Carolina that she came around to interview my grandfather. I was in college at the time. Then I realized that he had something important to say, but it was too late. I had, she interviewed him, and I have the book somewhere around here. But instead of sitting down and talking to him about it and all because he was very talkative. He would&#x27;ve talked about it. My great grandfather would not talk about it at all because he jumped ship, and that&#x27;s the reason why he was in this country illegally.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Is that right?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Cut it off.  [Recorder is turned off and then back on.]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: My great grandfather would not ever talk about it. He wouldn&#x27;t talk about it. He was always afraid that somebody would come and send him back.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now you say he jumped ship.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah he was on, I guess he was a sailor because as I say he wouldn&#x27;t talk about it. So I didn&#x27;t know to ask him because I didn&#x27;t know him, my great grandfather. I knew my grandfather. He had jumped ship that was—. Wilmington was an outstanding port, and he came in from Cuba, and when the boat docked, he decided he wasn&#x27;t going back. He decided to stay here. With what he had on he just stopped. See in those days, undertakers were cabinet makers because they made their, did a lot of work on the caskets. Caskets are wooden and they, so he had some knowledge and some skills in that regard. He became an undertaker.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Do you have any idea about when that would&#x27;ve been that he settled in Wilmington?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Cut it off there. He, let me see. [interruption] I think it might be in here. It might be in here.  That&#x27;s the church that they, where they did all the planning. [refers to picture of the church in Clarendon County South Carolina where civil rights organizing occurred]  KIERAN TAYLOR: Liberty Hill.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: These are the fighters—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Oh okay.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The freedom fighters I was talking about. It was some mess. Oh oh oh oh.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Let me put it off. [interruption] That would&#x27;ve been.   ALEXANDER RIVERA: They came—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Was your father born in Greensboro?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, he was born in—  KIERAN TAYLOR: So he was born—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: In Wilmington.  KIERAN TAYLOR: In Wilmington.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah, where the family was.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now how about and your grandfather was born in Wilmington.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: It was the great grandfather that—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I have an article in the Long Leaf Pine. That was a state— [interruption] I don&#x27;t want to give you that. I&#x27;m not  sure. When I was telling you about that, I just ran across this when I was telling you that—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Would you have grown up with anything that you could identify as Cuban traditions? Does anything remain in the family over the generations?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. This is my father was Dr. A. M. Rivera. They&#x27;ll have a picture of him in here, but he led this fight to defeat Judge John J. Parker in 1930. That was the first national NAACP. I was telling you before that they all came to my house and so forth. He lead the first national victory that they had in 1930. There was, the field judge, Judge John J. Parker was as you see was led by my father. My father felt that he was a racist. He fought it, and they won the case. Parker never got to be a Supreme Court justice. They have always given my father credit for defeating him. Of course he had everybody on his side I think besides the NAACP. My father was behind that. So that was something that you could see.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I guess I was trying to give you a background and that got us all into this hassle. He never prodded me to do it, and as far as I know my grandfather and father never encouraged him to be an activist, but it got to him being expelled from the city because of the riots at fourteen years of age. It got to him, and you could see the things that he got into up until his death.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now where would you father have studied for his dentistry after—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Howard.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So he went to Howard.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Howard University. Graduated in 1909.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Then when you got ready to go to college—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I was naturally going to Howard.  KIERAN TAYLOR: You were going to Howard.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: That&#x27;s his alma mater. The girls went to Fisk and the boys went to Howard. It was during the Depression. So my second year there he lost his property and stuff. He said, ‘Well he said I&#x27;m going to have to keep the girls in school. I&#x27;ve got to protect them. So you&#x27;ll have to get a job.’ So I got a job in Washington.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Do you remember going up to Washington, was that a big change for you just being so far from home?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: It was a delight because I had a very strict father. Getting that far away from him was really ideal because when I got to that Fourteenth Street Bridge, I was like Martin Luther King. I said free at last. I was—he always, he felt that the idle, they had an expression about idleness is the devil&#x27;s workshop. He always saw to it that I had a list of things to do. A list when I got home from school, I had a list there. Things that I was to do. So when I graduated and was going to Howard I said, ‘Well I&#x27;m free at last.’  KIERAN TAYLOR: Then you were telling me, so you got work. You were basically forced to take a job. Right because of the Depression.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: As a means of survival. [Phone ringing] He wrote me a letter and told me that he had to take care of my  sisters. I had to look for a job. So I had already done two years at Howard. What got me started me in photography and writing was the freshmen as a freshman I was a freshman reporter for the Bison which was the yearbook at Howard. The yearbook was published by the Washington Tribune, which was a local weekly. The paper also had printing department. So the newspaper printed the yearbook. I used to have to bring my reports and clips into the paper to the yearbook section, the printing division. They saw it and wondered if I wanted a job. Well, I need one right then. So I said yes I want a job. So I took a job with the Washington Tribune as a reporter. That wasn&#x27;t enough. I got a second job. William B. Umstead was our congressman here. I got another job through him as a messenger for the Treasury department. So with those two jobs I was able to make it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Would you remember what kind of stories you covered in the beginning? What sort of assignments would they give you?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Police. See when you start out you get very, because I didn&#x27;t know reporting.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Right.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The police department was two doors from our building. I was assigned to cover the police report.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So the DC police beat, huh?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well just the black part of it. So I would go in, and I would read the register who was arrested and for what and so forth and so on. If it was a big enough story, we would enlarge it. Otherwise we would just do a rundown of it. But that&#x27;s how we got started. Then I got to work with Sam Lacy who is in his nineties now and is still living. He is with The Afro-American Newspaper and still working. But I got with him, and fortunately he liked the horses. He liked to go to the racetrack. So some of his assignments he would get me to do them while he went to the racetrack. So when I would, like a high school football game, I&#x27;d cover it. He&#x27;d come in, and I&#x27;d give it to him, and he&#x27;d go over it, and then I would see whatever corrections he&#x27;d made and how he had spruced it up and what spin he&#x27;d put on it and so forth. So I learned by working with him a lot.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So he was at the Tribune at that time.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah he was at that time. He is with The Afro-American now. Tribune I think is out of business as a paper it&#x27;s out of business.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. It&#x27;s out of business all together.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah. No, at what point, about how long, I know you had covered one of the early stories was the Marian Anderson story.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: That wasn&#x27;t until 1938-39.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay, so that was significantly later.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I was about ready to leave Washington and come down here and go to school. It was a big story. I was assigned to cover it because first of all I could write and also take pictures. I was one of the early photojournalists, black in the country. There weren&#x27;t very many. Most of the fellows would either write or take pictures. See you have to understand the development of photography had not produced the thirty-five millimeters for us around here. We were still using the () and C() cameras. It was just a big box. So it was cumbersome. You had to carry it around and so forth. That&#x27;s what I was using. I was using the (). As time went on of course the cameras got smaller and more diverse and easier to handle, more versatile. But so they had asked me to go to Baltimore get on the train. Of course the train came, Marian Anderson was coming from New York. We knew that. I was to get on the train in Baltimore and interview her. So I would have the first interview coming into Washington. I would already have it. So I went to Baltimore and got on. So I asked one of the conductors was Miss Marian Anderson on this train. He said—train coming from New York. He said, ‘Yes.’ So I jumped on the train and the train started out from Washington. I found out she wasn&#x27;t even on the train. My first big assignment I was about to blow it. In fact I figured I had already blown it. But the trains were very close, and another train was coming in from New York, was very close. So when I got to the train station in Washington, I just stayed there. When she got off the train, I asked her a few quick questions and took a picture of her. I covered myself very well. Then she had a rehearsal at the Lincoln Memorial. She had a rehearsal that afternoon, that morning for the afternoon concert. So I found out about the rehearsal. The trip wasn&#x27;t altogether lost. I went to the Washington Memorial to the rehearsal with her. There I met Tom Macavoy. Tom Macavoy was a Life reporter. So we got a chance to chat.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now by the time you interviewed her at the Washington station had the controversy already taken place?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh, the controversy ran almost, it ran for months. This was a solution. She was coming to sing at the Lincoln Memorial. This was a solution that was brought about by Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and [Harold] Ickes who was secretary. So they decided that she couldn&#x27;t sing at Constitution Hall, she&#x27;d sing at the—  KIERAN TAYLOR: The memorial  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The memorial. That&#x27;s the same memorial that King, in front of which King spoke. Oh yeah it had run for months and months. Of course in the first place you see she was a nationally known singer, and Howard University was promoting her. They didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d have a problem. The only place really large enough to house the concert was the DAR.  KIERAN TAYLOR: The DAR, yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: So Mrs. Roosevelt being a member. She got upset when they decided that they couldn&#x27;t have them, and she withdrew her membership. She wrote a column called, ‘My Day’. In her column she denounced it there, and a lot of her friends who were also members of the DAR pulled out. But the actual concert in front of the Lincoln Memorial was the solution I think. It had been running hot and heavy for months. Ever since the DAR said no, it ran immediately papers and all.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So you attended the actual concert as well.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Were you taking photographs at the concert?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Wow.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I&#x27;ve got a picture that&#x27;s run all over and everything, famous picture of her singing. Isn&#x27;t any need for me to go back down here because I&#x27;ve got it. I don&#x27;t know exactly where it is.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That&#x27;s all right. And you said that was about the time—I wanted to ask you. How did you get into photography? Did you know photography, did you learn photography in Greensboro?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No.  KIERAN TAYLOR: It was just as a student and as a reporter that you picked it up.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. To have something to do with—they didn&#x27;t run it. They didn&#x27;t run that picture. To have something—  KIERAN TAYLOR: I didn&#x27;t see it in there.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: To have something to do with the yearbook. That was my way of getting into the yearbook. Because I didn&#x27;t get my first photography, my first camera until I got to the newspaper. I was just using a little camera, what you called a Kodak  KIERAN TAYLOR: So you said that the Marian Anderson story took place just as you were about to leave Washington. What happened, why did you leave Washington?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, my father was—see I was a dropout. Him being a dentist. I&#x27;m sure he wanted me to be a dentist. I&#x27;m sure that he expressed that he wanted me to take his practice over.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So he wanted you to study for the dentistry.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, for me to stop school that second year of college was calamitous to him. But I was enjoying it. I was a reporter, and he could tell that I wasn&#x27;t going to do anything. I was satisfied with myself. I was having fun and also able to support myself. That&#x27;s all I could—but he had a friend here who was president of the North Carolina College. He was his dentist and good friend. He used to go all the way from here to Greensboro to have his dental work done, which was like an all day trip in those days. So my father and Dr. Shepard got together—  KIERAN TAYLOR: This is Doctor James—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: James E. Shepard president of North Carolina College. They got together. I didn&#x27;t know this. They got together and conspired to get me back into school. So Dr. Shepard offered me a scholarship if I would organize a news bureau for the college. So I was quite excited about the whole thing. I left Washington, came to Durham to organize this department and also to continue my schooling. That&#x27;s where I got back in college and that&#x27;s where I, I did organize the department and got back in school.  KIERAN TAYLOR: When did you figure out that they had been conspiring?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, early because when I first started to write for the school, Dr. Shepard came to me and says, ‘Now before you send anything to the paper, I want you to send it to the English department.’ I said, ‘Oh no.’ I said, ‘This won&#x27;t work.’ I said, ‘Oh no. This won&#x27;t work.’ So I&#x27;m going back. I said, ‘Shit, I&#x27;m going back to Washington. I think I can still get my job back.’ So he knew then that his part of the bargain would&#x27;ve fallen through. He said, ‘Well just try it. Let&#x27;s just try it.’ I knew then that it was something fishy. So I tried it. He was happy, and I was quite successful with the—I have in this pile of junk down here somewhere. I&#x27;ve got a recommendation from him to the local paper recommending me for a job without any reservations. I&#x27;ve just got that to put it in my file and never did use it. But until the day he died Dr. Shepard was very, very happy about the fact that I—he never did have a son. He always said that if he had a son, he wished he&#x27;d be like me. But I was very frank with him, and even at my age that was unusual because people on the faculty were afraid of losing their job if they were frank. I was never afraid because I knew him as a, he was like an uncle to me. I knew him as a tot. So he would ask me, he says, ‘You know I ask you because they won&#x27;t tell me the truth.’ They being the faculty. He said, ‘They fish around to find out what I want to know and then they give it to me. That&#x27;s no good. That&#x27;s no good. You&#x27;re going to tell me just like it is.’  KIERAN TAYLOR: Like it is.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: How you think it is anyway. I said, ‘Yes, that&#x27;s the only way I know to do.’ So that&#x27;s how I got back in school. I graduated in &#x27;41, started college in &#x27;31 and graduated in &#x27;41, ten years. I wasn&#x27;t in school (). I had lost that much time. I hadn&#x27;t lost that much time but I was out of school that much time.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Upon graduation what did you do next?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I went to work for the school.  KIERAN TAYLOR: You were still working with the school right.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I still worked for the school. One day the executives of the Pittsburgh Courier came to town. They wanted to see me because see in the work that I was there for the school I was sending material, pictures and stories, to all the black newspapers, southern white newspapers, all of them. So they knew of my work. So these executives of the Pittsburgh Courier came to town and said, ‘We want to meet Rivera.’ So Dr. Shepard sent for me. I went into his office, and they were all in there. He says, ‘Now I want you to know that I&#x27;ve got the best reporter in the country.’ When they left the office and went back to the hotel, they sent for me and asked me how would I like to have a job.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now would this have been Mr. Vann or his assistant?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: His wife. Mrs. Vann. Vann was dead but she was running the paper.  KIERAN TAYLOR: She did. Okay.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Mrs. Vann. Yeah. So I said, ‘Sure I&#x27;d like to’—of course there was a nice salary and all. I said sure. Shepard was mad as he could be. Ohh. Mad at them for taking me. They told him you should never advertise something you don&#x27;t want to sell. They told him, Dr. Shepard said, ‘If I had known it, you never would have seen him.’ That&#x27;s how I got with the Courier. I worked with the Courier covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So what year would you have started then with the Courier? It&#x27;s before the war right?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. In the war I was in naval intelligence. I was at Norfolk, worked out of Norfolk. This was &#x27;45-46.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay so this was after. So shortly after you graduated then you went into Naval intelligence.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The war was on. I went, shortly after I left here Dr. Shepard and I were always fussing and fighting about something. I fell out with him about something. I don&#x27;t know what it was. It may be inconsequential but—. The Norfolk Journal Guide newspaper heard that we were having difficulty. So they offered me a job. So I was in Norfolk. This was during the war 19—see I graduated in &#x27;41. Early I went to work for The Journal Guide newspaper in Norfolk. It wasn&#x27;t any time before the Navy interviewed me for a job with Naval Intelligence. So I worked with them until the war was over.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What kind of work did you do for Naval intelligence? Was it journalism?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. Intelligence. See I had a, I was a commander class. It was captain, captain class, but I was arrested one day and carried to the police station. In the back of the police station were these Navy officers. As soon as I walked in one of them says, shook his head and said, ‘No, no, no. He won&#x27;t do. He won&#x27;t do.’ I said, ‘Now just a minute.’ I said, ‘This is—I&#x27;ve been arrested here and brought up by the police department. Now you said I won&#x27;t do. I won&#x27;t do for what. Was is this about?’ So they explained to me that they were looking for a nondescript Negro that they wanted for Naval intelligence. To stay out of it, because I had already passed—. I was ready to go into the service, and I knew it was just a matter of days before I would go into most anything. So I said Naval intelligence. You&#x27;re talking about these clothes I&#x27;ve got on. I said, ‘They&#x27;re not tattooed on. These come off. All this comes off.’ I said, ‘I can be nondescript in ten minutes.’ The guy says, ‘Sit down there. Let&#x27;s talk about this.’ So we sat down and started talking and he found out that aside from being a reporter I had two years of law. I had taken two years of law in Washington at night while I was working. I was going to Terrell Law School. It&#x27;s a night law school there. The reason I went was not to be a lawyer because they were the poorest, black lawyers are the poorest people on earth. I was going, I was taking the law to understand court reporting. So I would go in court and all of sudden somebody will say something in Latin and everybody would (). I needed to take some law. So I took two years of law. So then they found out this, when told me, let&#x27;s sit down and let&#x27;s chat. They said, &#x27;Oh yeah. You&#x27;ve finished school. You have law. You&#x27;re not a lawyer, but you&#x27;ve gone to law school. Captain Gray spoke up. He said, ‘Well I&#x27;m not going to say yes or no today. I&#x27;m going to think about it a little bit.’ He said, ‘But I&#x27;ll call you.’ I said sure. I was rooming with a woman, in a rooming house there. She said to me, she says, ‘Now what have you done? What&#x27;s the police say?’ I said, ‘Not a thing.’ But I couldn&#x27;t tell her. I said, ‘Not a thing. I haven&#x27;t done a thing.’ She said, ‘You must have because the police came by and locked you up.’ I said, ‘Do you see I&#x27;m not locked up.’ She was there with her. She lived with daughters. I was the only man in the house. So she said, ‘Now I&#x27;m here by myself. If you&#x27;re doing something, you let me know now.’ I said, ‘No Miss Hudson. I&#x27;m not doing anything at all.’ So I said, ‘It was all a mistake. All a mistake.’ She said, ‘Well okay.’ I said—they came by looking for me and asked her if they knew me. So she looked at them she said, ‘I don&#x27;t know if I do or not. I don&#x27;t know if I do.’ She said, ‘You know my daughters take care of all my business.’ She looks at him hemming and hawing. She was saying that her mind wasn&#x27;t but so good. She was giving all kinds of reasons not to know me, give me a chance to move out. So then I went to work for the, in the Office of Naval Intelligence.  KIERAN TAYLOR: But that&#x27;s how they recruited is they went around and arrested people, took them in and did an interrogation.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well you see, across from the police office, police department there was a theatre, right across the street a theatre. The girl who took up tickets saw everybody who went in the police department. She saw them take me into the police department. By the time I got out of the police department it was all over town that I&#x27;d been arrested because she sat up there with a phone and she can call everybody in town and tell them I was arrested. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to tell anybody. They had some others in the Army, the G2. Their secret service was called G2. We were just called Naval intelligence. But we weren&#x27;t supposed to know each other, but we got a chance to know most of each other.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Did you ship out?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, I stayed in Norfolk.  KIERAN TAYLOR: You stayed in Norfolk.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: We went as far as Richmond, Virginia. I worked in Virginia.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What kind of work were you doing with intelligence?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Trying to find out if anybody was talking or saying anything. I got a job with a night club photographing sailors with the girls sitting all on their laps. They had the expression loose lips sink ships. I was finding out where they had a house of prostitution. I worked several houses of prostitution, several houses. It was our job to find out if they were any, if these sailors were talking because they didn&#x27;t know how much the girls would tell about ship movement.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Sure. Did you ever find any kind of incidents of spying or at least any incidents of sailors who were loose with the tongues—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, we were, we were like that but no specifics. We would get a general way they were talking too much. You see at the night club they were drinking whiskey. A girl sitting in your lap and they would say most anything. But most places were being watched and I didn&#x27;t have any—  KIERAN TAYLOR: But never any kind of German presence in the clubs or anything.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. No. So I was there until I left and came back to Durham to go to work at North Carolina College.  KIERAN TAYLOR: How long were you at the college again before—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The Courier.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah, before Courier came.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Wasn&#x27;t long, two years. About two years.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Two years.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Because Willie Earle, I can remember about the Willie Earle case. That was a lynching case. Willie Earle was in 1947. War was over in &#x27;45.  KIERAN TAYLOR: The Earle case was which one? Was that one in Georgia?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, it was South Carolina.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That was South Carolina.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: A man who was writing a book—wait a minute. Here it is. A man was writing a book wanted to use an interview that he had done of me. The school would not let him use any report or interview without my written—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Written permission.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Permission. So he wrote to me, and he sent all this stuff. I hadn&#x27;t even bothered to write it. I mean, to read it. It&#x27;s a whole bunch of stuff on the Willie Earle case.  KIERAN TAYLOR: On the Earle case. Is he just writing about the Earle case? Is that his focus?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Book, he&#x27;s writing a book on it. Willie Earle is a, he was a young black guy. This is a transcription of the—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Of your interview on the Earle case.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You want it?  KIERAN TAYLOR: I&#x27;d like to look at it. Maybe before I leave, I&#x27;ll take a look at it. That&#x27;d be great.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You can take all of it, bring it back.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay, phenomenal.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Willie Earle was a young black guy. He left South Carolina and went and lived in New York. He came back to South Carolina. As the story goes he made a proposal to some white girl. She reported it, and nothing really, nothing happened. He was locked up, but then they came to the prison. The person in charge of the prison to turn him over to the mob, and they were, they lynched him. The story and I think you&#x27;ll see it in there. The story is that none of it was true. It&#x27;s just some hotheads, and that was in &#x27;47 in Greenville.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Do you remember when you first went over to, when did you first hear about the lynching and—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The next day.  KIERAN TAYLOR: You heard about it the next day. And were you in Greenville the next day?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, I was here. But the paper said go immediately. So I went immediately. We got a chance to do some investigation. I went of course, we didn&#x27;t have any hotels. So I knew, I didn&#x27;t know. I knew a person who knew a lady there whose husband was an undertaker. This guy said, ‘Well now she got a big old house and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;s got some extra room.’ So she said now you go and I&#x27;ll tell them you&#x27;re coming. He didn&#x27;t tell her why I was coming. So I went and I stayed in a beautiful house, a big old house. The next morning she came, and she said, ‘I didn&#x27;t know you were involved in this case.’ She says, ‘I&#x27;m sorry.’ She said, ‘I&#x27;m really sorry but being involved in it, I&#x27;m by myself.’ And she said, ‘Anything could happen to me.’ So she had asked me to leave. So I didn&#x27;t know anybody else there. In fact I didn&#x27;t know her until I got there. So she referred me to this minister who also was president of the NAACP. So I went over and talked to him, and he said yeah you can stay in my house. He said take whatever fare I had and said fine. So I went over to his house and I stayed there. Most of the reporters, the black reporters who came to town also came there. So it was, that was headquarters for us. I went to see, I went to the courthouse to present my credentials—  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: So he slammed the door. I stood out there a long time waiting on him to come back. He came back in and says, ‘Judge Martin wants to see you.’ I went in. He says, ‘It&#x27;s going to be a tough case.’ He says, ‘I&#x27;m going for a conviction.’ There were thirty-two taxi cab drivers involved in it. He said, ‘I&#x27;m going for a conviction.’ He said, ‘South Carolina law requires that anybody being charged with a capital offense is eligible to have a kin sit with them.’ So instead of thirty-two it was sixty-four. So he says now, ‘I can&#x27;t give you, I can&#x27;t give you any kind of protection. You are walking around here with this camera around your neck, it looks like an expensive camera.’ He said, ‘These people have an idea that you can use it.’ I said, ‘I can.’ So he said, ‘It&#x27;s going to be a very dangerous place.’ He said, ‘I don&#x27;t want you sitting down on this lower level here. I want you to go back out—’ I said, ‘Oh no.’ I thought, ‘Oh Lord. I&#x27;m not going to be sitting down.’ He said, he said, ‘Really you would help me a lot if you would sit in the balcony.’ I said, ‘I don&#x27;t think I can hear it.’ He said, ‘I&#x27;ll see to it that you can hear everything.’ So if I did as much as that, he said, ‘Speak up.’ So I stayed up there until the trial was over. The FBI got into it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: They were down there huh?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh yeah, they had gotten into it. They had investigated it. So it was well investigated from the inception to the leaving the scene of the, the FBI had everything. They had who rode in each car and where they sat in each car and all that. One car had a flat tire. The people in that car had to get out and get in another car. They had the rearrangement. The FBI had everything. This foreman of the jury was from seminary down there. When the trial was over, the Courier told me to stay there and get some local reaction. They didn&#x27;t know anything about this trial. I&#x27;m leaving. So when the trial was over, I left. I got my reaction. I was in (). When they came back with the judgement, the jury said that that they had done what any red-blooded American would have done. So I said that&#x27;s the reaction. I&#x27;m well aware I&#x27;m in ().  KIERAN TAYLOR: Why was it the taxi drivers they had organized amongst themselves?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The girl, the girl was related to a taxicab driver.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Oh okay.  [Phone ringing]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I had a stroke. Last October, not this past but last. I had no paralysis except in my throat. For a long time I couldn&#x27;t swallow. The doctor didn&#x27;t think I was going to swallow again. But they were trying to figure out some kind of operation. I said, ‘Give it time. Give it time.’  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: It makes you tired. So I&#x27;m able to swallow better. I can eat most anything I want.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Great. You got it back. But it was the taxi drivers that—it was one of the, she was related to—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: It was one of them.  KIERAN TAYLOR: One of the drivers.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: All of the taxi cab drivers got involved with it. That&#x27;s what you call a lynching party there. The FBI, the FBI knew everything that went on. They&#x27;d interviewed them all. They had interviews from everybody. That didn&#x27;t make any difference.  KIERAN TAYLOR: No question about who did it or—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. No. They knew. They knew everybody and who did it. There was no question about it. For the foreman of the jury to have said that they did what anybody, what any red-blooded American would&#x27;ve done. That was it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So during the trial did you, you said you did your own investigating and you&#x27;re I&#x27;d imagine you were talking to people in the black community. What kind of reactions were you getting? Were people willing to talk to you first of all? I&#x27;d imagine there would be a lot of fear.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: There was a lot of tension in this town. First, when I first got there, I didn&#x27;t recognize the tension. I said to a guy a guy who came in later, Henning, Robert Henning later. I said black people talking about tension. I don&#x27;t feel it. He had covered the Scottsboro case. He had. He said there&#x27;s more tension in this trial than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. So then I got afraid because if it&#x27;s here and I don&#x27;t see it, then I&#x27;m subject to get hurt. Because I was moving around and asking everything. I remember going to ice cream parlor to get some ice cream. The guy who was working on the counter leaned over to pick up some ice cream and when he leaned up, I could see a pistol sticking out of his back pocket. I said Oh Lord. So the minister that I was staying with there, two incidents, first I was sitting up. It was hot weather. I was sitting up in the window with the window open and I was typing. He came in to me and he virtually tackled me. ���Are you crazy?’ I said, ���What do you mean?’ ‘You&#x27;re sitting right in front of that window. Anybody could shoot you. A sniper hit you. You wouldn&#x27;t even know anything about it.’ That frightened me. I pulled the blinds out and typing away from the window, stay away from the window. So we got ready to go to church, and he wanted all of us to go with him. I think he wanted to show off reporters (). So I said, ‘No, I&#x27;m not going.’ I said, ‘Look. I&#x27;m going to stay and rest in bed.’ So he said, ‘All right.’ He said, ‘I was hoping that you would go to church with me.’ So he packed his sermon in the briefcase and put a pistol in his pocket. I said, ‘Looky here. Wait a minute. Is that the only pistol in this house.’ He said, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Well you don&#x27;t need a pistol. You&#x27;re a man of God. I thought God would take care of you.’ ‘Yeah. I believe that.’ He said, ‘But there&#x27;s nothing in the Bible that says I can&#x27;t take care of myself until God gets here.’ So we all went to church and he preached. I never will forget it. He preached on the church to get a gun. Get a gun. He said, ‘() to town and go to Sears Roebuck and buy yourself a gun.’ He once had a pistol—  KIERAN TAYLOR: So he told them. Do you remember the minister&#x27;s name?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. It would be in … no, you could find it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Because he was head of the NAACP in Greenville.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Greenville, South Carolina. I mean the whole account is in the archives of both () and North Carolina Central in the library there the Courier archives. That was in 1947. It would be easy to find.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What are other big events that you covered in those days before Brown?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: The next one was a lynching in Georgia. Isaiah lynching.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Another lynching.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Then we went down to investigate that one. That was the one that I was sure that my luck had run out. Something happened that had never happened before in my whole life. Something told me, I don&#x27;t know what the something was to go dressed as a chauffeur. It was easier traveling as a chauffeur because everybody figured that you worked with somebody important. They didn&#x27;t want to have any problems. So I got to thinking. I&#x27;ve got a chauffeur&#x27;s cap. I kept it because it saved my life. I&#x27;m sure it saved my life. I had a little black bow tie on and a chauffeur&#x27;s cap. I went down to this place and I couldn&#x27;t find him. Couldn&#x27;t find where he lived because he lived in the country. He didn&#x27;t live in a little town. So I saw a guy sweeping, sweeping off his front there so I asked him, I said, ‘Let me ask you something.’ He was nervous. I said, I asked him, I said, ‘Did you know Isaiah Nixon?’ He starts sweeping real fast. He said, ‘Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew him. Yeah.’ I said, ‘You know where he lives?’ He said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘But you can&#x27;t get there in that car, in your car. Your car won&#x27;t go up there.’ I said, ‘What you mean?’ I had a Roadmaster vehicle. ‘What do you mean this car won&#x27;t go up there?’ He said, ‘It&#x27;s just a little trail.’ He said, ‘You won&#x27;t go up.’ I said, ‘Will your car go up there?’ He said, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Will you take me up there?’ He said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘Is it worth five dollars for you to take me up there?’ He thought a while, ‘Yeah.’ I had my camera stuff in my bag, travel bag and I had. We went up. I photographed the family and the kids and talked to, interviewed the wife and we left. (We got a ways) and I was going back to my car no incident at all. But in leaving we had to go circuitous in this turpentine district. So coming out we made a turn in this turpentine district and came face to face with a carload. I says, I was out of breath. I said, ‘Who are they?’ ‘I don&#x27;t know, but one of them&#x27;s the sheriff.’ I said, ‘One of them is the sheriff.’ That didn&#x27;t mean anything. So I said well, they just kept on and I said, ‘Well this might be it.’ So they told us to back up. Go on and back up to. Well, I hadn&#x27;t anticipated a problem. So I had, we didn&#x27;t have any escape plan or anything. I didn&#x27;t know what they would pick on us. When we got up to the house, stay in the car. They were going—he asked, they asked him who was I. They told, he told them that I was a relative of Nixon that came to see about the funeral, burial. I hadn&#x27;t been over there with her. So then they went in and I don&#x27;t know what she was going to say or anything. Then the only thing she would say truthfully was that I was a reporter from the Pittsburgh Courier. Well they came out and said you can go. I still don&#x27;t know whether it means that I, we can go until we get back down in those turpentine district with the trees and what not. We went all the way out to where my car was. Well I got to the car and I said, ‘Atlanta&#x27;s closer. It&#x27;s the closest big town. That&#x27;s what I wanted to get to.’ Atlanta was the closest big town. I&#x27;d have to go all the way through Georgia, South Carolina, until I got to North Carolina. I said, ‘I&#x27;d better go into Atlanta.’ So I struck out heading to Atlanta. When I got to Atlanta, I said, ‘Well who do I know in Atlanta?’ Bishop at my church was from Atlanta, Bishop Fountain. I&#x27;d seen him a long time. Of course when we had been at the church I&#x27;d take pictures (). I knew him well and he knew me.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Did you say Bishop T.F. Fountain?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Fountain. I don&#x27;t know the first name. I&#x27;ll let you see them later. So anyway when I got to the door, he said, he looked at me and he said, ‘Yes.’ I said Bishop Fountain. ‘Yes.’ Then it dawned. He said ‘Alex. What are you doing with that get up on?’ I had forgotten. I forgot I had the chauffeur cap on. I said ‘Bishop I need some whiskey.’ I need a drink of whiskey right bad. I told him that I had been covering a lynching. He sat down and got some whiskey and I sat down and told him the story. I got through that next day and left and then came on back to Durham. But it was touch and go.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That&#x27;s the one huh? Wow. Whereabouts in Georgia was this?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Montgomery County. It wasn&#x27;t in a city. I don&#x27;t know what the city would&#x27;ve been. Montgomery county. [Phone ringing] But that was the end of any real dangerous reporting. We had  another story, Buddy Bush in Jackson, North Carolina. He was arrested. They were going to do him in, but he was arrested and some people came to get him one night from jail. This was Jackson, North Carolina, put him in the car. He hit the handle, took off running into the bushes and what not. They never did get him. He ended up in Virginia, Suffolk, Virginia. He had been reading these cases I guess. So he said that he&#x27;d give himself up to me. I didn&#x27;t want him. They wanted him to give himself up. So he gave himself up to me. I drove up to Suffolk. On the outskirts of Suffolk was a little church, they were having a, on Sunday. They were having a meeting at this church. So I drove up. I didn&#x27;t know Buddy Bush. He said, ‘I want to be sure that there&#x27;s no harm comes to me.’ I said, ‘Well I want to be sure of that too.’ So I said, ‘We&#x27;ll find out.’ I asked about it. See the publicity keeps () nobody wants any publicity. So they had decided that no harm would come. He hadn&#x27;t done anything. He met, this is one Saturday on the street. He was going to the theatre and the white girl was going to the theatre. They said he said something to her and that was the way it was.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That was enough.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: That was enough. Uppity. Well I had another case Mack Ingram, Mack Ingram. You know about that case.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Umm huh.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Reckless eyeballing case. Over here in Yanceyville. Out from Yanceyville. They were on a farm. This girl was way out quite some distance. He was arrested for leering. I had to look the word up. It was an English word, an old English word leering. It means to stare. I didn&#x27;t know what it meant. I hadn&#x27;t heard leering.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Leering.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: What did he do to her? He was leering. Well what is that? I had to look it up. It means to stare and—  KIERAN TAYLOR: It sounds a lot worse when you don&#x27;t know what it is.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: At any rate he was convicted in two courts, and when the Courier sent me over, and by that time the national press had gotten into it. They decided that he wasn&#x27;t guilty of anything. But he was across a field. They gave the distance, and his lawyer had him to go to the back of the courtroom. It was a distance of probably about half of this () that this incident took place. He went to the back back there. He told Mack Ingram to, I want you to leer at the judge. Leer at him. Of course it was quite humorous. You couldn&#x27;t tell about him leering from that distance in the courtroom. It was thrown out of court.  KIERAN TAYLOR: During this period, the late &#x27;40s, early &#x27;50s did you have a sense that things were going to change? What was—no—because it seems like too much of what had already taken place.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well the law. The law had two, when you go to court. When you went to court, white people on this side, black people on this side in a court of law. If there was an interracial event, you didn&#x27;t have a chance. That&#x27;s what it was. That&#x27;s the reason why most blacks got a white lawyer because if they got a black lawyer when they came into court, they were in trouble.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Right.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: My wife.  KIERAN TAYLOR: But you had no sense that things were about to, that about to dramatically change.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Come here. [interruption] No I had no idea because it was the law. See this you had a lot  of people tell you, ‘I don&#x27;t like this and I&#x27;m against it, but it&#x27;s the law.’ So it was the law. Nothing changed until we got back to the Brown versus Topeka Board of Education. That changed everything because that changed the law. It was no longer the law. That changed but up until that time as long as we were, you were going to be lawful, segregation was the law of the land.  KIERAN TAYLOR: At what point did you learn about the folks in Clarendon County and what—did you know what they were up to from the beginning or was it only as that case became part of the larger Brown case that you became aware of that?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: See the first case, the first time the case came to court it came to court under a lawyer named Harold Boulware. Harold Boulware was a friend of mine. I knew him from the—we had all these, always had cases coming up, always cases. He had school cases and most cases were either school cases or transportation cases. So I said well here we have just another case. Sure enough the first case he lost it. Said it wasn&#x27;t lost on its merits. It was lost because it wasn&#x27;t brought in the right jurisdiction. So I said well, he didn&#x27;t even know what jurisdiction to bring the case in. Well it wasn&#x27;t that simple. But at that time they had already gotten, they were already persuaded that this was the right thing to do and continue. But he went to see NAACP. Harold Boulware took some cases from the NAACP. He stayed on the case because I was with him.  KIERAN TAYLOR: The one where they&#x27;re all on the hotel room there.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: They&#x27;re out on the bed.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: That wasn&#x27;t a hotel. It was a bed.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: This woman turned her house over to them and I had a name. Was looking for it for something. But anyway she turned the house over to them, and they did all their work right there in the house. I had it here. She no longer lives there. She moved anyway then. But I had it. I didn&#x27;t get it. But any rate that&#x27;s where they were.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Where they built their case.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Right there. They went to see Thurgood Marshall. Thurgood Marshall told them if they could get twenty defendants, the NAACP would take the case. But you see he wouldn&#x27;t take the case with one defendant and that person would get scared of getting killed and you wouldn&#x27;t have a case anymore. He didn&#x27;t expect they would get twelve defendants. I was almost sure he didn&#x27;t. But they got twenty some odd defendants. They were having meetings at that church, the (Liberty Hill) AME church and they raised money. The principal of the school had lost his job. The assistant had lost her job. They burned his house down, but those freedom fighters stuck right in it. When the case really got rough some people would pass Thurgood Marshall in the hall of the court and say you better not ever come back. You better not ever come back here. But of course see it was a case that had many, many twists. The judge himself, Julius Waring had had his experiences before this kind of case. He had had two or three. I know he had, one was a bus case during the war but a solider who had been harmed and I think he&#x27;d been killed. He lost that case and he got determined. The next case they had went after he became a federal judge was a law school case in South Carolina. I can&#x27;t think of the boy&#x27;s name there. But [John] Wrighten I think his name was Wrighten. But anyway he sued to go to the University of South Carolina. All of this you could check on, but he Judge Waring ruled in that case that South Carolina either had to admit him to the University of South Carolina, build another school or put a law school at the black school South Carolina State. The white people there said here was a native South Carolinian ruin like that. Then the other case was the Elmore case, George Elmore, I knew him when he sued to vote. He sued to vote. There&#x27;s George Elmore right there. Judge Waring ruled that they were eligible to vote, and he said anybody that did anything to circumvent his ruling would be in trouble, serious trouble. He said on the day of the voting, I&#x27;ll be in my office and I&#x27;m going to stay in my office until this voting is done. They voted. That was the first time they had voted in South Carolina since Reconstruction.  KIERAN TAYLOR: So Judge Waring had shown some indications that—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. Thurgood Marshall too had been in that case, but they&#x27;d been together before. They were together in that case. They were together. So they knew each other. Judge Waring knew about Clarendon County. He knew all about it. He knew the school conditions in Clarendon County. So he was well aware. This is the key thing. When they went, one day one morning the court started. He called Thurgood and told Thurgood, he says, ‘Come here. I want you to come into my chambers.’ So when he got to his chambers he stayed a few minutes. He went back out, and when he came back out, he was flabbergasted. You could tell that whatever Judge Waring told him was momentous. Thurgood wasn&#x27;t the kind of guy that would get upset by anything. He was always jovial and he was always in command. He was never very upset. His appearance upset everybody. So they got around him and found out, ‘What in the world did the judge tell you?’ Thurgood said, ‘The judge told me he said he didn&#x27;t want to hear another separate but equal case.’ He said, ‘Bring me a frontal attack on segregation.’ The judge told him. He said, ‘Well what did you tell the judge? Did you tell the judge we&#x27;re going to lose?’ ‘Yes.’ Said, &#x27;I told the judge we were sure to lose. We&#x27;re not going to lose in your court, but we&#x27;re going to lose on the appeal in the appellate court, the three-judge court we&#x27;re going to lose. He said the judge said, &#x27;Yes, you are. You&#x27;re going to lose in the three-judge court. You&#x27;ll get two votes against one in the three-judge court. Then you&#x27;re automatically in the Supreme Court, and he said, ‘That&#x27;s where you want to be.’ He said, ‘You&#x27;re automatically in the Supreme Court. That&#x27;s where you want to be.’ I don&#x27;t know why nobody seems to want to tell that story. Nobody wants to give Judge Waring—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Waring was pushing Marshall even further than Marshall wanted to go.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: At that particular time and Marshall told him, said that this is on our agenda but it&#x27;s not tonight. We don&#x27;t think this is the case. We don&#x27;t think this is the time. The judge said, ‘This is the case and this is the time. I don&#x27;t want to hear another separate but equal case.’ So down at Washington and all that, the press gave Marshall hell for capitulating to the judge. He was, &#x27;Nothing I could do about it. Said, ‘The judge said he didn&#x27;t want to hear it. Don&#x27;t even bring it up as a separate but equal case.’ So the papers said told Thurgood he&#x27;s going to lose and all that. Thurgood said, ‘Yeah I know.’ Sure enough. This is what happened. Then they got to the appellate court, three-judge court they lost just like Judge Waring said they would. Then they were in the Supreme Court, but see I don&#x27;t follow enough () Virginia. Then it was it should have been, it should have been, the Clarendon case, it should&#x27;ve been named for the Clarendon case. What was that named? Briggs. Briggs.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Briggs versus Elliot.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: It should&#x27;ve been Briggs. No. It was the case here was—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Oh Briggs versus The Clarendon County Schools.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. They decided that they didn&#x27;t want another South versus North case.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I see.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: So there were five cases, companion cases all in one, but alphabetically the cases in a companion case suit the cases were named alphabetically. So alphabetically Briggs comes before Brown. Instead of Brown versus the Topeka Board, it should&#x27;ve been Briggs versus the Topeka Board. [Phone ringing] Topeka, Thurgood Marshall won that appeal. He was in Clarendon  County. He was the one that set the whole tone for all of that. They had a lawyer at Brown who was the Jewish lawyer. I&#x27;ve forgotten his name now.  KIERAN TAYLOR: [Jack] Greenberg.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Greenberg, right. He was a Jewish lawyer. He was the lawyer at Briggs. But the case that where the most of the stuff was done, the precedent set was in Clarendon County.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Do you remember the reaction to the decision?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: What?  KIERAN TAYLOR: The reaction to the Brown decision and I&#x27;d imagine you wrote about that how people responded.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You see that was one of the greatest cases in the history of this country because it completely changed the lifestyle of a nation white and black. See when it said all () then legally Plessy versus Ferguson was dead. That was the case that () was dead. It&#x27;s just no more. So it meant that the restaurants and hotels and everything all at first I think there was shock, and then people tried to accommodate the law black and white. White, black businesses took a hit, real hit because for once they&#x27;re being open blacks could go in or eat anywhere they wanted to or live anywhere they wanted to. Immediately, almost immediately probably small black businesses went out of business. That&#x27;s what was expected. That&#x27;s what we were fighting for. Even the black newspapers that were fighting just lost out. But those of us who had these pretty good jobs with black newspapers, we no longer had a job. Well, Courier, the Courier went out along with a lot of other newspapers went out. The Afro is still in existence.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Defender is still around.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Journal-Guide is out.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Do you remember where you were when you heard the decision? You were here in Durham and you remember any kind of—hearing actually hearing the news—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You see the case was a funny case to start with. It was in two parts. It was first heard and then they had a recess. Only God knows why they were having a recess or had the case been decided at the recess at the time of recess Thurgood said, ‘We would&#x27;ve lost it, lost it.’ Then they had a recess. Are you familiar with that?  KIERAN TAYLOR: Um hmm.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You know what happened at the recess?  KIERAN TAYLOR: Well, I&#x27;ve heard bits but you should—  ALEXANDER RIVERA: [Frederick Moore] Vinson died. The Chief Justice from Kentucky, Vinson died. The Lord put his hand in there. We would&#x27;ve lost it sure enough. Then Earl Warren from California was appointed judge Chief Justice, and he was the one who engineered the whole case through, and he got, until he got a unanimous decision. Even when he got a majority, he said don&#x27;t want it. He wasn&#x27;t satisfied with a majority. He got a unanimous decision, and Eisenhower who had appointed Warren, said worst decision, appointing him was the worst decision I ever made in my life. So you want to know, that was a funny decision. Those two things happened. The death of Vinson and the appointment of Earl Warren because we would&#x27;ve lost it in the first, if it would&#x27;ve been decided without a recess. We&#x27;d have lost it. We&#x27;d still have been in the separate but equal.  KIERAN TAYLOR: To what degree did it bring about immediate change in say North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia where you were.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, they all fought it. All fought it. Virginia, North Carolina South, Georgia they all fought it. All said they were—Virginia was terrible. Virginia closed the schools. Virginia said they were going to private schools first. Georgia said the same thing. Of course North Carolina was timid. They weren&#x27;t very, said well most of them said it was the law. They weren&#x27;t anxious to abide by it, but said it was the law. This anyway, it was a little inconceivable that the poorest sections of the country the South had to have two of everything. In Lumberton they had to have three. Down in Robeson county they had to have three. That&#x27;s why I got arrested. I was taking pictures at the back of a theatre down there. The whole back of the theatre wasn&#x27;t anything but toilets because they had Indians. They had Indian men and Indian women, white men, white women, Negro men and Negro women there. The whole back of the building was toilets. I saw it. I started taking pictures of it, and the policeman came up and said, ‘What are you doing?’ I had this press camera, and I said, ‘It&#x27;s obvious what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m taking a picture.’ He said, ‘You&#x27;re under arrest.’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ I had a convertible at the time. He told me to get in the car. I said, ‘In that car there is a lot of camera equipment.’ I said, ‘Now are you going to be responsible for this.’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘You get in your car and follow me.’ I said, ‘Okay.’ So I followed him around to the courthouse. The chief of police said, ‘What are you arresting this man for?’ He said, ‘Taking pictures back of the theatre.’ The chief said, ‘Is there a law against that?’ He said, ‘Yeah.’ The police chief said, ‘You go find the law and come back.’ So he asked me he says after he had him to go to the law he said, ‘Are you in a hurry?’ I said, ‘I&#x27;m not in a hurry chief, but I would like to be out of your town before dark.’ I said, so he came back and said, ‘I couldn&#x27;t find it but I know there&#x27;s a law. I know there&#x27;s a law.’ So the chief dismissed him and told me I could go.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I know that before the national, well the sit-ins started in Greensboro there were some attempts here with Reverend [Douglas] Moore.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: There weren&#x27;t any.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Nothing.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Attempts. Greensboro got the idea. We were years before Greensboro.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That&#x27;s what I thought.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: We had the sit-in. I mean we were at the court. We went all the way to the state supreme court with that case. Five years, I think it was five years before A and T did anything. It was at the Royal Ice Cream Parlor that was located in the black neighborhood and it was down on Dobbs Street. Blacks could not go in there. They could go around to the back and get something. Blacks couldn&#x27;t go in there.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now who would&#x27;ve organized that? Who would&#x27;ve put that together or lead that?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: You just named him.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Was it Reverend Moore, was Reverend Moore a part of that?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: He was the organizer.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah, that&#x27;s what I thought.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: He organized it. Moore, Elaine Moore. First name was Elaine. Douglas Elaine Moore.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Douglas.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Now it all comes back to me. Douglas Elaine Moore. Douglas Elaine Moore went to school in Boston, same school that Martin Luther King went to. He got an idea that he was Martin Luther King or something, but anyway he organized the sit-in, and it was the first sit-in. A and T came years after. This case, this wasn&#x27;t just an ordinary sit-in. They had judges the only lawyer living now is William Marsh. William Marsh is still living. The other lawyers are dead. There was M. Hugh Thompson, and I don&#x27;t know who the other lawyer was. But they&#x27;re dead. This case went all the way to the Supreme Court.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now did you cover that as a journalist?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I wasn&#x27;t here.  KIERAN TAYLOR: You weren&#x27;t here at that point.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: (). Wasn&#x27;t here. But I have it all the record of it and the names of it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Great.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: All that.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I&#x27;m sure there are people you would have—  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  ALEXANDER RIVERA: As I told you the first one that we had here for the Royal ice-cream company. That was the one Reverend Moore and several students he got together. Then of course we had A and T started the sit-ins at the counter of the Woolworth&#x27;s store. Our students then started copying that so he went to the Woolworth&#x27;s store here. They had a counter here and we sat in. But we didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to that because we already had our sit-ins. As I told you it went all the way through the courts. I had a friend named Louis Austin and Louis Austin was the editor and publisher of the Carolina Times newspaper. Good friend of mine and I used to work around with him. Never charged him a dime for anything. () about along and one day he said, ‘Let&#x27;s go down to the Woolworth&#x27;s store and sit in and see how they&#x27;re getting along.’ I said, ‘All right.’ ‘You&#x27;ve got your camera.’ ‘Yeah. I&#x27;ve got my camera. Yeah.’ So we got down there, and there was a vacant seat at the counter. So lo and behold Louis Austin just had to sit in this vacant seat. Somebody poured something hot on him. It was coffee or soup or something. He jumped up and started screaming and carrying on and he said, ‘Now listen.’ Says, ‘Those down at that end and that end, those are the non-violent ones.’ He said, ‘I&#x27;m violent as hell.’ That was, you were asking me about my experience with the sit-in. That was my experience with the sit-in. But we left there with him and his suit messed up and came out. We didn&#x27;t do much with it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: But as far as taking pictures for the Courier would you have, would they have wanted some photos?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: We did some, but they weren&#x27;t really interested in. The movement was in Greensboro as far as they were concerned. We never got, we never got (the go ahead) in this town for the sit-ins. I went to the News and Observer and gave them the history of it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now who would&#x27;ve been the editor of the Courier at this point?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Mrs. Vann. It was either it was, yeah, Mrs. Vann was still, Daisy Lampkin. I worked for Bill Nunn. Bill Nunn, Sr. because there was a Bill Nunn Jr. who wrote in the sports department. I reported to Bill Nunn, I reported to Bill Nunn, Sr. So I would&#x27;ve reported to him. All of them are dead now, Mrs. Lampkin, Mrs. Vann.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I just would&#x27;ve thought that they would&#x27;ve assigned you to go over to Greensboro and get some pictures but no.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know how they got over there. As I said we had had our experience here with it so—  KIERAN TAYLOR: It had played out to the Supreme Court you were saying.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. Hadn&#x27;t done anything. See Hugo Black, Hugo Black there was, he came in, he came into the Washington scene while I was there working as a reporter. It was revealed that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and of course the black community (), and we did a lot of writing about Hugo Black. We had a case it was, of course it was a separate but equal case down in North Carolina. I covered the case in the Supreme Court. It was, they were testing the validity of the out of state aid that the southern states were giving to black schools in order to take a course something that wasn&#x27;t available at the black school. See this is Woolworth. All this was Greensboro. Jim Rice—  KIERAN TAYLOR: The journalist?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: He wrote a story—I don&#x27;t know if he wrote it. He wrote a story on the case—that&#x27;s all right. Is that it?  KIERAN TAYLOR: I don&#x27;t think so.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: But he did write a story about the sit-ins, and he put it, he (). So I knew he got it straight and, but we didn&#x27;t do anything much on it.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I know that a couple of months after the sit-ins then the students got together, met at Shaw in Raleigh for the organizations of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s something you might have been over to cover as a reporter.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Uh uh.  KIERAN TAYLOR: No.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: A lot of that I wasn&#x27;t working. A lot of that I wasn&#x27;t working for the Courier.  KIERAN TAYLOR: This would&#x27;ve been April &#x27;60. You were gone from the Courier by then?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I think so. I was trying to get, I was trying to make some money. I went to work for the Joslen, Joslen Jewelry Company.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay, sure.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: See August 1969. But I went to work for the Courier because I (). So I wasn&#x27;t here. That&#x27;s one reason they didn&#x27;t recommend I do something on the sit-ins. I wasn&#x27;t here. But I was living on the corner right in front of the school. Lot of demonstrations came right by my house.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I believe that yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: We didn&#x27;t have any fires. We didn&#x27;t have any shootings at North Carolina College. We didn&#x27;t have any of that. Lot of noise, a lot of protests. Students left the campus went out to protest in the city but the, it was an odd thing about the kids at North Carolina College. They seemed to want to protect their school. They didn&#x27;t want to burn it down like some places had fires. We had small fires in some wastebaskets and bathrooms and things but no big fires and no shooting.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I want to go back to the 1957 trip with Richard Nixon, and I&#x27;m wondering how that came about. How, why did you get to go with Vice President Nixon?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Well, I was, just a second. I have so much junk there. Cut that off just a second. Do you have it cut off?  KIERAN TAYLOR: Yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: All right. 1955 we received an award, a journalism achievement award by the Global News Syndicate Incorporated. I received one, a joint award with Robert Radcliffe. We worked together at the Courier, and Nixon received an award, a distinguished public service award. So we were at this meeting. We received the award together. So that was, what date was that?  KIERAN TAYLOR: June 24th, 1955.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: All right. In 1957 one morning I was getting ready to go to work about eight-thirty, eight or something. I got a call from the State Department. I didn&#x27;t know it was the State Department and said Mr. Nixon wanted me to go with him to Africa. I thought it was a prank. I was rushing to go to work, and I figured somebody was playing a prank on me. So I said, ‘Yeah. Yeah. Well you tell Nixon to take his mama to Africa with him.’ I hung up. So about as soon as this guy called back and the phone rang again and said, ‘Hey, don&#x27;t hang up.’ Says, ’This is no joke. Take this number down and call us back in a few minutes.’ I said, ‘What number?’ It was the Washington number to the State Department. I said, ‘Yeah, I believe this is a joke,’ but I took the number down and I called him back. They said, ‘No,’ said, ‘Mr. Nixon wants you to go to Africa with him.’ Now he wasn&#x27;t going to Africa without some blacks. I don&#x27;t know how many blacks he knew. He was a little bit pressed against the wall. That&#x27;s how I got to go with him.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: So we got our shots and everything and got ready to go to Africa.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Nixon had an entourage right on the plane.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh yeah. We had a plane.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Who all was on that plane?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: See we had a plane and he, of course had Air Force number two () planes. Let&#x27;s see.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Would [E. Frederic] Morrow have been working in the—?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: He was there.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah, Morrow was one. A guy named Barnett.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Claude Barnett.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Claude Barnett was there. Barnett of the Associated Negro Press.  KIERAN TAYLOR: With his wife Etta Moten Barnett.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah, she was a hundred years old. I got an invitation to her hundredth anniversary.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Is that right?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Etta at a hundred.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Wow.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Johnsons were there. Johnson Publications.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Johnson, yeah.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: He had Moneta Sleet. Moneta Sleet was there. He was the first black I know that won a Pulitzer prize in photography. He was there. Had another reporter from Washington worked with the Johnson Publications. Booker, Simeon Booker.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Simeon Booker.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I can&#x27;t think of—oh, oh. I should never forget him. His name was—he worked for Afro-American.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Lomax.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No. A little guy. He was there too. Lomax went, but this guy was. I&#x27;ll think of it after a while. He reason why, oh gosh I can&#x27;t think of his name. But () he took shorthand. So every time the reporters would get in a situation where they had to choose between always asking him to go because he could get more than anybody else because he did shorthand. Of course now I can&#x27;t think of his name.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Any politicians with Mr. Nixon? Like I assumed Powell would&#x27;ve gone a different plane, Adam Clayton Powell  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, he wasn&#x27;t on there.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Randolph. Dr. King, I think traveled separately.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah they were on, they didn&#x27;t go with us.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Now was the first step, was the first, you flew from New York to Gold Coast.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: No, Rabat, Morocco.  KIERAN TAYLOR: First to Morocco. Was that just a stop over?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What was the first destination point?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I don&#x27;t even know. I think we were, because we stopped and refueled once and went into Morocco. Louis Lautier.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Okay.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I knew I was going to think of that name. The name was Louis Lautier.  KIERAN TAYLOR: That&#x27;s right.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: He did shorthand and he was quite popular.  KIERAN TAYLOR: I assume this was your first trip to Africa.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. And only trip to Africa.  KIERAN TAYLOR: Only trip.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: First and last trip to Africa I think. Yeah, we went into Canada and on around.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What was that like, I mean, your first experience of Africa? Do you have any memories of what that?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Yeah. All my memories of Africa were good until I got to Liberia. I think Liberia would&#x27;ve been okay if I hadn&#x27;t already made up my mind that, as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve always wanted to see a country that was run independently by blacks with a record of at least a hundred years. Here this was perfect. Liberia had been black operated over a hundred years independently. When I got there, it was terrible. It was the most () that I&#x27;ve ever seen. I was very much disgusted. () they didn&#x27;t have any democracy. It was run by a tyrant. So I said now I&#x27;ve seen it. I know what it looks like. () years. We went to Tubman&#x27;s in charge. They had a ball for us at Tubman&#x27;s presidents. A lady came up to me and says, ‘Oh what are you going to write about us?’ I said, ‘I&#x27;m just going to tell the truth.’ She said, ’You never will be able to come back.’ She was right. I filed my story from Monroe in Liberia. The embassy in Washington protested. So they said, ‘Well, if there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s incorrect, we&#x27;ll be glad to correct it.’ ‘No, there weren&#x27;t any corrections. He didn&#x27;t have to say all this here.’ That&#x27;s all they said. ‘He could&#x27;ve left a lot out, left a lot of stuff out.’ I wouldn&#x27;t have had any story. They had uprisings shortly after. You know about that don&#x27;t you? Marched them down to the ocean and shot them Tubman and all the rest of them.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What about in Ghana did you meet Nkrumah? Did you have a chance to?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Oh yeah.  KIERAN TAYLOR: What was that like? Where was that? I mean there were a whole series of inauguration festivities.  ALEXANDER RIVERA: I don&#x27;t know exactly what the occasion was. But you see he had gone to school here in this country. Liberia, I mean in Ghana there was Nkrumah. In Nigeria there was Azikiwe. Both educated in the States and both as far as England was concerned were radicals. So much so that England said we&#x27;re not going to send any more people to the States for education because when they pass, see the Statue of Liberty something happens to them. But those were the two that I remember from the States, Azikiwe and Nkrumah  KIERAN TAYLOR: Did you happen to see Dr. King when you were in Ghana?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Just saw him—  KIERAN TAYLOR: Just in passing, yeah. Would that have been the first time you had seen him or had you ever seen him before if you can remember?  ALEXANDER RIVERA: Not that I can remember. He wasn&#x27;t that famous. He was at my estimation at that time he was just regarded as a good speaker.

before I arrived, but there was some modifications to it that c;
Ibility. My predecessor had really been more
associated with the design prior to my arrival.
BB: Can you give me some detail about your role in this project.
GW: Well under the law, the architect of the Capital is responsible
to design and construct the building, so we had architects from the
private sector because it was a much :han our in-house
staff could do. We did the design work then we let co
the construction. All those d the expenditure func
and for the design decisions had to be approved by Senator Jordan as
chairman of the coordinating committee, and all the other Senators
and members of the house that were involved in that deferred to his
judgement--if it happened to be a major policy decision he would call
them all together and have a meeting; from time to time that was done.
He was sort of the guiding light for that until he left here.
BB: I understand, Mr. White, that there wr some efforts made to
relocate the building and Senator Jordan worked real hard to keep it
where it was.
W: Yes there were some made to relocate it, and there was
also an effort made to occupy part of it by the House of Representatives
which was looking for space, and so Senator Jordan, in protection of
the library&#x27;s needs took the opposite position and of course that&#x27;s
what prevailed, since we do have the building there now.
BB: Did you have occasion to see him persuading other people to
agree with his particular viewpoint?
GW: Oh yes on a number of occasions. :or Jordan, was in my
or&gt;inion--my observation--approached those kinds

very kindly way. He was not the kind of person, in my memory, who
would try to force_ h_i_s_ way. He tried to persuadej^-hj5_wasn \.t_ a table
pounder--he tried to persuade on the basis of reason and he usually
prevailed. I think his past experiences in the private sector, in
industry had made him very pragmatic in that regard. He was a kind
to make
of person that tried to accomplish_the goal rather than to try/his
views prevail just because they happened to be his views. He was
also very easily--he would very easily understand an opposing view.
In my experience he tried to accomplish the goal and if it turned out
that someone else had a better idea he&#x27;d go along with that, b
it was the goal that was important, not to just have his own ideas
prevail.
BB: That&#x27;s an important point. Back in Saxapahaw where the mill
is located, in the village, we used to say that he designed every
put up. When he came to Washington we built a Boy Scout when
I was scoutmaster and we jokingly said, &quot;That was one building he
did not design in
some small
ipahaw.&quot; So when he came to Washington he had

GW: Well, he of course because of complications deferred to the
technical
professional advice he would get in terms of/matters, but in terms of
basic policy he knew exactly what he wanted, but he listened can
to people whose judgement he respected, and he was very good about
that.
BB: So you would call him a good listener?
GW: I would.

BB: How was he at expressing his own views, was he very articulate?
JW: Yes, he was articulate in a simple way. He didn&#x27;t use a lot_ of
complicated language — simple straightforward language—you always
understood him, and you always knew where he stood. He didn&#x27;t twist
his words around. He was straightforward in the way he spoke.
BB: Did he ever use any humor in getting a point across?

^urther you&#x27;d like to say about him as a Senator or a person?
~W: He was a loyal person. If you were his friend you could count
on his loyalty. If he had a basis for friendship by knowing you and
you did something maybe you shouldn&#x27;t have done, his first thought
was not that you did something bad, but must have
happened because he knew you wouldn&#x27;t have done that on purpose. He
who could be considered friends benefitted by that in knowing him.

<dc:description>This is Ben Bulla, November 15, 1985 in the Office of Mr. George White, Architect for the Capitol.  He worked with Senator Jordan when he was in Washington as Chairman of the Rules Committee and during the construction of the James Madison Library of Congress building. BB:  Mr. White, thank you very much for agreeing to see me this morning. If you will, tell me about your first meeting with Senator Jordan and we will progress from there. GW:  Well because Senator Jordan was chairman of the Senate committee on rules and administration he had jurisdiction over the activities of the office of the architect insorfar as the Senate side is concerned, because the Senate committee on rules has jurisdiction over space assignment on the Senate side of the Capitol and in the Senate office buildings as well as any modifications to the buildings as well as the ordering of furniture and furnishings and all the things that have to do with the physical plant come under the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee on the Senate side, and since Senator Jordan was the chairman of that he and I had to work closely together.  My first recollection of Senator Jordan was during the decorating of the room you are now in and that I occupy here.  My predecessor had not done anything with it for a long time and I was having it painted and new carpeting put in and that sort of thing.  There were some old packing cases in here and it was a shambles, and he came to visit me one day and he didn&#x27;t mind it a bit.  I  apologized for it and he said, &quot;It dosen&#x27;t bother me&quot; and he sat down on one of those wooden crates and we talked.  That was my first recollection of Senator Jordan.  He was very cordial and friendly and was a good friend to me all the time he was here.  Now as it turned out, when the James Madison Memorial George White 11-15-85                                                                                                 2 Library building was being designed, and later constructed, under the way in which the congress has organized an entity called the joint committee on the library which has responsibility for all the library activities, the chairman of the Rules Committee and the chairman of the committee on House Administration, and Senator Jordan as chairman of The Rules Committee on the Senate side alternate being chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library at every congress, and as it turned out at that period of time Senator Jordan was chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library.  So he and I had to work together in connection of the design and construction of the library building.   When he wasn&#x27;t the chairman he would be the vice chairman and it would rotate from the House to the Senate side. Because the James Madison Memorial Library Building by law was under the jurisdiction  of several entitiesfor example, the joint committee on the library, and by law the house office building commission and the Senate office building commission and then because it was also a memorial to James Madison there was also a James Madison Memorial Commission.  So there were a lot of people involved and when decisions needed to be made it was a problem to get everyone together.  So with everybody&#x27;s agreement Senator Jordan was made the chairman of what they called the coordinating coiimiittee for the library, so that we wouldn&#x27;t have to have the chairmen of all these groups come together, and he was made that on a permenant basis, and that meant that I worked with him directly for the library and we had many opportunities to work together in order to get descisions made about the dgsign of the library, and of course the library of congress was heavily involved since it was his building, he was in effect what George White 11-15-85 3 you might call a client.  And so the librarian of congress and I and Senator Jordan worked closely together. BB:  Did you find him knowledgeable? GW:  He was very knowledgeable--he was very pragmatic, he understood the problems whatever they might be and he understood them very quickly, and he always had a pragmatic_so1 ution.  He cut to the heart of the problem very quickly and would suggest a solution and if it seemed acceptable well that was the way we went.  He was pretty good at persuasion so many of his ideas became acceptable soultions to everybody.  He was very pragmatic, he was a very personajo^e_.._ijidj.y_idual, very cordial and friendly, courteous.  I was just a freshman here, I didn&#x27;t know my way around very well and he kind of took me under his wing and guided me and he was a good friend *_ BB:  How long were you here before he came? GW:  Oh he was here when I arrived.  In other words I was a freshman and he had been here a number of years.  I didn&#x27;t come here until 1971. BB:  What year did you build the library? GW:  The library began to be constructed in 1971 shortly after I arrived--in terms of foundations and excavations, but the design of the upper portion of the building was still in process.  In other words it was done on a phased basis, so there were lots of design decisions having to be made even though construction was taking place. BB:  Were you the man that was responsible for the design of the building? GW:  The design of the building was basically accomplished just George White 11-15-85                                                                                                 4 before I arrived, but there was some modifications to it that came under my responsibility.  My predecessor had really been more associated with the design prior to my arrival. BB:  Can you give me some detail about your role in this project. GW:  Well under the law, the architect of the Capital is responsible to design and construct the building, so we had architects from the private sector because it was a much bigger job than our in-house staff could do.  We did the design work then we let contracts for the construction.  All those decisions for the expenditure funds and for the design decisions had to be approved by Senator Jordan as chairman of the coordinating committee, and all the other Senators and members of the house that were involved in that deferred to his judgementif it happened to be a major policy decision he would call them all together and have a meeting; from time to time that was done.

When he came to Washington we built a Boy Scout cabin when I was scoutmaster and we jokingly said, &quot;That was one building he did not design in Saxapahaw.&quot;  So when he came to Washington he had some small experience on that level but nothing like this magnitude, these are very fine, beautiful buildings; quite a contrast to a cotton mill.

BB:  Quite frankly, Bill is just too busy; I can&#x27;t get him off the telephone or away from meetings.  Right now he&#x27;s in a meeting on buying new telephone system for the capitolor senate. GW:  The Senate.  Well Bill is so good he&#x27;s in demand.  That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s busy. BB:  I&#x27;ve been teasing him about coming down to N. C. and spending a day or two with me to get him away from the telephone. Thank you very much for your time; this has been a very interesting conversation.  What was that last comment you made about Jordan? GW:  He was a great man.  He was a great man.</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Tape 9, Side A This tape begins with a description of the start-up activities the summer of 1950 when Clark arrived in Chapel Hill. He reflects on his relationships with Billy Carmichael, Chancellor Robert Burton House, Claude Teague, including mention of such things as Teague&#x27;s business in running the non-academic side of the University and House&#x27;s role as the chief academic assistant to Frank Graham during the 1930&#x27;s. He also reflects on the process of naming the future university hospitol as well as creating a title for his position. This side concludes with Clark&#x27;s relationship with Dean Berryhill and the increasing tension that evolved in their relationship. Tape 9, Side B This side begins with mention of the start-up relationships with other programs in Health Affairs. Clark mentions his presentation to the Governor and the Advisory Budget Commission in July 1951 regarding the Budget for Health Affairs. He mentions such figures as Mac Norwood who served as the Business Officer in the hospitol in the 1950s and the appointments of Dean Kemble, Dean Brecht, and Dr. Cadmus to the University.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>89 INTERVIEW 7 March 6,1994 FRANCES WEAVER: This is an interview with Dr. Henry Toole Clark, Jr., and it is taking place at Dr. Clark&#x27;s home on Gray Bluff Trail in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on March 6, 1994. Henry, in the last two interviews we had you set the stage for discussing the work you had been assigned when you came to Chapel Hill. Let&#x27;s talk about your main start-up activities in that summer of 1950. HENRY TOOLE CLARK: Fran, let me first add one &quot;P.S.&quot; to our interview of January 20, 1994. In that interview I stated that the starting point for developing the legislation which led to the creation of the expanded medical center in Chapel Hill was a visit by five top leaders of the North Carolina Medical Society with Governor Broughton in early January 1944. It should be noted, however, that periodically for many preceding years and especially during the early 1940s after Reece Berryhill became Dean of the Medical School, considerable consideration had been given within the University and beyond it to the desirability, indeed the urgency, of expanding the two year Basic Sciences School to a full four year program. All of the 12-15 two-year medical schools in the country were having difficulties attracting faculty and all were having problems of introducing their students to clinical medicine at the appropriate time in the absence of adequate hospital facilities. Furthermore, there were indications that the accrediting bodies would sooner or later phase out all of the existing two-year schools of medicine. Thus, Dean Berryhill, who was an astute politician, began early on to develop friends and supporters for the idea of expanding his school. His recruits included members of the UNC administration and Trustees, selected leaders of the State Medical Society and a number of public figures in North Carolina. Indeed, the expansion of the school became an obsession for Reece and he had developed some strong support for the idea, as well as aroused some strong opposition, by the time our story began in January 1944. FW: Henry, I assume that this advance build-up of support is a necessary component to launching any large projects in the University. Do you agree with that? HC: Yes. Now let&#x27;s turn to my beginning work activities in Chapel Hill. On my first day of work, which occurred in early June 1950, the day after the UNC graduation exercises were completed, I had a conference with Dean Ed McGavran of the School of Public Health. Ed had been Acting Administrator of the Division of Health Affairs during the previous 18 months. I wanted to get up-to-date on the evolving situation in the new medical center and to identify those matters which, in his judgment, needed my first attention. From our past discussions you will recall that late in 1948, following up Legislative action, President Graham and Chancellor House had appointed a committee composed of Dean W.R. Berryhill, Dean ML. Jacobs, Dr. R.E. Coker, and Dean McGavran to propose the structure and function of a Division of Health and Medical Affairs and to recommend an individual qualified to head such an organization. On March 8, 1949, that Committee, after due study, submitted its report, which was approved by the Board of Trustees. The main elements of that report, which related to the organization and functioning of the Division and the duties and CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 90 responsibilities of the Administrator, later became the introductory paragraphs of the &quot;Code&quot;, i.e. &quot;Rules, Regulations and Policies of the Division of Health Affairs.&quot; By September 15, 1949, the need for responsible leadership for the Division became so great that this Committee, at its own recommendation, was transformed into an Official Board, which would eventually be expanded to include the Deans of the five Schools of the Division, the Director of the Hospital, and Dr. RE. Coker representing the Main Academic Campus Faculty. FW: Who was RE. Coker? HC: Dr. Coker was Chairman of the Department of Zoology and a Kenan Professor in the University. Dean McGavran was officially made the Acting Administrator and Chairman. That Board, which would reach its full complement as key members were recruited, was to oversee the beginning construction of those new facilities which had been authorized by the State Legislature. Also, it was to intensify the search for a full time Division Administrator, for a Hospital Director and for new Deans of Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy, the last to replace Dean Jacobs, who had died in March 1950. That Executive Board also was to coordinate the functioning of the several elements of the Division and in the early phases of its operation it made a few preliminary policy decision which we discussed earlier. That Board also, in time, took over the functions of the Administrative Boards which served each School and Division of the University and were made up of selected general faculty members who served as &quot;outside advisors&quot; to the Deans and Directors concerned. FW: By &quot;outside&quot; you mean it could be anybody from any academic . . . HC: Any segment of the University. This simply brought neutral or objective thinking to bear in the policy development of the Schools or Departments concerned, and it was advisory rather than executive in its function. As Acting Administrator and Chairman Dean McGavran made a full report of the functioning of the fledgling Health Affairs Board through mid-January 1950. He made no further written report after I agreed in January to become full time Administrator in June 1950. Fran, you can imagine how much I was looking forward to getting Dr. McGavran&#x27;s update and assessment of the situation and to working with him during the next few weeks to take over the administrative reins in an orderly transition. I was in for a rude shock! In my meeting with him in my new office in Miller Hall, which had only a few items of furniture and no telephone or secretary, I obtained a limited briefing on the current status of building plans and construction and on the search for key personnel. More important, I learned that Dr. McGavran, himself, would be leaving for the summer in two or three days to work as a consultant on a Public Health project in Vancouver, Canada-I think it was. He planned to turn over the summer reins of the School of Public Health to Dr. John Wright, who would serve as Acting Dean. Dr. McGavran offered to make available, on a temporary basis, a secretary from the School of Public Health who had some limited familiarity with his activities as Acting Division Administrator. He advised me to work actively to recruit my own secretary. This episode brought me face to face with the reality that all the faculty in the University, including the medical elements, were on a nine month appointment basis, with the summers available for research or personal pursuits or for supplementing academic salaries by part-time teaching or consultantships. I had, of course, come from situations at Rochester and Vanderbilt where there was intense work activity in the Hospital and throughout many departments in the CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 91 Medical Schools twenty-four hours per day, 365 days per year. I saw the need in the new Division of Health Affairs at UNC to place all faculty and staff on a twelve months appointment basis to support year round hospital operations and to carry out expanded summer teaching and research programs. This would be more demanding for them than the situation faced by their counterparts on the Main Campus and would require changes in life style for many existing long-term faculty members. FW: So you really had to develop your own agenda from the beginning without much guidance from Dr. McGavran or anybody else for that matter. HC: Yes, Fran, but actually that wasn&#x27;t too bad or very difficult. As an obvious first step I needed to talk individually with a number of key people in both the academic and administrative sides of the University. I wanted to get each man&#x27;s assessment of the background and the evolving situation in Health Affairs, to listen to his concerns and suggestions and to start building good personal relationships with many people in responsible positions with whom I would be working closely for many years. My early interviews with members of the University Administration involved primarily Billy Carmichael (at that point Acting President of the Consolidated University), Robert House (Chancellor of UNC-CH), Claude Teague (Business Manager), A.H. &quot;Buster&quot; Shepherd (Assistant Business Manager), John Bennett (Director of Buildings and Grounds), Joe Hakan (University Engineer), and J.A. Branch (Purchasing Director). Also, with Bob Madry (Director of the UNC News Bureau). Each conference contributed to my understanding of the general functioning of the University and of the current status of the developing medical center. Also, each conference identified topics which needed further exploration and this, in turn, expanded my interview schedule. I found each of these people to be warm and responsible individuals, who were committed to their work and to the development of the University as a major resource to the people of North Carolina. They wanted to be helpful to me and seemed to accept me from the beginning as one of them. FW: Let&#x27;s talk a little bit about your beginning relationships especially with Billy Carmichael-William Donald Carmichael, Jr.,-Chancellor Robert Burton House, and Claude Teague who was at that time the Business Manager. HC: Billy Carmichael was a very complex and sensitive man who stands out in my mind as the most creative individual I knew during over forty years of work with nine different universities. He had an enormous capacity to dream impossible dreams for UNC and, step by step, to translate those dreams into buildings and people and programs. As the chief financial officer of the Consolidated University he was the official liaison with the State Administration and Legislature. He was the principal assistant and the best ally and friend of three University Presidents; Frank Graham, Gordon Gray, and Bill Friday. His sense of humor was legendary and I can hear him now delighting a group of legislators with the comment that his role in the University was &quot;to humanize the sciences and simonize the humanities.&quot; Also, &quot;to persuade good men to come to Chapel Hill and then to keep them apart after they got here.&quot; Billy&#x27;s work habits were unpredictable except that he started each day with prayer at the local Catholic Church. FW: Which he had a part in founding I do believe, I mean, in the actual building of St. Thomas Moore. HC: I think that&#x27;s right, Fran. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 92 He had been a prime architect of the Good Health Campaign which helped to pave the way for the legislation which created the expanded medical center in Chapel Hill; so, he had a big stake in my successful functioning, and he was personally and professionally supportive in many ways. We became good friends. Years later, in June 1984, as a columnist for the Chapel Hill Newspaper I wrote &quot;A Tribute to the Late, Great Billy Carmichael&quot; which tells my story in detail. That story was distributed by the Alumni Review to 125,000 UNC alumni. FW: That&#x27;s great. I think also you and Billy were tennis pals. Were you not? HC: Well, we might talk a little more about that later on because he played a major role in my extensive tennis activity later on. FW: Well, let&#x27;s talk some about Bob House, Chancellor of the University. HC: Bob House served as the chief academic assistant to Frank Graham during the 1930s. He was elevated to Chancellor at UNC-CH when Graham became President of the Consolidated University. Bob House was a warm, good-humored and very bright individual-I recall he had been President of Phi Beta Kappa as an undergraduate-who carried out his administrative duties with a very light rein. He seemed to feel that as Chancellor he was presiding over an assembly of scholars and that his primary mission was to help those scholars achieve their own goals. He would help others to implement their innovative ideas but he developed few initiatives of his own. He seemed comfortable with the classical Ivory Tower concept of the University. The Chancellor was at his best as presiding officer on many ceremonial occasions, which he often launched in a festive way by playing a few notes on his harmonica. FW: Absolutely. HC: House had not played any major part in the flow of events leading up to creating the expanding medical center. He viewed the new Division of Health Affairs as a large and complex new enterprise about which he knew little, and he wanted me to take over full administrative responsibility for him without unduly involving him. He seemed to have confidence in my ability to do that. While he had good insights and understanding of human beings, he was uncomfortable in dealing with problems relating to personality conflicts and departmental rivalries. Bob House recognized that Billy Carmichael wanted and needed to be fully informed and involved in Health Affairs matters, and he was quite comfortable that I developed an extensive direct relationship with Billy. I simply kept the Chancellor informed about any significant discussions with Billy. Incidentally, Bob House&#x27;s primary academic assistant and my counterpart for the &quot;Main Campus&quot; was Coriden &quot;Shorty&quot; Spruill. Shorty was a Christian Scientist and I a physician, but we got along famously and became strong partners in many situations despite the fact that we were rivals in seeking money for our respective programs. FW: Yes, he was a great guy. HC: Now let me say a few words about Claude Teague. Claude was the Chancellor&#x27;s right hand man in running the total business or non-academic side of the University and he and Buster Shepherd were Billy Carmichael&#x27;s main sources of advice and data relating to budgets and dealings with the State Administration and the Legislature. I recall that Claude Teague had been a superintendent of a public school system before coming to UNC. He was a thin, gaunt man, seldom speaking at meetings but absorbing everything that went on. He was a sensitive and perceptive person and a good judge of men. He had assembled a good staff to oversee the non-academic departments and those staff members were very loyal and supportive. Claude also had the full confidence of both Bob House and CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 93 Billy Carmichael and he, of course, attended most of the senior level meetings with Trustees and members of the State Administration. Claude Teague and I became close friends and working associates. He was naturally apprehensive about the demands which the proliferating new Health Affairs Division would make on the total business operations under his command. Despite my youth and relative inexperience I think he felt I had the courage of my convictions and would exercise good common sense in many difficult situations. Also, he was relieved to have someone from the academic side to work with who had &quot;met a pay-roll&quot;, who did not &quot;wear a white coat&quot; and who understood and respected the roles of the non-academic staff. Claude and I conferred frequently, both formally and informally. Without being indiscreet or disloyal to his own superiors, Claude became my main source of information about machinations at the top administrative levels of the University and, perhaps more important, he was a friendly interpreter of my views in many closed sessions. Fran, perhaps it may have some historical, or at least human interest value, to give my recollection of a chance conversation involving Bob House, Claude Teague, Billy Carmichael, and me in late June 1950. I had dropped by the Chancellor&#x27;s office on the first floor of South Building overlooking the &quot;Y&quot; courtyard to bring him up to date on my activities. It was a hot day and the windows were open because there was no air-conditioning and there was a buzz of activity in the &quot;Y&quot; Court outside. Soon Claude Teague and then Billy Carmichael stopped by. As we talked a point was made that my title had never been officially set. The term &quot;Administrator&quot; had been used but &quot;Vice Chancellor&quot; was more appropriate and had been recommended by the McGavran Committee. I would be the first &quot;Vice chancellor&quot; in the University. Bob House and Billy Carmichael said they wanted to avoid taking a step which would lead to a proliferation of Vice Chancellors in the University. Would I mind making the title Administrator Official? I agreed with some reluctance because I foresaw, as proved correct, that in the future I would frequently be thought of as the head of the hospital only. The term Vice Chancellor would have been more descriptive and would have carried more prestige. Another discussion point concerned the name of the hospital. The logical name, which carried a hallmark of quality, was The University of North Carolina Hospital, but during the Good Health Movement, which occurred just after the close of World War II, there had developed some sentiment state-wide to establish a major hospital as the capstone of a state-wide hospital system which would be a fitting memorial to all North Carolinians who had died in past wars in the service of their state and country. So &quot;The North Carolina Memorial Hospital&quot; became the name. Likewise our discussion noted that the new Division of the University was being referred to at different times as the &quot;Division of Health Sciences&quot; and the &quot;Division of Medical and Health Affairs.&quot; Billy Carmichael was persuasive in advocating &quot;Division of Health Affairs&quot;, saying &quot;Health Affairs&quot; had a positive, happy ring, like &quot;Love Affairs&quot;, and that it was a broad term which covered Public Health, Nursing, Dentistry, and Pharmacy in addition to Medicine. So, having made some mighty decisions the group adjourned to go to lunch at the Monogram Club. FW: Which is now, incidentally the Office of Undergraduate Admissions but at that time had a restaurant in it. HC: Right. FW: Henry, you must have had similar, and probably more extensive, early discussions with the top leaders of the University and with leaders in the Division of Health Affairs. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 94 HC: Yes. And the need for those discussions came into sharp focus on my first work day when I learned that I must submit detailed operating budgets for 1950-51 for each unit in the Division before July 1, 1950. Also, that I must be prepared to defend those budgets and discuss in a preliminary way our anticipated budget requests for the 1951-53 biennium with the Governor and his Advisory Budget Commission at a meeting tentatively set for early July. All this was complicated by the fact that only Reece Berryhill and John Brauer were at work in Chapel Hill during the summer, that Ed McGavran was away consulting in Canada, that Bob Cadmus was not scheduled to arrive in Chapel Hill until September 1 and that the appointments of Betty Kemble as Dean of the School of Nursing and Ed Brecht as Dean of the School of Pharmacy were in process. They would later be confirmed and available for full time service on September 1. One bright spot was that Critz George, a Professor of Anatomy, who served as Chairman of the Division Library Committee for several years, was available to provide help in that field. During one of our earlier interview, Fran, I discussed the scope of the teaching programs envisioned for the expanded Division of Health Affairs. The plans in this regard were refined considerably during the summer and fall of 1950, since each program had implications for budget development. Of course, the detailed refinement of each program awaited the recruitment of specialized personnel responsible for each. FW: How did you proceed to develop these budget requests for the Advisory Budget Commission in the absence of so many key people in the Division of Health Affairs? HC: Well, Fran, my first objective really was to develop the budget for 1950-51 for which appropriations had already been made but the budget itself needed to be detailed. I first talked at length on several occasions with Dean Reece Berryhill of the School of Medicine. He had focused heavily during the previous two years on working with architects in planning the main hospital and then serving as the primary &quot;owner-representative&quot; in discussing many spot construction issues with the builders after the contracts were let in the early fall of 1949. Reece was happy to turn over that latter responsibility to me and, through me, to Bob Cadmus, with whom I talked frequently by telephone. Recce&#x27;s &quot;plate was full&quot; with another large set of concerns. He was involved in expanding the staff of the Basic Science Departments and in planning make-shift physical arrangements to teach the basic science part of the curriculum for the first class of dental students who were scheduled to start their course work in early September 1950. Just as pressing, he was involved in planning several new facilities: first, a major extension of the North Wing of the School of Medicine to provide additional space for three of the six Basic Science Departments to carry out their expanding teaching programs for dental, nursing, pharmacy and allied health students in an effective way; second, the renovation of the third floor of the UNC Student Infirmary and the addition of a fourth floor to house the developing Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, for which no space had been planned in the main North Carolina Memorial Hospital; and third, the development of facilities for cancer research above the out-patient wing of the Hospital, for which a substantial grant from the U.S. Public Health Service had recently been awarded. Furthermore, as a friend and consultant to Dr. Stuart Willis, Director of the State&#x27;s Sanatorium System, he was involved in planning a 100 bed chest-disease hospital, which would serve as headquarters for the State&#x27;s tuberculosis program but which would operate under the aegis of the Department of Medicine in the School of Medicine and be fully integrated into the clinical teaching and research programs of the School of Medicine. The Chest Disease Hospital, CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 95 which was later named the Graveley Sanatorium, was to be built on land close to the main N.C. Memorial Hospital with State funds appropriated to the Sanatorium System. However, even at this early stage, Recce&#x27;s greatest concern was to begin to identify prospects to head the main clinical departments of the School of Medicine - Surgery, Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics, Psychiatry, Radiology, Anesthesiology, Laboratory Services, etc. - who would, once appointed, need to recruit a large number of sub-specialty staff members. Collectively, this expanded body of clinicians, which would soon number, perhaps, 200 or more, would oversee patient care in the Hospital, plus extensive research activity, and perhaps of greatest importance, teaching programs for interns and residents, for medical students and, to some degree, for a wide variety of other students in Health Affairs. FW: Henry, at some point I hope we can talk about where Reece found this wide variety of men. Where they came from and how they worked into the program at Chapel Hill. Henry, you have talked about your personal relationships with Billy Carmichael, Claude Teague, and Bob House. What about Dean Berryhill? HC: My relationship with Reece was somewhat strained from the start. You will recall that Reece had been Assistant Dean of the two year school when I had been a student in 1937-39. Actually, I had very little contact with Reece during that period. I recall only two or three lectures and demonstrations at Watts Hospital during my second year of medicine during which he gave the students a limited introduction to history taking and the physical examination of patients. My main contacts with the Dean&#x27;s office during that period were with Billy MacNider. Reece became Dean in 1940, after I had transferred to Rochester. Reece was seventeen years older than I and I had the feeling that he approached our beginning relationship as one of professor to student. I expect I first gained Recce&#x27;s full attention when he learned that I had become President of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honorary Medical Society at Rochester. Later, in early 1949, as he was beginning to consider candidates to direct the new hospital in Chapel Hill he wrote me to inquire about my activities with Basil McLean and he seemed to be deeply impressed with the our Asheville and Western North Carolina Hospital study which I sent to him. Subsequently, after he got strong endorsements of my work at Vanderbilt, he invited me to come to Chapel Hill in the summer of 1949 for an interview for the Hospital Directorship here and he and Norma were very cordial hosts for Blanche and me during that visit. I declined an invitation to take that position because I felt I had an obligation to Vanderbilt to solve some of their major hospital problems before moving on. Still later, as detailed in his own History of Medical Education at Chapel Hill published in 1979, Reece was the prime advocate for the creation of the Division of Health Affairs at UNC. I think he actively supported the choice of me as its Administrator in the absence of other promising candidates. In my view, Fran, Reece was and remains something of a paradox. Reece had a commanding personality, strong qualities of leadership and strong personal convictions, mostly along quite conservative lines. He was an indefatigable worker. He was a good judge of men and looked for professional competence in his staff. He put a high value on loyalty and rewarded those who supported his views. While he had little sense of humor and few interests beyond his work and his family, he could be relaxed and charming on social occasions. His central mission in life was to establish an outstanding School of Medicine. I was soon to learn that his models were Harvard and Western Reserve, where he had trained, rather than the brave new world of the CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 96 Sanger Report. Reece was also an astute politician with an extensive &quot;Old Boy&quot; network of physicians and lay leaders around North Carolina. But I soon began to recognize that there was also a serious &quot;down side&quot; to Reece. He was obsessed by his conviction of the primacy of medicine as an academic discipline and was openly disdainful of the other Health Affairs schools as lesser sciences. This produced strained personal and professional relationships in the University &quot;family&quot;. He rarely respected points of view on complex issues which differed from his own, and often responded by simply disparaging his &quot;opponent&quot;. His ill humor on many occasions when he felt thwarted was well know, both within his faculty and beyond. He seemed to delight as times in recounting the accomplishments of the school despite his contention that it was not being supported by the University. I felt many of those accomplishments resulted, in part, from the very support which he denied. But, perhaps most important, Reece&#x27;s boldness in going outside of regular University administrative channels to achieve his ends was well known throughout the Division of Health Affairs and beyond, and this made him a hero to his inner circle of Medical School supporters. However, this was an affront to me and the Chancellor and President, and I was dismayed that the top administration made so little effort to discourage this type of activity. However, in fairness to the Chancellor and President, there were UNC Trustees and other prominent North Carolinians who were willing to listen to Reece and to support his views. Fran, I really think this type of activity by Reece was a factor in Gordon Gray&#x27;s resignation as President of UNC after a relatively short period of years in that office. FW: Can you recall any specific incidents which illustrate what you have been saying? HC: There will be some big incidents which we will discuss later on. But let me cite two from my early months in Chapel Hill. One day-I think it was during July 1950-1 was in Chancellor House&#x27;s office bringing him up-to-date. Claude Teague walked in and commented that the State auditors had noted that Reece was being paid an annual fee by the University Infirmary and questioned its propriety. House and Teague asked that I look into the matter. In the ensuing discussion I learned that both men had long found it difficult and unpleasant to deal with Reece on many issues and they recognized they were giving me a sticky assignment. Indeed, House reflected on the process of my selection as Administrator of the Division of Health Affairs saying that Reece had first been asked to take the job and he [House] had actually, at one critical point, telephoned Reece at 6:00 A.M. one morning to urge him to do so with the admonition that Reece would never be satisfied with anyone who was placed over him. I explored the situation which Teague brought up. Reece, of course, had been Director of the Student Infirmary before becoming full-time Dean in 1940. He had been retained as a part time consultant to the Infirmary staff with a stipend of $2,000 with the justification that he was the only member of the staff who had Specialty Board recognition in Internal Medicine and this was desirable for &quot;accreditation.&quot; But in the years that followed the circumstances had changed drastically. Other physicians with full Specialty Board approval had joined the Infirmary staff. And the job of Dean of the expanding school had escalated his duties there enormously. I was told there was nothing in writing about Reece&#x27;s arrangement with the Infirmary. My solution was to recommend discontinuing the $2,000 supplement from the Infirmary. However, I had become aware that Reece&#x27;s salary as Dean was only $9,500 plus some perquisites relating to housing and automobile [I think this was the same situation with the Chancellor]. I felt that this was much too low for the medical Dean in view of the responsibilities that Reece now faced, so I arranged CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 97 that Reece&#x27;s salary as Dean be raised to $12,000 with the prospect that this would increase substantially over time. House and Teague thought this was a good solution. Reece was quite displeased. Reece&#x27;s basic premise was that each of his associates was either &quot;for him or against him&quot;. In his view, I had shown my true colors and was &quot;agin him&quot;. And while the general workings of the Division of Health Affairs went forward in an expeditious fashion in the months ahead, the tension between Reece and me gradually increased from that time on. FW: Is there another example? HC: One other example. About a year or so later, after Gordon Gray had become President at UNC, House and Gray invited Reece and me to lunch at the Monogram Club. I did not know in advance the purpose of the meeting. House opened the conversation by stating that it was becoming apparent that Reece and I did not get along very well. Then he turned to me and said, &quot;Henry, don&#x27;t you trust Reece?&quot; I could hardly believe what I had heard because I knew the Chancellor himself didn&#x27;t trust Reece and he knew full well that I didn&#x27;t. After a few moments of thought I tried to rise to the occasion by saying that Reece was a hard and dedicated worker, that he had done a magnificent job in helping to prepare the way for the expansion of the School of Medicine, and that he was making steady progress toward that goal. But I added that Reece frequently did not respect people with opinions that were different from his own, that he often went on his own outside of University administrative channels to gain support to achieve his own ends and that this was unfair to the Administrator and the Chancellor and the President and disruptive, at time, to effective University functioning. FW: So what happened? HC: I was astounded by what followed. There was a long pause during which Reece took several long, deep breaths. Then he responded in a somewhat halting manner that he wanted us to know that his recent visit to Luther Hodges-then Governor of North Carolina and Chairman of the UNC Board of Trustees and I think a former college roommate of Reece-had been to seek personal advice rather than to influence University policy. I had no knowledge of Reece&#x27;s visit to the Governor, though he must have thought that I did. But he validated my main point and the discussion quickly turned to other matters. I think the net result of this incident was simply to accentuate Reece&#x27;s feeling that I was &quot;against him&quot;. FW: Let&#x27;s go on and talk a little about your start-up relations with the other programs in Health Affairs. HC: I saw a lot of John Brauer, the Dean of the new School of Dentistry, during my early work in Chapel Hill. John had come to Chapel Hill in March, three months ahead of me. He moved into an office suite in Miller Hall about the same time as I. So our paths crossed on a daily basis from then on. John had already laid some of the ground work for activating his new school by the time I arrived but these preparations continued to build, day by day, with input from me and his first three faculty members who arrived shortly after me. The activation of the school had been set for September 1950 and during the summer a class of forty first year students was recruited. Plans were developed for the first year curriculum in consultation with the heads of the three Basic Science departments concerned, and some teaching staff were being added to those departments with money appropriated to the School of Dentistry. I was told by both John Brauer and the departments heads concerned that this joint planning activity proceeded smoothly and cordially. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 98 Brauer made arrangements for two Quonset huts to be placed at the north end of the School of Medicine - one to be a temporary Anatomy Laboratory and the second a general classroom for dental students. Also, John and his new faculty began to work with architects on the design of a permanent School of Dentistry building which would become essential in September 1952 when the dental students were scheduled to begin their work with patients. The identification of prospects for positions on the clinical dental faculty moved forward, though funds to support most of them would not be available until the 1951-53 budgets became effective. John and I began to develop plans for the activation of a Dental Foundation, which would seek funds from private sources to supplement State funds in support of the school. There was a good nucleus of men to assist in this effort from among State dental leaders who had worked in behalf of the recent enabling legislation. From my standpoint, John Brauer was a joy to work with. In his history of the UNC School of Dentistry, From Quonset Hut to Number One and Beyond, Kermit Knudtzon stated that John Brauer &quot;was born on a small farm in southeastern Nebraska of parents relatively poor in material wealth but rich in the love of their children and faith in their God&quot;. John&#x27;s work ethic reflected his German heritage with its strong Lutheran focus. He had an enormous personal drive and determination to succeed in whatever course of action he pursued, and he had the ability to achieve his goals. Brauer worked his way through the University of Nebraska and its School of Dentistry. He came to Chapel Hill with experience in five schools of dentistry, his most recent position having been that of Dean of Dentistry at the University of Southern California. He had a wide acquaintance with leading dentists across the country and therefore was in a good position to recruit an able faculty. He was a disciplinarian in his relations with his faculty, but he set the pace with his own intense work schedule. I was made fully aware of this schedule one day in august 1950 when, after a sleepless night, I went to my office at 4:00 A.M. to attack a pile of papers and found John Brauer already at work revising a copy of his Dentistry for Children, which was the standard textbook in that field. While most of my contacts with John Brauer related to professional matters we also had some rewarding personal contacts. Among other things, we played golf together occasionally in Pinehurst on rare days off. Worked actively together on one Chapel Hill Community Chest campaign and shared experiences relating to his productive efforts to develop a bequest program for the Methodist Diocese of North Carolina, and my less successful efforts to stimulate the development of a similar program for the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. F W: That covers your early relations with the Deans of Medicine and Dentistry very well. In addition to developing personal relationships I suspect you also had to manage to develop an effective presentation on the budgets to the Governor and Advisor Budget Commission in early July in the absence of the top spokesmen for Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy and the Hospital. In fact, you have already eluded to that. HC: Fran, that task did not turn out to be quite as difficult as I had anticipated. The budgets for the Schools of Public Health and Pharmacy for 1950-51 would be largely continuations of those in effect for 1949-50. I obtained advice from Acting Deans John Wright and Ira Rose on the appropriate modifications. The School of Dentistry had been given a designated appropriation by the 1949 Legislature for 1950-51. This included money both to add Basic Science faculty who would be responsible for teaching dental students and to begin to recruit a few clinical Dental School faculty. Brauer developed the main Dental School budget for 1950-51, and Berryhill detailed the expanded Basic Science budget. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 99 For the beginning activation of the Hospital, the clinical departments of the School of Medicine, the School of Nursing and the expanded Division of Library the Legislature had authorized a lump sum of $300,000 for 1950-51. FW: Think of that! HC: Yes, do think of that! The annual operating budget of the Division of Health Affairs is now around $500,000,000. FW: Yes. HC: That&#x27;s 1994. FW: Yes. HC: About $30,000 of the $300,000 for 1950-51 was assigned to the Library to purchase books and another $50,000 was put into a contingency reserve to meet the most acute needs in the Division which developed during the next few months. The remaining $220,000 was made available to Berryhill, Cadmus, and Kemble to appoint a few key people to help them plan and oversee building projects, recruit staff, and in the case of the School of Nursing, begin to develop a curriculum and recruit the first class of students for a program that was tentatively set to start in September 1951. Perhaps the most important part of my presentation to the Governor and Advisory Budget Commission in July was in painting the big picture of overall program development which lay ahead for the next several years. In order to do this I developed six charts, one chart for each of the five schools and one for the N.C. Memorial Hospital. Each chart depicted developments which were projected over a seven fiscal year period from 1949-50 to 1955-56. There were vertical bars showing the projected build up of students of all types and of faculty for each year, as well as arrows showing when construction of needed facilities should start and when new buildings must be completed to allow the educational programs to proceed. For the Hospital the same type of chart was developed but the vertical bars for each year reflected projected growth in patients and service staff and the arrow indicated when various types of students were scheduled to begin work with patients. There were no budget figures presented on these charts but several messages were very clear to the State representatives in attendance. First, a very large and complex medical center was under development in Chapel Hill which would be activated over a seven year period. Second, a number of facilities must be built and put into operation on a tight schedule or else the programs each was intended to support could not operate. Third, large sums of State money would be required, over time, to promote the optimum development of each program. Fourth, the several programs were inter-related and to a considerable degree dependent on each other for their full development; so they needed to go forward in concert. And, fifth, a strong working partnership must exist between the State Administration and the University to assure that all elements of this program moved forward together and on schedule. If that occurred, the partnership between the State Administration and the University would have created a new medical center which would be of immeasurable benefit to the people of North Carolina and one in which all parties concerned could take pride. If it did not occur, then the State Administration and the University would have a huge mess on their hands and this would be clearly evident to the general public. Fran, over a forty year professional life working with a number of different universities and agencies I have observed that many workers in the ranks often attribute their own frustrations in their jobs to policies and ineptness at the top administrative levels of their organizations. In this regard, my fifteen year experience in Chapel Hill in dealing with the State CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 100 Administration in Raleigh was mostly very good. There were, of course, occasions when such things as purchasing and travel authorizations were delayed and approval of building plans were slow in coming, but, overall, David Coltrane, the head of the Budget Office, Larry &quot;Dinty&quot; Moore, his deputy, and Frank Turner, the Chief Engineer who reviewed all proposed capital improvements, were very supportive and helpful. I had the feeling that they were inattentive, at time, to relatively minor things but, on the other hand, they went to bat actively to address major problems. On numerous occasions they were heroes in my mind in gaining authorization to transfer funds from savings in one budgetary category to cover short-falls in another. I attribute much of this good relationship to the quality of the men themselves but, equally important, perhaps, was the mutual respect which they had developed with Billy Carmichael, Claude Teague, Buster Shepherd and, later, with Mac Norwood. FW: Who was Mac Norwood? HC: Mac Norwood first came to Chapel Hill in the early 1950s to serve as the Business Officer in the hospital. In 1956 he transferred to South Building as Assistant Business Manager of the University to really oversee the total business operations in Health Affairs. FW: I remember him, but I just didn&#x27;t know what his title was. HC: He was a very important person from 1956 to 1965 when he left to go to Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia where he later became Acting President of that institution. My role in working with the Budget Bureau staff and the members of the Joint Appropriation Committee of the Legislature was to explain in simple terms the objectives of the program under consideration and the steps necessary to meet those objective. I tried hard, along with other University personnel, to make each of these men feel that he was a full member of our team. My activities in preparing for the early July budget hearings had an important tangential pay-off. I prepared a report to Chancellor House discussing the status of the new Division of Health Affairs as of June 30, 1950. With Billy Carmichael&#x27;s encouragement and help, this was transformed into a printed brochure, entitled &quot;After 71 Years&quot; which described the situation in Chapel Hill 71 years after the School of Medicine was founded in 1979. This was addressed &quot;To the People of North Carolina&quot; and it was widely distributed throughout North Carolina as a progress report to everyone who had had any role in the Good Health Movement and in the subsequent legislative process. This report was also widely reported in the public press throughout North Carolina by the UNC News Bureau. That Bureau was headed by Bob Madry during my early years in Chapel Hill. Bob was a native of Scotland Neck and I developed a relaxed, warm relationship with him. I recall that the News Bureau functioned largely as a one-man operation with Bob calling on part-time help to write spot stories. Bob did not have the money to employ a permanent, full-time staff and except for Jake Wade, who served the Athletic Department and Spike Saunders, who kept in contact with the UNC alumni, the &quot;public relations&quot; program of UNC seems to have been inadequately developed during the early 1950s. One of my jobs was to inform Bob Madry about major developments in Health Affairs and to furnish data for some spot stories. Also, to help him prepare occasional &quot;spectacular&quot; stories for the Sunday newspapers. In this connection, too, I came to know Spike Saunders, the Alumni Secretary, very well and to join him on many occasions as the featured speaker at meetings of UNC alumni throughout North Carolina. All the alumni were anxious to get the latest news about football and the new Medical Center in Chapel Hill, and I talked about both. It was not until Bob CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 101 Bartholomew joined the staff of Pete Ivey at the UNC News Bureau in 1956 that the newsworthy activities in the Division of Health Affairs were reported to the media on a daily basis. FW: When did Dean Kemble and Dean Brecht and Dr. Cadmus actually begin their work in Chapel Hill? HC: Betty Kemble&#x27;s appointment as Dean of the School of Nursing was formalized in July 1950, as I recall, and she moved into a house in Dogwood Acres with Thelma Brummit, a friend from New York, about August 1. Betty indicated she was stressed out and wanted to use the month of August to get settled in Chapel Hill and take a bit of vacation. This she did except for a number of interruptions to work with the architect on finalizing the plans for the School of Nursing building and its adjoining dormitories. These plans were put out for bids in September and contracts for construction signed in October. I have already highlighted the major beginning challenges which Betty Kemble faced on her arrival. FW: What about Bob Cadmus who came in to be the Administrator of the hospital? HC Bob Cadmus came to Chapel Hill with his wife, Lorna, and two small children in late August and moved into an apartment in Glen Lennox. Bob and I had communicated frequently by telephone during the summer, mostly on matters relating to fixed equipment for the hospital and on details of construction which was in progress. Bob was highly motivated restless and energetic young man, slightly older than I, who hit the ground running on coming to Chapel Hill, leaving it to Lorna to take charge of getting the family settled. In contrast with Betty Kemble, who had had no previous experience as Dean of a School of Nursing, Bob was well prepared to take on his new position as Hospital Director. Following his graduation from Columbia University School of Medicine in 1940, Bob spent three years as a Resident in Surgery at Columbia, then another three years as Director of out-patient services at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. This was followed by two years as Assistant Director of University Hospitals, Cleveland, the main teaching hospitals of Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He understood very well the size of the task he faced. His formidable early challenges required him to oversee the construction and equipping of several facilities, including the main N.C. Memorial Hospital, and to oversee the assembly of several hundred staff members for that hospital, with no nucleus of staff on hand on which to build and no reservoir of professionally trained personnel in the Chapel Hill area from which to recruit. FW: Wow! I had never thought of that assignment. HC: He also had to develop from scratch the policies and procedures for launching a new University Hospital. Bob needed quickly to obtain one or two Assistant Directors and a Chief of Nursing Service to help him address these larger concerns. His first step, however, was to obtain an excellent Executive Secretary, Rachel Long, who served as his primary assistant for almost fifteen years. Rachel, incidentally, was niece of John Umstead. FW: I had forgotten that. John Umstead being an University Trustee and . . . HC: And a very major force in the State Legislature as well as a key University Trustee FW: Yes. HC: I am especially indebted to Rachel because she helped me find a very competent and dedicated secretary, Esther Shelton, who had been a member of Spencer Love&#x27;s staff at Burlington Industries. Esther quickly developed friendships with the main secretaries throughout the administrative hierarchy at UNC which, over time, helped greatly to implement administrative matters smoothly and effectively. Esther was my good friend and working associate for the next fifteen years. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 102 FW: Now let&#x27;s talk about Ed Brecht. HC: Ed Brecht&#x27;s promotion from Professor to Dean of the School of Pharmacy became effective, as I recall, on September 1, 1950. The Search Committee had completed its work early in the summer but its top recommendation, a man of some national stature, had salary expectations far beyond our capabilities at the time. Brecht had been the Committee&#x27;s number two choice. Brecht had been a popular and very active teacher as a faculty member. I had little doubt about his drive and ability to do a workmanlike job as Dean, but I was somewhat concerned about his imagination and creativity and willingness to move beyond traditional patterns. At that point in its history the School of Pharmacy had recently activated a small graduate program and it would award its first Ph.D. in June 1951. It needed to expand undergraduate enrollment to meets the need for retail pharmacists throughout North Carolina. In order to do that, it desperately needed new and enlarged facilities. Howell Hall, which housed that School, was located adjacent to the present Morehead Planetarium. It was not only old and too small; it was also located several blocks from the Basic Science Departments of the School of Medicine where Pharmacy students took some of their courses. This created problems for all Pharmacy students to make class connections. I was quite familiar with Blanche&#x27;s experiences as a Pharmacy student in 1937-41 in trying daily to help her roommate, who was seriously handicapped from an earlier bout with polio, to make those class connections. FW: From what you have been saying I understand that on September 1, 1950, the Deans of the five schools in the Division of Health Affairs and the Director of the Hospital were all on hand and ready to get to work full time. HC: Yes. McGavran had also returned to Chapel Hill from his summer consulting work. So, during the first week in September I called my first Division Board meeting. The Board was made up at that time of the five Deans, the Hospital Director and Dr. Robert Coker, the latter representing the main Arts and Sciences campus. This Board, with only a few changes in personnel, was destined to meet every two weeks, with few exceptions, for the next fifteen years. FW: Well, Henry, we&#x27;ve launched an exciting story and we&#x27;ll get on to more of it. Thanks a lot.</dc:description>

<dc:description>C330 GOVERNOR JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 JACK FLEER: An interview with Governor James B. Hunt of Wake Forest University and the Southern Oral History program at Chapel Hill as part of a series of interviews with North Carolina former governors. The interview was conducted on July 6th, 2001 at the office of Governor Hunt in Raleigh, North Carolina. The interviewer is Dr. Jack D. Fleer, Department of Politics, Wake Forest University. Tape number 7-06-01JBH. JF: [Here today so let&#x27;s see what happens. I&#x27;m going to turn this to you. The important thing is we get your voice on there.] Governor, when we spoke the last time, you mentioned that you went from sort of the farm team to the big leagues when you wrote a letter to Bert Bennett. I want you to talk a little bit about that, the jump from having been lieutenant governor and having a lot of support and making that decision and particularly the role of Bert Bennett in that decision. You mentioned that it was a very significant part of your political journey. JAMES HUNT: Yes. Well, of course I got to know Bert working for Terry Sanford back in 1960 and in the Preyer race in 1964. As I think I may have already said to you I found him to just be not only a fine human being in terms of all the characteristics you look for in a person but to be one of the most, one of the best students of people that I had ever met. Everybody with whom he had worked he had established a very strong personal relationship. He knew their wives and their children and their personal situation. He had this very friendly approach of being interested in other people that made him, really endeared him to people and made people want to work with him, want to help him and be very, very responsive to him. I found that he had through his work with both Sanford and Rich Preyer had developed a statewide what we called JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 organization of people that were both very good at politics and very loyal to Bert. Getting his support, not casual support but total involvement and total commitment which is the way he always did things, was I think the biggest sort of breakthrough that I had in terms of my lieutenant governor&#x27;s race and certainly my race for governor in 1976. JF: So you had contacted him earlier when you ran for lieutenant governorship. JH: That&#x27;s when I really wrote him the letter that I think I had referenced to about 1971 laying out my thoughts. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s kept the letter. I wish I had a copy of it. I&#x27;m sure I did not keep a copy of it. I was laying out my thoughts of different alternatives that I thought I might consider, and but when Bert signed on became involved in it, as I said when Bert does something, he&#x27;s totally involved. Every friend he has, every acquaintance, every business relationship he calls on to be of help. Of course all that had grown out of his relationship with Terry plus his business, his independent business relationships throughout the state where he was highly admired in the oil business and more recently in hotel and motels and restaurants and things of that sort. So anyhow I think that was my biggest single breakthrough. Getting to work with Terry Sanford and knowing him and knowing his people around the state was the first significant thing that happened in my political career, but the biggest thing that ever happened in terms of me becoming successful in getting votes and getting support was Bert&#x27;s total commitment. JF: That&#x27;s quite a compliment to him. As you think about the four races that you ran for governor-we&#x27;re not going to be talking about the other races so muchbut the four races you ran for governor, what did you see as the key components of a successful race beyond having Bennett as a friend and a supporter? 2 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 JH: Well, I think the key components were, I think I would probably mention two areas. First of all in terms of issues, having the support of supporters of education and generally progressive minded people in North Carolina was the most important thing in terms of issues. But also being perceived as somebody who was fairly moderate and middle of the road which my eastern North Carolina background sort of helped me with, my rural background, my connection with rural leaders throughout the state was helpful on. But I was clearly a progressive candidate, one who wanted to change the state, improve it, create more jobs, create more jobs statewide and understood that education at all levels was the most important thing for that. But also that infrastructure, roads and highways and bridges and later rail transportation, which we need to move to, but all those things were critically important. Getting the support of the NCAE in my race for lieutenant governor, and my first race for governor and continuing throughout my career was very important. People pay attention to teachers, who are the teachers for. Now every organization may have its detractors, but the fact is that that was a very important stamp of approval in terms of my position on education and my potential to make it better. I was careful to try to broaden my base throughout my political career while Bert Bennett and the Terry Sanford team was most important thing that I had going politically. When I ran for governor, a prominent conservative named Joe Hunt supported me very much in the conservative wing of the party. A good number of people throughout the state who had been supporters of more conservative candidates who had been active for Dan Moore and others were helpful to me. JF: Did you see that getting what you might say more conservative, and if I could say if this isn&#x27;t misstating your sort of business component of North Carolina voters in 3 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 your race, was a change in the way Democrats approached putting together majority coalitions or was that a continuation of something that was going on? JH: I think I may have paid more attention to it than a lot of other people. I think that that was true. When I mentioned a while ago two areas, one was the issues area. The other was sort of an area where people were seen as being politically ideological or whatever the term would be. But I thought that was very, very important. I naturally had some appeal to people who were more progressive in their views. This included education people. It included leaders in the minority community in North Carolina and others people in academic communities and so forth, Young Democrats who were strong statewide. But I very intentionally worked at creating a statewide organization of people of supporters building a team that by the way stayed with me through the years. Including in that team people who were urban and progressive and who you would naturally expect to have behind you. But broadening that base out so that I had the support also of a fair number of business people, and that grew of course later it was very strong. In the beginning it was not as strong. They did not know me. But rural leaders, farm organization leaders throughout the state, agriculture teachers~I was one of them agricultural extension people throughout the state. When I went to a county campaign, I would go to the county offices. I wouldn&#x27;t just shake hands with the register of deeds and clerk of courts office and the sheriffs office. I would go to the agricultural extension office and the SCS. My father was a soil conservationist, and I would go to the ASC. I had measured land [as] a young man. I knew all these people, the farm organization people were folks I knew and worked with and had strong support from. And much of this was the kind of Kerr Scott support through the years and Bob Scott of course kept 4 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 most of that. But it was that kind of a coalition that made it possible to have a broad base and of course to have very strong victories my first race for governor. I believe I won two-to-one. I was reviewing, looking at some figures the other day. I carried counties that haven&#x27;t gone Democratic since in 1976. There have been a lot of changes in demography and so forth since then. But I paid particular attention to creating a broad base that maybe didn&#x27;t completely cover the philosophical spectrum but that covered about three-fourths of it and paid great attention to people in every county and every region of North Carolina. In fact in all of my campaigns I had my first event and often times kind of a rally and fundraising event in the mountains of western North Carolina, an eastern North Carolina man starting his campaign in the West. JF: I remember from reading that in the 1992 campaign where that was a particularly significant element primarily because of I guess your principle of challenger or opponent at the state in the Democratic Party Lacy Thornburg. You ended up winning most of those counties in the west that were thought to be his space. JH: That&#x27;s right. I always paid close attention to that. In the 1996 campaign Richard [Vinroot] was running in Charlotte. He wanted to run. But I had my first big event because I went and talked to them. I had been working with the leaders in Charlotte. I had my first big event [there], and [a]big fundraising event at John Belk&#x27;s home sponsored by Hugh McColl and Ed Crutchfield and John Belk and Bill Lee and the folks who were the real sort of power leaders in Charlotte, in Mecklenburg County. Once it was clear where those people were in the campaign, it made it very hard for anybody else to be successful. I always worked at these things personally though. I was willing to go in to see people and did, made calls to them, talked to them, listened to them. I always 5 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 felt like politics was a matter of leaders and working with citizens and other leaders. These were certainly some of our best leaders and having a team, and I always gave it my personal individual attention and set up my campaigns in the same way that I later worked with them on issues. JF: I had read about in the 1992 campaign when you were going to be facing Lacy Thornburg but also Jim Gardner that you got a list of contributors to Jim Martin or your organization got a list of contributors to Jim Martin in an attempt I suppose to see who among those possible business people especially in that group might be more amenable to a Hunt candidacy instead of a Gardner candidacy. Does that mean that in the second two terms that the business component of your constituency support was a more significant part of putting together a majority coalition because of the changes that were occurring in North Carolina with the Republican Party becoming much more of a challenge for Democrats? Or had it always been? JH: Well, I hadn&#x27;t thought about it that way, Jack. I would say that that&#x27;s a politically wise thing to do very consistent with my emphasis and stress over rural North Carolina early on which of course I continued to do. But I have to say to you that this also reflected my own views of the world, my experiences eight years out of office in the private sector working in a business law firm and my clear understanding that business, that you get things done more through the actions of private entities, private individuals, businesses, churches, civic clubs, foundations, nonprofit foundations. My view of the world and how you work successfully in it changed a good bit over my first eight years and certainly in the eight years I was out of office to the point that I didn&#x27;t, it wasn&#x27;t just a matter of running for and being elected governor to head the government. I saw the 6 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 governor more as the leader of the people and the state, obviously a CEO of the government, but far more than that the leader of the people with the opportunity to be effective in partnering with business and other organizations to bring about change and progress for the state. JF: So you see it more as coming from your perception of what the role of governor is rather than the changing political dynamics in the state. JH: Yes. JF: But it is clear that from the 1970s to the 1990s there were some very major changes going on in the political dynamics in North Carolina. One of those was clearly one of the Republican Party being I think a much more serious competitor even having won the governorship three times in the state with Holshouser and twice with Martin. Other than that change what do you see as the major changes that occurred in putting together a majority coalition in North Carolina between the &#x27;70s and the &#x27;90s that you had to deal with? JH: Well, you take people as they are. The state had changed a great deal, become far more urban. Many of the increased urban population were Republicans or voted that way. But the thing that sort of crosses the lines and enables you to create a majority is the thing is the issue or issues. My push was always for more jobs, stronger economy, trying to spread those across the state. This was particularly true in &#x27;92. I&#x27;ll talk about the economic development issues and so forth and helping people understand that education and skill training were the keys to that. Now you see that how much that&#x27;s understood now with George Bush&#x27;s campaign and the strength of education issues at all levels, in every state including the national level. So I ran for governor in &#x27;92 because I 7 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 thought North Carolina had gotten off track. At one point I probably have mentioned this to you before. We were last in SAT scores and at the bottom in infant mortality. I think that was about 1990. I remember one day just having it all of a sudden, Gosh. Now we&#x27;d been low. But all of a sudden wepophit the bottom. As I looked around I found out on economic development South Carolina was eating our lunch. We had not, I mean North Carolina always will be pretty attractive to economic development, but South Carolina developed some policies that were enabling them to get industries that we just were in no position to get and did not get. So I ran for governor for reasons. I didn&#x27;t run to be governor. I might have, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever done that. But it was running for election as governor again after being out of office for eight years, having a very comfortable and rewarding life, was a decision I made because I felt so strongly about the state&#x27;s situation and the state&#x27;s potential. I felt like our progressive tradition and history had been sort of, we&#x27;d sort of gotten away from it some, and we were not making the progress in providing the opportunities for our people that we should. That&#x27;s why I ran again, and I ran with the determination that if I was elected, I was going to focus strictly on North Carolina and our possibilities. It&#x27;s easy for a governor to get involved in all the national organizations like the National Governor&#x27;s Association. I told myself if I was elected to governor again I wasn&#x27;t going to run to be chairman of any national organization. I&#x27;d do some things, but I wasn&#x27;t going to let anything get my mind off of this state. That&#x27;s why I focused so much on the schools and wrote that book as I went out laying out both the progress we&#x27;ve made and what we needed to do to get to be first in America. But I was really driven to make changes in the state and to help us achieve the potential that I was confident we had. 8 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 JF: Did you feel that this sort of getting off track was primarily because the state during those previous eight years had been run by a Republican governor or was it that the Democratic Party had lost its attachment to that sort of progressive focus that you had seen so important in the 1970s and previously? JH: Well, some good things happened certainly during the eight years that I was out of office. The Highway Trust Fund was put in for example, and there were some other issues, but the sum and substance of it was that we weren&#x27;t making the progress we should have made. I don&#x27;t think we had enough bold ideas coming from the governor&#x27;s office. I don&#x27;t think we were challenged to do the things that we needed to do both in terms of different policies and greater financial commitment to those. We were not making some of the grassroots changes we ought to make that I proposed in Smart Start. But I&#x27;m sure that the legislature was not blameless in all of that. I didn&#x27;t really run blaming anybody. I just felt like certain things needed to be done. For example we needed to see that children in those first years when their brains were developing, their motivation was developing that they got the kinds of attention and help so that they would have huge potential in their lives. We weren&#x27;t doing that. We were not stressing the importance of teaching and improving the quality of teaching for our children in the way that I thought we needed to do. We did not have programs of economic incentives that would enable us to be competitive for business and industry that I thought we should do. We weren&#x27;t doing enough in the environmental fields and some other areas. But I don&#x27;t, I felt like the leadership from the governor&#x27;s office was not adequate, but it wasn&#x27;t terrible either. I just felt like we sort of were beginning to drift, and I wanted us to have strong, aggressive jump forward in providing opportunities for our people. 9 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 JF: You mentioned the importance of issues, and you&#x27;ve talked about education and economic development in particular as two majors themes, environment being a third one. One of the issues that was very important to you at least as you campaigned and as you governed in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s was crime. You, if I remember correctly, gave a special message to every General Assembly on crime every two years I suppose throughout that entire period. Was that, can you tell me why that was such a big issue to you, why you invested the kind of time and effort that you did? JH: Because it&#x27;s an issue that matters to people. It&#x27;s not a philosophical situation, something that people feel and they know about.   In my own life I&#x27;ve had an elderly cousin brutally murdered in the last month. The mother who was kidnapped and killed as she was changing her baby at a CVS Pharmacy within fifty miles of my home this past weekend. People see those things. It has touched everybody, and they want us to do something to reduce crime and protect them and their families. Politics should be about helping people in their lives. The kinds of things they think about and worry about and talk about. How their children are going to do is one of those. What their job is going to be like is one. Whether or not this air out here is going to make their kids or elderly parents sick is one. But whether or not they&#x27;re safe in their communities in one. It&#x27;s an issue; I&#x27;m glad you brought it up. I don&#x27;t know whether we talked about it before or not. It&#x27;s an issue that I felt strongly about, that I started giving leadership to as lieutenant governor when I created the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Commission on Law and Order or whatever it was. I forget the exact name. I created the cabinet Department on Crime Control and Public Safety in my first term as governor. I did give those special messages. I proposed to the legislature that we re-establish the death penalty for first degree murder. 10 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 In my second term I had a special session of the legislature on juvenile crime and or crime generally I guess it was but with a special thrust there on reducing juvenile crime. Later I created the department that your friend the police chief (George Sweat) came down. He headed up, and I&#x27;ve got to remember what we call it, Jack. JF: Juvenile Justice. JH: Juvenile Justice. That&#x27;s right. So in both of my terms I gave leadership to change the organization of government to focus more on crime and protecting our people. I feel very, very strongly about that. I&#x27;ve been criticized by a lot of liberals because of my position on crime. It was very, very hard to get through my bills, but I eventually passed I think thirty-four out of thirty-six bills in the special crime session in 1994. We almost had a rift in the Democratic Party between me and the house leadership because I was pushing so hard to pass those bills. But I&#x27;m convinced it was the right thing to do. The people were certainly strongly behind it. I think we&#x27;re safer today because of it. JF: Regrettably some people certainly in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s saw anti-crime as having a racial component to it. I say regrettably that&#x27;s what happened. With the Democratic Party and you in particular as a leader in the Democratic Party having so much strength among primarily African Americans as far as the racial group during that period now Hispanics for sure. Is that part of the resistance that you saw in the &#x27;90s or maybe even in the &#x27;70s or early &#x27;80s that you&#x27;re emphasizing crime as an issue? JH: Yes. I think so. I understand it. But the fact is racial minorities are the main victims of crime. Every survey that anybody ever does shows that support for anti-crime programs is just as strong in the minority community as it is in the non-minority community. I think that&#x27;s why although many minority leaders got real nervous about 11 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 my position on some of these issues. Some of them did not support my efforts in the special crime session. The minority population in the state I don&#x27;t think ever questioned or was concerned about it. You had, I think the leaders were in this case out of step with the people. But when you have a high percentage of the population, relatively high percentage of the population being involved in crime and being punished and being in prisons, I understand why people are concerned about that and want to do something about it. That&#x27;s why I made such a major part of my focus not just punishing crime but trying to help young people avoid crime and become the kind of citizens that don&#x27;t engage in it and don&#x27;t become criminals. I think that&#x27;s over the time the only approach that will work and will protect us all. JF: Part of it I guess the education issue certainly feeds into that. JH: Oh yes. Primarily education is the primary thing you could do. If you view it broadly, and that&#x27;s why starting very early you have to help children not only develop their minds but develop their morals, develop their values and so forth. Then of course that continues to be important in the schools once they start to school, to kindergarten and on through the twelfth grade. But I think that this concern about personal safety is one that the great, great majority of the people and you can put them all together share, and it&#x27;s one that I personally felt strongly about and that the Democratic Party ought to give attention to and support. Frankly in places and times the Democratic Party has been hurt badly because people thought that they were not sensitive to the crime issue and that continues today in terms of how people vote on judges in North Carolina in my view. JF: One issue that we haven&#x27;t dealt with but really has amazing consequences for the office of the governorship is the succession issue. If you would I&#x27;d like to spend a 12 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 little time talking about your decision in the 1970s to go for succession. I think if I recall correctly you had proposed both succession and the veto. But ultimately you decided to go with the succession. Can you say, can you talk some about why it was that you made that choice at that particular time? JH: Well, in serving as governor I looked around. I was constantly meeting with governors around the country and being involved in education organizations and economic development activities. It just became very clear to me that the state had greater opportunities to make progress in jobs, education, environment, the safety of families, if a governor. Assuming the people chose, it&#x27;s always a decision of the people if there was an opportunity for more continuity, not so much starting and stopping. But if you could have the possibility to continue some policies and push and drive for eight years instead of just four. It was a very pragmatic, practical kind of consideration. When I ran for governor, I didn&#x27;t intend to. I supported it philosophically, but it was not a major thing that I ran on. I didn&#x27;t realize when I first ran for governor how important I later thought it was. As I worked as governor I came to understand what a big change it could be and how much it could help North Carolina rise up in the ranks and be more successful, and that&#x27;s why I supported it. I ultimately decided to not exclude myself from it for another practical reason, which was I became convinced that it was the best way to get it through. Have we talked about this issue before? JF: No, we haven&#x27;t. I wanted to point that out in particular because every governor prior to you for decades had supported it JH: Had supported it, and they&#x27;d always excluded themselves. JF: Yes. 13 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 JH: They always said, &#x27;I want to make it very clear this is not for me personally. So leave me out of it.&#x27; I thought about that. I looked at that. I learned about what had happened, and I just concluded, &#x27;Hey, the chances are better of getting it through if you don&#x27;t exclude yourself than if you do.&#x27; So I made the pragmatic decision not to exclude myself. JF: Can you elaborate a little bit on what you think those chances were in a sense that are you saying that politically that gave you as a proponent of this greater strength, made the legislature more receptive? I&#x27;m kind of interested in, sort of almost intuitive would be that it might hurt you because it benefits you. People say well it&#x27;s a good idea, but we&#x27;re not going to do it for you because it&#x27;s a self-interest kind of. JH: I thought about that. I looked at that argument. I looked at what happened over the years and I found out that that was fallacious. That was not the way it worked. I had a lot of support in the legislature. The programs I had run on were strongly supported. By the way I&#x27;m sure so glad you brought up this whole crime issue because it&#x27;s one of the four or five, three or four main things I ran on. It turns out that to the extent that people supported the themes that I had run on and that I supported they wanted, they weren&#x27;t all bothered about the fact that you might succeed yourself. That&#x27;s an inside baseball thing that the politicians talk about many of whom want to run for governor. JF: Right and many of them were in the legislature. JH: Yeah, the people out there thought well shoot we&#x27;ll make that decision ultimately but you ought not to be excluded from it. So I thought that the chances of getting the votes in the legislature were better if I did not exclude myself, and I thought 14 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 that my chances of getting it passed in a referendum in a constitutional referendum which turned out to be very close as you know was better. JF: Yes, it was extraordinarily close. JH: It turned out we were right. JF: Now in the choice between succession JH: Let me also say to you as I may have said this to you earlier. I genuinely at that time had not decided whether or not I&#x27;d run again. I ultimately did, but I made that decision one-year out before I ran again in 1980. JF: In the choice between succession and the veto, why succession and not the veto? JH: I concluded you couldn&#x27;t get both, and the succession was more important. JF: Do you mean more important in the sense that in the long-term history of the office of the governorship it&#x27;s more critical component. JH: That&#x27;s right. JF: The fascinating thing about the succession is it not only became critically important to the office of the governor but to so many other offices in the legislature where you now have extended leadership in the legislature. Not for every one of them but for many of them. It&#x27;s now common to be speaker of the house for two terms. The President Pro-Tern Basnight, majority leader in the senate, his fourth term. JH: But that might have happened anyway. Just look down at South Carolina at how long some of their speakers and Georgia. Go around the country and you can see particularly in the South speakers and president pro-tems who had served ten, fifteen twenty, thirty years, and of course that&#x27;s much longer than eight years. And we had 15 JAMES B. HUNT JULY 6, 2001 council of state members that (). So I do not think that the longer terms for legislative positions have necessarily come about because we had a governor who can be re-elected once. That probably has contributed to somewhat, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily the reason. I think it might have happened in any event. JF: That&#x27;s interesting because all of these traditions sort of work out of a political culture that exists in a particular state and the culture in this state was that you had turnover in political leadership in the executive positions and in the legislative positions. It&#x27;s an interesting perspective on that. If you look at the powers of the office of the governor, appointment, budget, veto, succession just to name four of them. Would it be your judgement that succession is the most important of those four? JH: Well, I don&#x27;t think you even mentioned the most important to a governor and that is public leadership, public education, the bully pulpit. That&#x27;s the most important power of the governor. Then I would say appointment (approval) of the budget, the legislative program in the budget would be the next most important. I&#x27;d say the budget and the legislative program, then appointments other appointments that you make in your team and other boards and commissions and so forth. I think veto is the last one, and succession I think would come in there. But these other things have to do with what you&#x27;re about because I believe the issues are END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A Transcribed by L. Altizer, November 1, 2001 16</dc:description>

H0B600D DATE OF INTERVIEW:  2-12-92 PLACE:  LOUISBURG, NC INTERVIEWER:  SONYA WALL NAFTALIN TAPE 1, SIDE A SONYA W. NAFTALIN:  To begin our discussion, I would like to talk some about your mother and father. JUDGE HAMILTON H. HOBGOOD:  All right. SN:  Herbert Hamilton and then Ruth Harris (Hobgood) was your mother? HH:  Yes. SN:  Okay. HH:  Do you want me to talk some about them? SN:  Please, tell me what you remember about both of them, their good qualities and what... HH:  All right, I was born and reared early in the rural community called Mapleville.  Yeah, yeah.  My father was a rural mail carrier, the only one in that area of the county.  He had a stretch of about 35 miles that he went every day. And it was a good thing for him because it was a good income for him. And my mother was a housekeeper.  She had taught for years before my father married her, back when she was young.  Back in those days, course around 1900, she didn&#x27;t get a lot of education before she taught because they just didn&#x27;t have it.  She went to Louisburg College one year.  Louisburg College is right up on the hill from here.  And we will go by temporarily and see it, before you leave. And my father did a little farming on the side.  He usually had one tenant.  He usually had one colored man and his family as a tenant all those years.  Then they moved the post office from Mapleville to Bunn, which has developed as a little community, south of here. And that cut out that part of my work. And I went over there and I went to high school in Bunn.  We lived there.  And in my family my father was married twice.  He had a boy, started with, much older than I was.  And he lived up 1 in Northern Virginia most of the time. And he was, he worked up there, his wife died, he married again. My sister was older than I was.  She graduated at two or three places.  Columbia University, as a matter of fact, was where she got her [degree], and she had quite a brilliant career, a brilliant person.  She was considered the number one brilliant person in her area in the United States. And she had gone very high.  She was a teacher at Wellesley College, which is one of the better women&#x27;s colleges in the United States. And she was, as I said, twelve years older than I was. And we had the misfortune, my father died, while I was an undergraduate at Carolina [UNC-Chapel Hill].  And my mother went up and lived with my sister in Massachusetts. And I was at Carolina, a footloose and fancy free boy, I was the head of the dining hall group.  And I was doing all right, making good pay there for myself.  And I got along fine.  And then, of course, when these other things happened to me rather quickly in my family, I had to give up on that after one year of law school, five years at Carolina, and come back here and go to work.  I worked for Pruitt Lumber Company and I worked hard, made good pay there.  And my mother, of course, came back and lived for a short time.  Then in the meantime, I started going with my present wife.  And she had, she was there, with her parents at a place called Cedar Rock, right near here. And she taught school. And she had taught down East before she had come back here.  I wanted to get married but I couldn&#x27;t marry her with my family in the situation that it was.  My mother died and then I did marry her. And we have lived together a long time since then. We have three children.  Betty, girl who graduated two or three places.  And Bob, who is now the judge, not the county judge, the district judge, the district of five counties. And he goes about the state. And Charlie, Charles, who is one of the assistant attorneys for the attorney general&#x27;s staff in Raleigh. He&#x27;s married, has a wife and two children.  So it&#x27;s pretty well situated, the family situation.  I left regular work as a judge way back when I became a lawyer, way back years ago.  Like 2 thirty-five, forty years ago.  And from your standpoint, a long time. And then I stayed with that as a senior judge for a long time. And then I retired and my son, who&#x27;s a lawyer, Bob, then he applied for my job and got it. And he&#x27;s been a judge, a judge now for eleven years. And during this eleven years, I have worked more up on call, when they wanted me for different places. And they had a right many lawyers that I knew, and a lot of lawyers liked to call me to help them.  So I worked right a long time till a year ago, then I decided I wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. As I became seventy years old, it was time for me to call it quits. But it&#x27;s not that easy. SN:  Not that easy to say &quot;no&quot; to people? HH: To quit, that&#x27;s right. And I worked slightly part-time, here and there. But try to make it as little as I can. And I still enjoy doing my work. SN:  So you still do occasionally, do some work? HH:  Occasionally. SN:  If I could just ask, it seems like you and your children and your parents too, have been in education, lawyers, judges, more or less public servants.  Do you think that is a philosophy that you had growing up from seeing the values that your parents had? What can you attribute that to? HH: Well, it was about the best think you could have in a small county where you had places you had to live on account of a family situation. And I suppose that had as much to do with it as anything. If you wanted the top job in your county, you had to be a judge, a lawyer, or something like that, and still stay there. And you see how I have lived here all these years, and I&#x27;ve been all over the state working.  But it all came back here. SN:  Right.  Did you originally start in education when you were at UNC? HH: Well, yeah. SN:  You thought about that? HH:  AB in Education is my degree, at the University of North Carolina.  And my job then was going to be, that I was 3 going out and teach for two or three years after I got through with my education and then come back to get my law degree.  But it didn&#x27;t work out that way because of the family situation.  My father had died, my mother was disabled, my sister, as I have said, was one brilliant person, up at Wellesley, she&#x27;d gone all to pieces.  She lived several years as a disabled, mentally disabled person, to a great extent. SN:  Was your mother still with her during that period? HH: Yeah, my mother was with her. And, of course, that put me as the one that had to make the money. SN:  Right, you were in charge of the family once your father had passed away. HH:  Yeah, I had to just do that.  That&#x27;s what I did. SN: And at what point did your mom come back to this area? HH:  Here? SN:  Right.  Do you remember? HH:  Yeah, came back here when I had, soon after I had dropped out of school at Carolina.  Cause she had to in 1933, or 4, somewhere along in there. And she stayed here and we lived together.  And, of course, I wanted to get married too, but I couldn&#x27;t get married but I couldn&#x27;t financially.  So I waited; when my mother died, then my sister was put in an institution. Then I married. SN:  Okay, at that point, you weren&#x27;t financially supporting someone else, you weren&#x27;t still supporting your mother. HH SN HH SN are here? HH:  Ten miles That&#x27;s right. Did you graduate from Bunn High School? Yeah. Is that right? How many miles is Bunn from where we SN:  Ten miles.  Okay.  So you grew up in Mapleville and then Bunn, once your father moved there. HH:  Yes. 4 SN: Do you have any memories of growing up? Did you have a happy childhood? How do you remember it? HH:  Oh, yes, pretty, pretty happy.  I was, of course, times back then were very financially tight for most everybody.  But I worked and made money. I managed, we had farms all around us I could work on.  People&#x27;.d hire you by the week or day. During high school? Yeah. During that period? And also had stores.  I worked in a store on Saturday SN: HH: SN: HH: for years back in those days. SN: Was this a store your family owned or other families? HH:  No, no, the merchants in town.  I worked in one or two stores.  And my people were never in that type of business.  I was in it working, but I mean I wasn&#x27;t in it as part of a family business, or anything. And so.. SN:  What was your mother like? What do you remember about her? HH:  She was a very strong willed person and my father died earlier and he was busy as a mail carrier and farmer and I didn&#x27;t see as much of him as I would my mother. SN:  Right. HH:  Cause she stayed there, she was strong willed person. And she was, I&#x27;d been going with these various girls.  She&#x27;d shake her head and things like that. SN:  She&#x27;d let you know then how she felt about things. HH:  Then, when I started going with the girl I married, this one here, she said, &quot;You have done the right thing.&quot; SN:  She gave you her approval. HH:  Yeah.  Not that that was the reason I married her. SN:  Right. HH:  But I didn&#x27;t marry her until my mother died because I couldn&#x27;t.  I had to support my mamma and myself and help on other things too. SN:  When did you meet Margaret (Stallings)? HH:  Well, I had known her, I&#x27;ll put it this way.  I had known who she was and her family, since I was a boy, but I didn&#x27;t really get to know her until I was a student at Carolina.  And she came up there.  She went to Woman&#x27;s College in Greensboro. And when she and a group of girls came up there one day when I was a student at Carolina, it was my job to take them on the campus.  I was a senior, I was president of the student body as a matter of fact that year. SN:  That was a nice job to get to show all these women around, wasn&#x27;t it? HH:  That&#x27;s right.  So I showed them around and I started going with her a little as time permitted.  Of course, if you were working, you didn&#x27;t get much time to go around. SN:  Right. HH:  But then I wanted to marry her, but she had her father and mother and I had my mother and my mother was pretty much disabled at that time.  And so, and some things I had to do with money for my sister.  So I went on and married Margaret just as soon as my mother died. SN:  I would like to ask you to, some about your years at UNC.  I know you were president of the senior class.  President of the summer session, the student council.  Is that right? HH:  Yeah. SN:  And then I also found that you were involved in some debating teams.  Is that right? Tell me about that. HH:  Oh yes.  I did more debating than anybody else there. We talked, or I would go up to Washington D.C. and talk to one of the schools up there, the university. SN:  Oh, you&#x27;d debate teams from other schools? HH:  Oh yes. And Richmond, University of Virginia, well part of it, in that school.  And then to South Carolina, Georgia, State (N.C. State University), Wake Forest, and Duke.  We&#x27;d debate them all the time. SN:  How many were on your team? Four or five? HH:  There was usually, we had about four. 6 SN:  Did you enjoy that? HH:  Oh yeah, we enjoyed that very much. We had the Democrats and the Republicans.  I was a Democrat and John Wilkerson, who is a very well known lawyer down in eastern North Carolina now who is my age, he was a Republican and we used to have some fiery debates. SN HH SN HH friends SN HH SN HH SN Now was he on your team? Was he on your debating team? No, we were opposed to each other. On opposing teams, okay. And we&#x27;d have fiery debates.  We were very good I bet that was interesting. It was very interesting. And you&#x27;ve won a medal for your debating team? A number of medals. And different honors, okay.  Mary D. Wright medal, I think that must have been a debating team honor. HH SN HH years. SN there? HH SN HH SN HH SN HH SN Yeah, that was the main one. Did you get that your senior year? Yeah.  I think I did.  I can&#x27;t remember all those Did you do the debating team the four years you were Yeah. So you started in from the beginning. Yeah. Young Democrats, I know that you were active in that? Yeah, I was president of the Young Democrats. Were you really? Yeah. Did you enjoy that? Did you meet, I&#x27;m sure you met lots of people. HH:  Oh yeah, very much.  I was considered, we had John Wilkerson as President of the Young Republicans. SN:  Was he really? HH:  Yeah. SN:  So you two ran into each other a lot.  I&#x27;m sure you had a lot of contact. Do you still see people you were friends with in Young Democrats or from UNC? Are you still friends with those people? HH:  I saw John, he was in my court about two months ago. SN:  Was he really? HH:  Yeah. SN:  So those friendships go back a long ways. HH:  Oh yeah, long ways.  They&#x27;re my old friends. SN:  You mentioned you worked in the dining hall? HH: Yes, I was the head of the dining hall.  I was the student head of it. SN HH SN HH salary. SN HH SN HH SN HH Was that to help finance your undergraduate education? Sure, I couldn&#x27;t live without that. Right. Cause I made not only my lunch, but I was paid a little So then you had spending money, too. Spending money, sure. Were your parents able to help finance your education? Well, my father died before that. Right. And my mother was not able at all.  I was supporting her some at the same time I was in school at Carolina. SN: Had you always planned to go to college? Was that a value that your parents had? To send you to college? How did that come about? HH:  Rather unusual.  My brother, my half-brother, was about fifteen years older than I was.  And he went to Carolina and spent a lot of money, and was very upsetting to my father.  I was much younger, I was, you know, very much, fifteen years&#x27; difference.  And when I got ready to go to college, my mother and father said, you can&#x27;t go to Carolina because I had one disaster there, and I&#x27;m not going to spend any money any more.  And I said I don&#x27;t want you to spend a dime. SN:  Did you really? HH:  And I&#x27;m going to Carolina.  And he didn&#x27;t spend a dime. SN:  You did it yourself. HH:  He died not too many length of time after that.  But I paid my way through Carolina, and worked all four years. SN:  Did you really?  Now had you been down to Carolina to visit before you started as a freshman? Did you have friends there? HH:  Yeah, in high school I went there and talked in the debating teams. SN:  Oh, I see.  So you had experience with that before you even started in. HH:  Yeah. SN:  So you must have, in your trips to Carolina, you must have really liked it and decided early on, that&#x27;s where you were going to go. HH: Oh, yeah, yes I did.  Yeah, I was a high school student then. SN:  And you already had that plan in your mind. HH:  Yeah. SN: Now your sister is how much, she&#x27;s twelve years older? HH:  She&#x27;s, yeah, twelve years older. SN:  Okay, she attended Columbia University? HH:  Yeah. SN:  Okay, and then ended up teaching at Wellesley? HH:  Wellesley, yeah.  Then she taught in other colleges besides that.  She taught several years in Texas. SN:  Oh did she? So she had a distinguished career herself. HH:  Very distinguished career. SN:  After you attended the one year and two months of law school at UNC, then you had to come back to Louisburg and work in Pruitt Lumber Company? 9 HH: Well, that&#x27;s the main job I had for all these several years.  About six years. SN:  So you stayed in Chapel Hill for five years and then came back to Louisburg? HH:  Yeah. SN:  And your mother was back here and living with you at that point. HH:  Yeah, she was living with me. SN: Tell me again, please, how you started taking classes at Wake Forest at night. HH:  I started to doing that.  Well, I came back here and I wanted to, I had already previously worked over a year in Carolina in law school.  And I wanted to keep up with it and so I went to the dean of the Wake Forest Law School, a fine gentlemen, which, you know, was not far from here. SN:  Right. HH:  It&#x27;s about sixteen or seventeen miles from here.  He allowed me to come over there to night law school, which I paid for, a fee.  But I went over there and I didn&#x27;t take a lot of stuff.  I didn&#x27;t have time to it.  But I&#x27;d take one course at a time, you know.  It took me quite a while over there.  And I got my law degree over there.  He was a very fine man.  And he retired himself and I think he&#x27;d rather thought I&#x27;d done pretty good to keep going. SN:  And still work, HH:  And still work. SN: Were there others in the night programs, taking night classes there at the same time? HH: Yeah, others like me.  That was back in Depression days.  Early thirties. SN: And were you already on the bench in Franklin County? How did you get that position? HH: Yeah. How did I get on the bench in Franklin County? Well, I had, of course, studied right much, and so too, the man who was the county judge, county recorder&#x27;s court judge, retired, 10 he was getting very old.  Two lawyers appeared for the job, one lawyer and one county clerk. So they were fifty, sixty years old. I was a young fellow then.  So I just ran against them and beat both of them. SN:  Who inspired you to try and run to get that position? HH:  I inspired myself. SN:  You did yourself. And so at that point, you had the one year at UNC and were taking night classes at Wake Forest. HH:  Yeah. SN:  Then you became certified to be an attorney in 1940. Is that right? HH:  That sounds right. SN:  I have that you graduated with your AB in Education from UNC at 1932.  HH:  Yeah. SN:  Then attended a year and two months UNC law school and then came back in 1933, &#x27;34, worked in the lumber business. HH:  Yeah.  Didn&#x27;t immediately go to studying law because I had to come up with a little money. SN:  Oh, did you come back here and work, or did you work at Chapel Hill? HH:  Yeah, I worked here.  I lived here, in this county. And I worked here in this county.  But you just don&#x27;t go like to law school.  You go to develop some money, or get it from your family. SN:  Have to finance it somehow, right. HH:  So it was two or three years before I went back to law. SN:  And that was at UNC, you went back. HH:  No, I didn&#x27;t go back there.  I went to law school at Wake Forest, night law school. SN:  Okay, from when you graduated in 1932, did you go straight into the year at UNC law school? HH:  Oh, I&#x27;d already gone to law school there.   That was before I ever got back here.  I had a year at Carolina so I was back here in &#x27;33. 11 SN:  &#x27;33, and then you worked and started taking the night classes.  Okay.  So you were certified in 1940, to be an attorney.  And then you actually graduated from Wake Forest College of Law in 1941.  Is that correct? HH:  That&#x27;s about right.  Cause I had several years I didn&#x27;t have the ability to go back to law school.  I had to see, my mother I was supporting, myself, and other things I couldn&#x27;t.  I had to work a while. SN:  Okay, were you working at the lumber company or doing other odd jobs? HH:  I worked at the lumber company.  They would give me as much work as I could stand. SN:  Did you work weekends too or just mainly during the week? HH SN HH SN Some. Did you really? I worked some weekends. And do you remember what your night schedule was? HH SN HH SN HH Would you go basically one night a week to take the one class? Yeah, one night a week. Then you went into the Marine Corps.  Is that right? Um-hmm.  World War Two had come on. Okay, tell me some about that. Well, I wanted very badly to be a part of the American forces in that war, and of course other people were.  But I had to have a job that I could get some money out of.  So if you volunteer and could make it in the Marine Corps, you can get paid for your time you were in school, the time you were going through that.  And so I was working, I&#x27;d already studied a little down here, we&#x27;d had a little county court, you know, and stuff for training people in, going in.  So I got in the Marine Corps and I had, I got in that with a year, I believe it was.  And at Quantico, which is right out of Washington D.C, and worked in Washington some too.  And so Quantico was the Marine Corps headquarters, and I went to school there. 12 SN:  What were you studying? HH:  I studied being, I mean I studied not in law school work, studied to be in the court system.  I don&#x27;t mean the court system, I mean the Marine Corps system. SN:  So you were studying more about government things? HH: No, I was studying about how to be a soldier, see I was a Marine. SN:  Oh, I see. HH:  Studied how to be a Marine.  See you didn&#x27;t just jump in there, you had to study.  And I was working in the Marine Corps at the same time. SN:  So you were working and studying? Did your college education, did that help you go in with a better rank? HH:  Very much. SN:  It did.  Okay.  So what did you go in as, when you entered the Marines? HH:  Went in as, well, just a plain member of the Marine Corps. SN:  Okay. HH:  Then I studied to be in the Marine Corps. SN:  I have that at the end you attained the rank of major. Is that right? HH:  Yeah. SN:  Okay. HH: We started out as, SN:  Lieutenant? Didn&#x27;t you start out? HH:  Oh yeah, lieutenant, first lieutenant. SN:  Okay, first lieutenant.  And eventually became, studied and worked enough to become, at the end of your career there, a major. HH:  Yeah, part of the time, of course, I was in the Pacific, you understand.  All of that didn&#x27;t just happen there. SN HH SN Right. I was there for a while and I went on in the Pacific How long were you in the Pacific? 13 HH: Well, that&#x27;s a different place, there&#x27;s so much. I went there and I was down on the East Coast, here, you know, right on the coast. Then I was on the West Coast for quite a while, a year. Then I went out to Ewa (Marine Base) which was a big Marine station there, out in the ocean. And I went on to Hawaii. I was there longer than any other place in the whole thing.  Cause I went from there out, got out. SN:  I&#x27;ve been there.  That&#x27;s a beautiful place.  Did you like it when you were there? HH:  Yeah, very much.  Yes sir.  That&#x27;s some of the most wonderful times in my life as a warrior. SN:  That&#x27;s a pretty place. HH:  I was single, you understand.  I didn&#x27;t have, you didn&#x27;t get to see any girls much, but __ SN:  But you had some good times. HH:  Had some good times. SN:   So you were stationed there, and you would go out and return back to your base there. HH:  Yeah. SN:  I bet that was nice. HH: Was.  Some times of the year.  But most of the time, about sixty days. SN: Now I have that 1946 was when you finished your career in the Marines. HH:  Probably, I&#x27;ve done so many things. Did so many things.  Sounds about right. SN:  Now did you marry your wife Margaret (Stallings) during that time? HH:  Yeah, well, I married my, that&#x27;s right. SN:  I have 1943, I think, May 15th. HH:  Yeah, that&#x27;s right.  Married her just as soon as I could.  My mother died, and about a month after she died I married Margaret. SN:  So you two had been planning to marry.  You were waiting for the right conditions to get married. 14 HH:  She had parents too that needed her help. SN: Now, she had been to Woman&#x27;s College in Greensboro. Is that right? HH:  Yeah. SN: And was she a teacher or a guidance counselor? HH:  Teacher, teacher. SN:  Teacher, okay. Did she continue to work right after you two married? HH:  Yeah.  Until I, well, not too long, cause the child, the oldest child was born... SN:  Betty. HH:  Betty was born, I&#x27;d have to figure it out, but I believe Betty was, I&#x27;d have to think about it, but I believe Betty was born within a year. Do you have when she was born? SN:  I don&#x27;t have that written down. HH:  I don&#x27;t think she, I think she was born about a year after we were married. SN:  Did your wife stay home at that point with the children or did she work some too? HH:  Yeah, stayed at home. SN:  She did, okay.  I have that also as part of your career your served in the State Senate.  Is that right? HH:  Yeah. SN:  What motivated you to do that? HH:  If you go to the legislature, you can go to the Senate or the House.  In the House, there are much more people who go there, and it is harder to go to the Senate.  I decided I&#x27;d just take a chance and go to the Senate.  And, of course, you got to go there by election and of course I ran for the Senate and got elected and went there for a two-year session.  I don&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re there for two years, but it&#x27;s two years elected. And, I forgot ... what did I go, two sessions? SN:  Right, two terms you were there.  What was that like? I&#x27;ve always wondered what it&#x27;s like to run for public office. What is it like? 15 HH: See, I had done that as a student at Carolina, I had run for office. SN:  Right, so you were used to that. HH: So I was used to it and the people here in this area didn&#x27;t know that this young whippersnapper was used to it, you know, but I went to work and got elected. SN:  Did you get a close friend to be your campaign manager? HH:  No, I didn&#x27;t have any money. SN:  Oh, you did your own. HH:  I did my own. SN:  Did you basically go out and just meet people? HH:  Yeah. SN:  Did you go to their houses? HH:  Sure, went anywhere where a voter was. SN:  Right. HH:  Took quite a while too. SN:  Did your wife do any of that with you? HH:  No, she was busy at home with the children. SN  Was it expensive even then? HH:  Well, not like it is now. SN:  Cause you didn&#x27;t do any of the TV ads and those sort of things back then. HH:  No. SN:  And I guess you were used to that too.  You had run for the position of judge so you had that in your career experience. HH:  Well, yeah.  That came in later. SN:  Okay. And, let&#x27;s see.  I have that you served two terms in the State Senate and you were Franklin County Attorney and Solicitor.  Now, what point in your career did you hold those two positions? HH:  Well, I was County Attorney all the time, from the time I got to be an attorney, regardless of whether I was a judge or a solicitor or whatnot.  You had the standing of an attorney, you didn&#x27;t do the attorney&#x27;s work then.  But you were an attorney and so I got that early on. 16 SN:  Okay. HH: And as a, I believe I was a District Solicitor just one year I think it was.  See, you understand I&#x27;m eighty now. SN HH SN right? HH: SN: Are you eighty? All this was back yonder. I have that you were born March 23, 1911 Is that Yeah. Okay. In 1955 then, that was when you were first appointed to the bench as a Superior Judge of the Ninth District. HH:  How old was I then, 55 from 11? SN:  Let&#x27;s see... HH:  44. SN:  Yeah, does that sound about right? HH:  That&#x27;s about right. SN:  Okay.  Now, I have one of the newspapers that published that you were paid $11,000 a year plus lunch in 1955.  I guess that was the first year. HH:  Sounded about right. SN:  Was that a good amount of money, a reasonable amount for that time? HH:  Yes, for that time it was. SN: And then it said you got money for expenses.  I guess that was for your travel, was it? HH:  Yeah. SN:  So did you do a lot of travelling? HH:  Had 5 counties when I was a judge. SN:  And did you have a set routine that you would visit those counties? HH:  Yeah.  Yes, I had to.  People would come.  Cases would come.  Franklin was this county.  Then Warren was Warrenton, right across from us here and then Vance County was Henderson and then Granville County was the next on up there, whatever that county seat is and then on up one more is Roxboro which was the other county. 17 SN:  And your son has those same five counties now, right? HH:  Yeah. SN:  So he travels. HH:  He&#x27;s got two judges though.  Him and Hight came in later (Judge Henry W. Hight, Jr.).  He went on as one judge but now he&#x27;s been in, I believe 11 years, so now they have two judges because there is too much work for one judge. SN:  Was it a heavy caseload when you, do you remember ever feeling overworked? HH: No, it didn&#x27;t ever bother me too much. SN:  It was manageable.  You could handle it. HH:  Yeah. SN:  Did you ever have to spend time on weekends? HH:  Yes. SN:  You did. HH:  On other things you mean, about the law? SN:  Right.  Reading the cases. HH:  Sure. . SN:  Let&#x27;s see, I have that you have been a Trustee at Louisburg College, is that right? HH:  Yeah, for quite a while. SN:  For a number of years. And let&#x27;s see, did your mother attend Louisburg for one year? HH:  My mother attended Louisburg College, yes. SN:  That was before she became a teacher? HH:  Oh, that was a long time ago. SN:  Was it? HH:  That was back about 1895 or something like that. SN:  Wow!  And after she attended Louisburg, then she taught school for a while? HH:  Yeah.  Then met my father and got married. SN:  And then was a homemaker from that point on. HH:  Yeah. SN:  Now, your children are Betty, Bob and then Charlie? 18 HH:  There is Elizabeth (Elizabeth H. Eidenier), and Bob is Robert (Robert H.), and Charlie is Charles (Charles H.). SN HH SN HH Okay.  Elizabeth is a teacher, is that right? Yeah. Does she still teach? Yeah, she lives in Hillsborough and she teaches up there. SN:  She also went to Woman&#x27;s College? HH:  Yeah. SN: And Charles is an Assistant Attorney with the Attorney General&#x27;s office? HH:  Attorney General&#x27;s Office - one of, there is not just one Assistant Attorney.  At one time way back I worked in there a little bit and there was just one or two assistants in the whole state. Now you&#x27;ve got a hundred. SN HH SN HH SN HH Wow, lots.  Is he the youngest son then, Charles? Yeah. Does he seem to enjoy his work? Seems to. Does he really? Yeah.  I don&#x27;t see him that much but he seems to enjoy it. SN:  So Robert must live here in Louisburg? HH:  Yeah.  He&#x27;ll be over here for lunch in a few minutes. SN:  Okay. HH:  He just happens, he has, he works all over the state for that matter, but his district includes 5 counties, just like mine did way back yonder, starting in Person and coming on down to Warren, so you see has those five counties now.  But this week he is working in Louisburg, holding court. SN:  Good, so he&#x27;ll be able to join us. HH:  Yeah. SN:  And he&#x27;s been doing that for 11 years, is that right? HH:  No, let&#x27;s see how long, I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t keep up with all these too much, several years. 19 SN:  Right, several years. HH:  Cause he was a lawyer a while there, you know. SN:  Oh, he did practice law.  Now you practiced law before you were appointed to the bench for the Ninth District, didn&#x27;t you? HH: Well, before I was appointed to the Ninth District, that&#x27;s true. And I was County Judge sometime while I was a lawyer, when a County Judge just had one day a week. SN:  Oh, I see.  And then you did your private practice in between. What type of a practice did you have, just general practice? HH:  Anything that came along.  People ready to pay a fee and I was ready to represent them. SN:  You were doing it.  You would do traffic, I guess? HH:  Yeah, traffic was well known to be one I&#x27;d do. SN:  Right. HH:  And people would die and their families would hire you to settle the estate for the family and things like that.  Not any big money in this county, you know, just ... SN:  Small estates? HH:  Yeah.  If you looked after things, they&#x27;d hire you. SN:  Was it hard to build a practice with a town like this where there weren&#x27;t large estates? Was it? HH:  Well, yes, it was hard to build a big practice, but you could get practice most all the time because it&#x27;s one thing I did is, I represented people and they knew what I was doing and so they would employ me. SN:  I guess, then, your reputation speaks for itself. They&#x27;ve used you, they know what kind of person you are, how you are going to represent them, so they come back. HH:  Yeah, that&#x27;s right.  I never had any trouble getting re-elected. SN:  You didn&#x27;t.  I want to talk a little bit about the length of time that you spent as a judge.  What did you like and dislike about being a judge? 20 HH:  Well, I don&#x27;t know that I have anytime that I liked or disliked so much.  I just enjoyed judicial work and went about it in a judicial manner and worked.  So I never had any real problems with things like that.  So you get cases you don&#x27;t particularly like sometimes that you have to take care of and you get cases you do like sometimes and you have to take care of, so you just take it as it comes. SN:  Did you feel like you were in a position to, did you feel like you were helping people, did you get personal satisfaction out of that? HH:  I got a lot of personal satisfaction out of it.  And the pay was such that you could exist on.  It wasn&#x27;t big pay but it pay you to exist on for your family. SN: And still do work that you could enjoy and get rewards from. HH:  Yeah. SN:  Did you influence your children, your sons, the careers that they chose? HH:  I don&#x27;t know whether I did or not.  Evidently I did because they chose the same careers but I never offered to influence them. SN:  Growing up, do you feel like they were exposed by you being a judge? HH:  They were, yeah.  Because they&#x27;d be with me part of the time and they&#x27;d see what was going on.  I never at one time requested them to-be a lawyer or anything.  Betty, my daughter wanted to be a lawyer, but see she was a woman.  She couldn&#x27;t very well, you know had a family and all, she couldn&#x27;t very well do it too well. SN:  Right, but she had expressed an interest too. HH:  Yeah. SN:  So I think it probably influenced all three of them, I&#x27;m sure, your career as a judge. 21 HH:  Course you can&#x27;t get away from the fact that my wife is a well-educated woman and so you can&#x27;t put to their work just to me.  They had my wife - their mother to do things for them. SN:  Right.  And she didn&#x27;t work.  She was here raising them and being the homemaker. HH:  That&#x27;s right.  Yeah, you used the wrong word.  She did work - she worked plenty. SN:  You have to admire that for women who have that desire, I think.  I know I appreciated it.  I&#x27;m sure your children would too.  I read a quote, I want to ask you about it.  You might not remember saying it.  I read it in one of the newspapers.  There have been many newspaper articles written about you.  One was in 1977.  Actually I think this was when you spoke at Carolina at the Order of the Golden Fleece Tapping.  But you said the United States must be the world&#x27;s moral leader.  Do you remember saying that? Do you remember the context? HH:  I have said it.  I don&#x27;t know particularly where I said it but I have said that several times. SN:  Do you still feel that way? HH:  Yeah. SN:  Because we have so many natural resources.  We are such a wealthy... HH:  Yeah. We have to put it to use. SN:  Right.  And put it to good use.  And you still have close ties with UNC, the alumni. HH:  Yeah.  I don&#x27;t get there much like I used to because of my age and everything like that but I have close ties and, of course, you can&#x27;t overlook the fact that both of my sons went there.  Both graduated law schools there. SN:  Right, right.  I also have from 1977 that the Bar Association gave you the John J. Parker Award.  Is that one of the most distinguished awards that they give? HH:  The most distinguished. SN:  Is it? 22 HH:  The most distinguished award that a lawyer or judge can get, as far as I am concerned, is the John J. Parker Award. SN HH SN HH SN bar members, vote. for that award? Do they give that once a year? Well, they don&#x27;t ever give it every year. Oh, they don&#x27;t. They give it from time to time. And I&#x27;m sure all of your colleagues, all of the other Is that the way, the process to choose one HH for you SN HH SN HH SN HH Yeah.  You can&#x27;t get it.  Somebody else got to get it Do you remember receiving that award? Oh, sure. I&#x27;m sure that honored you a great deal. Yes. Did you go to Raleigh for one of the meetings? I went to meetings all over.  I don&#x27;t know about, well, Raleigh, of course that was up there where the capital is.  But I went to a lot.  Of course the John J. Parker Award was given up there in Chapel Hill. SN:  Oh, was it? HH:  Yeah, I think so.  Best I can remember offhand, but I&#x27;m not sure about that. Different times.  Go to a lot of meetings and different things, you don&#x27;t remember exactly all those things.  Particularly when you are eighty years old. SN:  I&#x27;m sure.  I was going to say a career as distinguished and as lengthy as yours has been, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s been a lot that&#x27;s happened in all those years.  In your work as a judge, were there particular people that influenced you? Other judges that you looked at and admired that you can recall? HH:  Well, there&#x27;s been a lot of judges that I&#x27;ve admired. A lot of them and I wouldn&#x27;t pick out just one to say who if was, but there are judges here and yonder that came ahead of me and some that came with me.  I could sit here and name two or three but I&#x27;d leave out two or three so I won&#x27;t do that. 23 SN:  Right, but I&#x27;m sure there were lots of people over the years who did influence you.  You said that you liked your job and felt like you had a lot personal satisfaction out of it. Was there anything difficult about it?  If you could have changed anything? HH:  Oh yeah. Well, actually you could have changed things all the time, get things better, but you just do the best you can with what you got to work with.  But I think we judges as a rule, do a pretty good job. TAPE 2, SIDE A March 20, 1991 SN:  Last time we were talking about your history and growing up and so forth.  Some of the people that I&#x27;ve talked with and some of my classmates have said that some of the former judges see the legal system as a search for truth and that the whole process, the adversarial system, is that. Do you agree or disagree? HH:  Well, I think it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to have a legal system that is trying to search for the truth and doing the best that can be done and most of the judges who become judges for some length of time certainly advocate that, I would say. SN:  Once they&#x27;ve been in the system long enough to see how it works.  Do you think it comes close to meeting that goal of actually finding truth? HH:  Well, you know this is a large state.  There&#x27;s a lot of people involved in it and it would be a little difficult for me to say if it comes close or not cause I don&#x27;t know enough about... I have probably tried more cases than most any other judge in the state because of my longevity and length of time, but still I can&#x27;t come close to knowing that. SN:  I guess you are aware of what goes on in your courtroom but beyond that? HH:  My courtroom and maybe some neighboring courtrooms but not - if I&#x27;ve tried a case in Raleigh, I very likely would not 24 know too much about what&#x27;s going on in Winston-Salem or Charlotte, or someplace like that.  I&#x27;d read - but basically I wouldn&#x27;t know too much. SN:  Once you retired they did call you back, basically they would try and get you on the phone, did you say all over the state - HH:  Yeah. SN:  Just different places, okay.  Was that over a period of what, three years , four years? HH:  Two or three years. SN:  Two or three years.  And then a year and a half ago, you tried to cut that off - HH SN HH Entirely. Entirely. And have succeeded very well, because I just didn&#x27;t do it. SN:  Just said no. HH:  Yeah.  Said No. SN:  Are you enjoying what you are doing now, just being able to relax? HH:  Certainly, I&#x27;m enjoying it very much because my wife is a very industrious person - a very educated person, and of course she did things along in her group too. And we both, she&#x27;s a year and a half younger than I am, we both quit and we both are going our ways, doing whatever we want to, together a lot of it. SN:  So you two have a really close relationship. Not just a marriage but it seems like a close relationship. HH:  Oh, yeah. SN:  All the way through.  And she&#x27;s been supportive, obviously, of everything that you&#x27;ve done. HH:  Oh, yes. - SN:  And most of your family is generally within the area? HH: Well, my daughter is in Hillsborough, and my oldest son travels the state from time to time but he lives here.  His family lives here.  His wife teaches at Louisburg College. 25 SN:  Which is where your mother taught, right? HH:  My sister. SN:  Your sister, okay. HH:  My mother taught long ago, before I was born and when I was a youngster.  And then, what else, I&#x27;ve been pretty well stuck in legal work all these years. SN:  It seems like, within your own family and then with you and your wife, like there are really strong family values. HH: Well, I hope so. SN: Do you think that&#x27;s contributed to not only your success but the success of your children? HH:  I would think so cause they had - I never told them what to do and not to do but they observed and saw and every one has - my daughter, she would not do it because she is a teacher and she doesn&#x27;t want it to interfere with the boys, but she could make an excellent legal person if she tried to.  And my two sons are both excellent in their careers. SN:  Right, so you said that she wanted to and expressed a desire and I&#x27;m sure would have done well in that area too. HH:  Yeah. My oldest boy. Judge Hobgood, he told her that if she was going to do it, he was gonna take another avenue.  He didn&#x27;t want everybody in the family to be a lawyer.  So she changed her mind. SN:  Has there been one aspect of being a judge that&#x27;s been satisfying personally? Do you get a feeling ever that you are helping people in the job that you do? HH:  Particularly in the view of young judges, I get lots of calls and lots of discussions with young judges, cause after all I&#x27;m eighty, and a lot of those are 50 and 60 and so I get a lot of conversations with them - discussions. SN: Do they call you for advice or just call you to talk with you? HH:  Talk with me and advice time to time, but the basic advice they probably know, you know, what&#x27;s going on.  I get a lot of discussions with them. 26 SN:  That&#x27;s what they are looking to, is your experience and your knowledge. HH: Lots of times I have tried cases similar to what they have tried and if there is some question in their mind, they&#x27;ll call. SN:  So they felt free enough to just pick up the phone and call you. HH:  Oh yeah. SN:  That&#x27;s good and I&#x27;m sure you feel like you are still helping being in the profession by contributing. HH:  Well, not as much as I was because I don&#x27;t get called as much and I don&#x27;t get involved as much.  I travel for one thing. SN: Do your sons call you, do they ever call for advice? HH:  Oh yeah.  Anytime they want to.  I don&#x27;t call them and I don&#x27;t suggest to them. SN:  Right. HH:  Unless they ask me something. SN:  Boy that&#x27;s a nice resource to have, isn&#x27;t it, to have someone as close as you and as knowledgeable as you to be able to refer to and to call. HH: Well, I hope so. SN:  How did you gain skill, first as a lawyer and then as a judge? Is it experience? HH: Well, you&#x27;ve got the first word - that&#x27;s desire, that you want to do what you try to do, whatever comes to be.  I&#x27;ve worked close and early since I was twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two years old, and now I&#x27;m eighty-one, see, so I&#x27;ve gained a lot of experience over a long period of time, and a lot of people. Because everybody sometimes does things they&#x27;d like to do over sometime, and like to get things right that time, so get along very well.  I try now not to do too many things, because my day is over, and I don&#x27;t care to get back into any advising.  The only time I advise is if someone comes to me in a serious situation and wants to talk to me, I listen and make suggestions. 27 SN:  So, I guess, part of it is you learn as you go, and see what you could have done... HH:  Differently. SN: Differently, right. How did you prepare for a trial when you were, HH: As what, a lawyer? SN: As a lawyer? Did you do much trial work as a lawyer? HH:  Not too much, not too much.  I became, at about twenty-two years of age, I became, at that time, called a county recorder&#x27;s court judge.  That&#x27;s a judge hearing just hum-drum cases coming along all the time.  And of course, I had the county, and I wasn&#x27;t in with another firm, I was by myself, and from about twenty-two until thirty, I did a lot of that work. And then, of course, I was in the Marine Corps, and when I came back I practiced law awhile.  And then I didn&#x27;t go back into the recorder&#x27;s court, I went back in Superior Court. SN:  You were appointed? HH: Yes, then I was elected, after appointed for a short term. SN: OK. Is there any prep work you do as a judge before a trial starts, I guess if you anticipate it being fairly involved issues, do you do anything before... HH: Am I preparing for it? SN:  Right. HH: No, not really.  I get my information from the lawyers and quiz them pretty thoroughly, and sometimes I might look up some law in reference to that particular area, SN:  Right. HH: And work that out. I can do that and I&#x27;ve done it a long time, and things are ever changing. The law today is not the same as the law was thirty years ago. SN:  While you were a judge, was it difficult to keep on top of it? HH:  Not particularly, if you kept up all the time.  You couldn&#x27;t just go around and... 28 SN:  Forget about it. HH:  Forget about it, gosh yeah. SN:  My impression of the bar, with the literature, etc., I guess knowledge gets out and it&#x27;s fairly easy to keep abreast. Were you active in the bar association? HH:  I didn&#x27;t have much time to be active in that because I was a judge.  I was at times active in the bar association, but I didn&#x27;t every have too much time for that. SN:  I think we talked about before, they awarded you the most distinguished award. HH:  That&#x27;s what they say. SN:  That&#x27;s what they tell you. HH:  [Judge Hobgood gets up and walks around and looks at his awards on the wall] SN:  You&#x27;ve got several awards, right many.  So the Walter Clark Award was a prestigious award? HH:  I knew Judge Walter Clark when I was a young man. SN:  Did you really? What do you remember about him, does anything stand out? HH:  Oh, good Lord, yeah, I&#x27;ll tell you, that judge... SN:  What area was he in? HH:  He didn&#x27;t practice, he was a judicial man.  I never knew too much of him as a lawyer, but as a judge. SN:  Where was he a judge, what area? HH: We have an area down here called Roanoke Rapids, right below here, and others around there and in that area was where he was. SN:  So, he had an outstanding reputation? HH: All over the state. SN:  I was going to ask, are there any other judges that stand out to you that were mentors? HH:  Well, I&#x27;d hate to call names, because I&#x27;d leave out some I should take, but there were a number of them. SN:  To be a successful judge, what do you believe are some of the important values to have? 29 HH:  Well, first the thing above everything else is to have desire, desire to do whatever you try to do.  Not to just brush it aside and just leave it for somebody else, and I don&#x27;t know particularly, some judges are good in some fields and others in other fields, and on like that.  You can be a real good trial judge, you&#x27;ve got to be good in all of them, to some extent. SN:  That&#x27;s true. HH:  So, I&#x27;ve tried to. SN:  Is patience important? HH:  Very, very important, very much. SN:  Because I guess you&#x27;re in the spot light a large part of the time in your work, and I guess a lot of what goes on in the courtroom can be a reaction to how you control it, in the manner in which you preside.  Do you think there&#x27;s a difference in values that attorneys should have as opposed to any different values that a judge should possess? HH:  Well, you have judges who are different and you have attorneys who are different. And I would say that attorneys, they are determined on what they&#x27;re trying to do, they are concentrating on that.  Some attorneys are trial attorneys and very few really do criminal work, compared to civil work in most cases.  Over a period of time then you have trial work, but you have district attorneys who do it all the time for the states, you know.  And then they get out of it and go into civil work. SN:  I guess it seems like for attorneys coming before a judge, they want to be persuasive, whereas the judge is wanting to be more objective, about what he sees.  How would you compare the quality of judges and lawyers at the end of your career with those at the beginning? Did you see a difference? HH:  Well, there&#x27;s one difference in judges and lawyers as time goes on.  They get, years ago, and time before that, you&#x27;ve got lawyers and judges who were good, and knew what they were doing, but they were not legally prepared as judges and lawyers are today by reading and research, and things of that nature. They were more coming up rather without too much study. 30 SN:  I think that speaks well of the profession, if people are more... HH:  They&#x27;re more prepared now than they used to be. SN:  And are working hard to find out the law.  We talked a little about ethics.  It seems like for the bar, they&#x27;re trying to implement more and more standards. Do you feel like ethics have changed? HH:  I doubt it, I doubt it.  I think the individual, we&#x27;ll say first a judge, is high in ethics.  He may not be as studied and as good as he would be today, thirty, forty years ago, but he studies ethics high and wants things to be right. And the judge, that&#x27;s the judge, and the lawyer, you got all sorts of lawyers, just like you&#x27;ve got all sorts of other people in other professions. SN:  That&#x27;s true. HH:  You&#x27;ve got lawyers with high ethics, and you got some not worth a damn sometimes.  Not many, most of them get out, one way or another. SN:  They don&#x27;t last, I guess their true character starts to show... HH:  That&#x27;s right, you don&#x27;t have many anymore.  So it&#x27;s hard to put your thumb in one thing. SN: Do you think it&#x27;s good the fact that they&#x27;re emphasizing the ethics part? HH:  I think so.  You&#x27;ve got to, it&#x27;s highly involved human beings altogether... SN:  Especially money, I think it seems like, I know on the ethics exam they question you a lot about clients&#x27; money and how you handle it.  I think that&#x27;s good, too.  Do you think that the legal profession is viewed differently in a small town like Louisburg and Bunn than, say, in Raleigh? HH:  Yeah.  It&#x27;s different in this respect.  In Raleigh, you concentrate usually on one activity, on one person or one group or one company or whatnot, that you&#x27;re working with. Whereas in a small town like Louisburg and this county, this rural county, 31 you get to know a little bit about everything.  It may not be as prepared in Louisburg on the job that one lawyer is doing in Raleigh, but that one lawyer in Raleigh would be lost trying to do all the things the lawyer in Louisburg would be doing. SN:  That&#x27;s true, so I guess here with a practice you have a wide range of areas that you&#x27;re in.  Are attorneys in a small town like this, are attorneys held in high esteem? HH:  I think basically they are, they.get to be known better.  And of course, get to be known better, but if they&#x27;re not too hot, by their services... SN:  That&#x27;s going to be known, too, I guess. HH:  That&#x27;s going to be known, too. SN:  That&#x27;s true.  What in your life in terms of cases or decisions are you most proud of, or do any stand out? HH:  I tell you, you couldn&#x27;t very well answer that, because you have all sorts of cases, all sorts of times and decisions, and I&#x27;ve tried actually thousands of cases... SN:  Have you really? HH:  Yeah, you can&#x27;t put your finger right on one, two, or three.  You have cases that make their mark, but others come along... SN:  It almost boggles the mind to think of how many, when you look back over it, you think did I do all of that? HH:  Lot of cases were short lived, go in and try them that day, and some cases last for weeks and so it&#x27;s very difficult. I&#x27;ve enjoyed my work very much, you see at 80, I&#x27;ve had a lot of opportunities to do a lot of things, done a lot of things, and fortunately I&#x27;ve had good respect from people.  You get the opportunity that you going to do what you think&#x27;s right, and you don&#x27;t worry about it.  Judge Hight would say he&#x27;s going to do, all right you tell them, and you tell them it&#x27;s not what they want to be done, they just go ahead... SN:  You&#x27;re matter of fact, people know what to expect from you, they know how you&#x27;re going to conduct a court, they know how 32 you&#x27;re going to act, and they know what to expect from you, and I think that&#x27;s good, you&#x27;re not seen as being wishy-washy or... HH:  I hope not. SN:  In the oral history seminar your name was mentioned most often as the man to talk to about North Carolina practice. HH:  Well, it will be less and less from now on, cause I&#x27;m getting older and doing less of it. SN:  As you try to drop more and more out of the picture, somehow I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to let you do that as easily as you might want to. HH:  Yeah, you get a lot of younger people, they don&#x27;t know me now, I&#x27;m staying out of that. SN:  It seems like you&#x27;ve been fortunate in terms of having a good career, good family, and you seem like you&#x27;ve enjoyed a tremendous amount what you&#x27;ve done, is that true? HH:  That&#x27;s true. SN:  Other than work, and your judicial activities, are there any other personal accomplishments that you&#x27;re proud of or that have meant a lot to you? HH:  Well, no, because the judicial would come in and people would call upon me to advise them in some kind of situation they&#x27;d gotten into, and you felt real pleased when they&#x27;d follow you and get out of whatever they were in to, wouldn&#x27;t have to be bad, but something they needed to do. SN: Maybe just a quandary, they couldn&#x27;t make a decision. So you mean personally, people you might know, would maybe call you and ask for advice. HH SN HH SN HH SN HH Yeah, hundreds of times. Really, people in the town respected you, I guess. Well, town, county, state. Really? Other judges, other lawyers. I would think that would be very satisfying, too. I never have been a lawyer too much because I&#x27;ve been busy being a judge... 33 SN:  Being a judge, you started early. HH:  I started real early, and then after I got going in that I did pretty good, I went into World War II, you know the major war and joined that, and came back and I went into the law field, but it wasn&#x27;t long before I was back in the judge field. SN:  You were even a judge before you finished law school, isn&#x27;t that right? HH:  Oh, yeah. SN:  That&#x27;s been in your system, hasn&#x27;t it? HH:  It sure has. SN:  Now, I remember reading that when you were serving in the service, that you helped to pass out ballots and tried to get others to vote? Is that the case? HH:  I don&#x27;t know exactly what you mean by that. SN:  I read while you were maybe in Hawaii, while you were in the Pacific, the Pacific... HH:  Theater. SN:  Theater, I guess it was absentee voting that... HH:  Well, I&#x27;ve helped a lot with that. SN:  That&#x27;s what I remember reading, I guess that was important to you then... HH:  Well, not particularly, but see, when I was in, after I went in service, then I was on the East Coast here, then on the West Coast, then I went to, out into, really, what you would call the Middle Pacific, then I went on out to where the fighting was going for awhile.  Then I came back, and when I came back I did a lot of activities. SN: If you had it to do over again - the service - was that a worthwhile experience? HH:  Yeah, it was worthwhile, I don&#x27;t regret it... SN:  You got to travel a lot and meet a lot of people, I&#x27;m sure. HH: Yeah, and another thing I, the reason I don&#x27;t regret it much, I didn&#x27;t physically do any fighting. I supervised a lot of groups that did fighting, but not physically were we in battle, 34 the battle was five hundred, three hundred miles, two hundred miles... SN:  So you were there, but not in the middle of the action? HH:  Yeah, and I&#x27;d done a lot of this kind of work, and even when I was in the Marine Corps, there were other officers called me judge. SN: Did they really? Called you judge.  It seems like the bar likes to keep judicial activities separate from political activities.  Has that been most of the case throughout your career? HH:  What do you mean? SN: Well, I guess being__ HH:  Do I want to be a judge instead of in politics? SN:  It seems like they like for judges to be more neutral. I guess I&#x27;m wondering if that was the case when you first started? HH:  I think so, I think it is, if a man&#x27;s going to be a judge, he&#x27;s supposed to be a judge, not get involved in political activity.  I did a lot of that. SN:  You did a lot... HH:  Not political. SN:  I wonder if that was the case back when you... HH:  Well, it&#x27;s more up to the individual back yonder than it is now.  But I selected being a judge more than I did being political. SN:  You thought that was your calling so you concentrated on it. Would you like to take a break? HH:  I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s up to you. SN:  We might go a little longer, I think, I&#x27;m fine.  She [your wife] takes good care of us, doesn&#x27;t she? You hear the term judicial temperament.  What does that mean to you? HH:  Judicial temperament means to me that the individual involved in it is looking at the problem, not as a personal problem, but as a judicial problem, and therefore a judicial temperament is a person who is looking at all sides of it and 35 make a logical decision to him or her, a logical decision.  It&#x27;s not a question of deciding one way or another. SN:  Do you recall times when it was ever hard to do that, or... HH:  Well, it&#x27;s always sometimes difficult to, if you have much of a case to make it exactly... SN:  Right. HH:  But I never had too much trouble. SN:  It may come more natural because you did it for such a long, it wasn&#x27;t like you had a lengthy career as an attorney, and then became a judge. HH:  Actually, I think a man has a lengthy position as an attorney by the time he&#x27;s twenty-five or thirty years old until he&#x27;s fifty, then he gets to be a judge he has a difficult time beginning, whereas I kept jumping back into the judicial side. SN:  What are your duties as an attorney to your client, to your profession, to your community, as an attorney, not as a judge? HH:  As an attorney, of course, you have a responsibility of looking after the rights of the person that you&#x27;re representing if you&#x27;re an attorney, and at the same time, you have a responsibility to not follow necessarily what he wants, but what he should do. SN:  That&#x27;s not always easy. HH:  That&#x27;s not easy, that&#x27;s not easy.  Because he wants to hire you to represent his wants, and you sometimes have to tell him, I&#x27;ll do the best I can, but we have to go back and do what&#x27;s got to be done, and not to do otherwise.  Well, the lawyers come in and they, between the fine lawyers and those that go in there the other way. SN:  Right, that&#x27;s true. What about as a judge? What are your duties to both parties when you&#x27;re in the courtroom presiding? HH:  Forget the individuals and do it according to what is called on judicially appointed to do. 36 SN:  Does it make a difference, do you think you, a lot of times you were presiding in some of the counties outside of Raleigh, because I guess a lot of the attorneys that came before you, did you know them personally? HH:  Oh, yes, I&#x27;ve known attorneys forever. SN:  Right. HH:  I started so early.  It doesn&#x27;t make any difference, I don&#x27;t have to be beholden to them just because I know them. SN: What about the plaintiffs and defendants, would you know a lot of them in some cases? HH:  Well, in some cases I would, but generally speaking, not too many. SN:  You encountered more of the lawyers... HH:  Yeah, I knew the lawyers real well, and the parties I didn&#x27;t know too well. SN:  There&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on stress and how you handle job, your commitment to your families, was that an issue in the years that you were a judge? HH:  Stress? SN: Uh-huh, was it stressful? HH:  Of course, I was different from some people, I was in it so much, but I&#x27;ve never got bothered too much by stress.  At times you could, particularly when you&#x27;ve got people you know. Most judges who have cases with considerable involved, matters involved in them, would like to try cases they don&#x27;t know, the people, in most areas a lot of times to get over with, switch cases of individuals they know, somebody else takes them. SN:  So they won&#x27;t have that conflict. HH:  Yeah, it&#x27;d be awfully difficult for a man like me sitting here trying cases in this county, and I know everybody in this county, I mean, not everybody, but people, SN:  You know families, exactly. HH:  So, therefore, I tried not to try too many cases locally, when I was trying cases. 37 SN:  I see, just so you wouldn&#x27;t have that conflict.  Did you have to come home and do stuff at night and on weekends? HH:  Oh, yes, you always, it just depends on what you&#x27;re doing... SN:  Your caseload. HH: What it calls for and all, work nights and days, I tried to limit my appointed time and keep myself physically fit you might say, and involved, but I never had too much trouble, but you have to keep going, you can&#x27;t stand still... SN:  Sit still, I guess it&#x27;ll pass you by.  The last time I was here I heard your son mention something about a paper that you had written on race and poverty or something in that area? HH:  I don&#x27;t know what that was right offhand, I&#x27;ve written so many papers... SN:  Have you really?  I might check with him then and see. .. HH:  I don&#x27;t recall, I do have a hard time (the phone rings) SN:  You don&#x27;t recall. HH:  Might have a hard time, it&#x27;s necessary, my son, of course, you understand, he&#x27;s busy, he&#x27;s working... SN:  And he travels HH: And he travels, and it depends on, mostly he&#x27;s the, the job I had, he&#x27;s the judge of this judicial district, which is five counties. SN: Now, is that the same, did you have the same five counties? HH:  I had the same ones, yeah, in fact it was organized back when I was young, and I helped with that.  You see, that is Franklin here, Louisburg, and the largest one, of course, is Henderson, and that&#x27;s the largest county in the district, you see, and it started way down, well east, and as you come up here, five different counties, Oxford, do you know where Oxford is? SN:  Right. HH:  Roxboro&#x27;s the furtherest... SN:  That&#x27;s a long distance, a very long distance... 38 HH:  Yeah, Roxboro, Oxford and Henderson and Warrenton and Louisburg, so you see we have five counties responsible for, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s where the judge stops work, he&#x27;s just there a certain length of time and then he goes to big counties like Durham and Raleigh, and all those places.  You know, I did more work in Raleigh and Durham than most anybody, they would send me up to Charlotte. SN:  Now, how does that happen, if these were your five counties, how did it happen that you were in Raleigh or Charlotte? HH:  Cause that&#x27;s the way it works.  Cause they don&#x27;t let a man stay in his home counties but just a certain length of time. Switch it around.  And, of course, the place where there&#x27;s the most going on is where you spend the most time.  I spent more time in Raleigh than any other county during my whole time and second most in Durham. SN:  Did you really? HH:  Yeah, cause it was busy, lots to be done. SN:  So you weren&#x27;t just limited to the area here, of course your son, Judge Hobgood, isn&#x27;t either. HH:  They make up a schedule every morning, I mean not every morning, but every year and you go from place to place... SN:  Oh, and who makes that schedule up? HH:  Really, over in Raleigh in the administration office, make it up in the judicial end. SN:  OK.  If you had anything to do different, if you could go back, what if anything would you change? HH:  I doubt it, I doubt it. SN:  You wouldn&#x27;t? That&#x27;s a pretty good philosophy to have then. HH:  I would think maybe I would do some things better than I did before, in my opinion, I think basically I would do about the same things. SN: Any advice that you could give to young lawyers and/or judges today? 39 HH:  I&#x27;m mighty slow on giving advice and things like that, but I would say that I would advise young people to be prepared what they were doing, because otherwise you get yourself in a bind. SN:  So, I guess be as well read as you can. HH: As prepared as you can on the legal end of it, and also be careful of what you say, that&#x27;s very important, too. You have to back up on what you say a lot of times. SN:  You seem to be satisfied personally and professionally with your job, too.  To what, if anything, can you attribute your success? HH:  Work. SN:  What? HH:  To work. SN:  To work? HH:  My success is by doing what you&#x27;re supposed to do, every day, month, year. SN:  In reading about your parents and your sisters and your children, too, there seems to be a strong work ethic in all of them. HH:  Yeah, all of them, just do what you need to do. 40</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interview with EDWARD M. BERNSTEIN November 14, 21-23, 1983 The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. By Stanley W. Black Transcribed by Amy Glass The Southern Oral History Program Copyright fcT) 1984 The University of North Carolina 1 Stanley Black:  You were born in Bayonne, N.J.? Edward Bernstein: Yes. I was born there in 1904. We moved to New York about 1917. I was brought up in Jamaica, Long Island which was then an extreme part of New York City on Long Island, hardly much settled in those days. S.B.:  What was your father doing? Bernstein: My father was an insurance agent and later a business broker. S.B.:  Business broker? Bernstein:  Yes, he sold businesses--little businesses. S.B.:  Bought and sold them both? Bernstein:  No, he was a broker, he arranged the sales. S.B.:  I see.  Do you have brothers and sisters? Bernstein:  I have two sisters  I&#x27;m the youngestone of whom is alive, she&#x27;s about eighty-five. S.B.:  Did the others go to college, as well as yourself? Bernstein:  No, I was the only one who went to college in my family.  There weren&#x27;t many boys, and we didn&#x27;t have the tradition of girls going to college seventy years ago. I was the only one in my family who went to college  but, then, I was the only boy in the family.  But my cousins did go and, in fact, one of my cousins won the Nobel Prize in physics. S.B.:  Oh, is that right?  Who is that? Bernstein:  His name is Arno Penzias and he&#x27;s vice president of AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Laboratories. 2 S.B.:  How do you spell Penzias? Bernstein:  P-e-n-z-i-a-s.  So when I say I&#x27;m the only one, I&#x27;m talking about children in our own family.  In fact, my father had no brothers, and he had one sister.  We weren&#x27;t a prolific family.  But the connections through my father&#x27;s sister provided more boys and girls and they were very good. S.B.:  So, you went to the University of Chicago.  What area were you interested in at that time? Bernstein:  I was interested in two things.  I was interested in economics because I liked economics and wanted to become an economist, though I thought also of being a journalist specializing in economics.  But I mainly enjoyed, for fun, the department of anthropology. S. B. :  Oh, I see. Bernstein:  We were a small group at Chicago in those days; undergraduates and graduates mixed easily and, in fact, after my second year I took almost all graduate courses.  I moved very easily with the ten or twelve people who were specializing in anthropology, though I knew the faculty in economics much better. S.B.:  What sort of anthropological interests did you actually have? Bernstein:  Mainly ethnology, that meant the American Indians.  I don&#x27;t think I went much farther than that, a little bit in physical anthropology.  I was short one course 3 to make my major in economics; the University waived it.  So that waiving ... S.B.:  Because you&#x27;d taken so much in the other area? Bernstein:  Well, it wasn&#x27;t quite that.  I took too many courses in other fields, including history and philosophy.  It&#x27;s true, I had more in anthropology than I needed for a minor.  You had to have a field of specialization, and a secondary field.  My secondary field was just a little shorter than my major field, which was economics.  I should have had one more course in economics, but the University waived it. S.B.:  And your major field, then, was . . . Bernstein:  Economics.  I was graduated with honors in economics and in sociology and anthropology. S.B.:  I see, very interesting. Bernstein:  Phi Beta Kappa, too, and I held an honor scholarship in my senior year. S.B.:  What determined you on becoming an economist, or studying that, before you even went there? Bernstein:  Yes, I was an economist, a professional economist since the age of fifteen or sixteen. S.B.:  What were you doing at fifteen or sixteen that got you . . . Bernstein:  I won the prize in New York County for the best essay on the port of New York.  I was given twenty-five dollars in gold.  My high school teachers, obviously, were terribly pleased.  I had learned a little of the jargon of 4 economics and used that in the essay.  We had a very good teacher of elementary economics at high school. S.B.:  What high school was that? Bernstein:  This was Dewitt Clinton High School, the oldest boys high school in New York.  The teacher, named Foote, was a Harvard A.B. and A.M., and of course he was pleased to see his student doing so well. Teachers are like that. S.B.:  So you got interested, I suppose a bit, by watching what your father was doing, and then you went on into studying the ... Bernstein:  Yes, my father once explained to me why gold coins didn&#x27;t depreciate during World War I.  You must bear in mind that during World War I I was old enough to talk in a sensible way.  Being born in late 1904, by 1916 I was twelve years old and probably a little more interested in the affairs of the world than boys generally are at that age.  We had a couple of Napoleonsgold Napoleonsand my father took them to the bank and we received, in U.S. dollars, the equivalent of the gold content.  But at that time, my father explained to me, French francs weren&#x27;t really worth nineteen cents apiece, but the gold coins were. I wouldn&#x27;t say this started me on economics, but it does indicate that we talked about economics at our house, about the state of the universe.  It was a family in which a good deal of talking went on. 5 S.B.:  And that led you through the course work you did in high school to do the study on the port? Bernstein:  Yes; that was a project for high school students.  Everybody in the city of New York was writing on it. S.B.:  Everyone was doing it, yours was just the one that won the prize. Bernstein:  That*a right.  Nearly everyone was doing it.  Let&#x27;s put it this way, not everybody took economics and there were separate prizes for different counties in the city.  I won the one for New York County, I don&#x27;t know who the other ones were. S.B.:  On to Chicago? Bernstein:  Yes, well they welcomed me there.  You know, the University of Chicago was a wonderful place to study. S.B.:  Who were the teachers at that time? Bernstein:  I had Viner, I had a man named Millis, chairman of the department. S.B.:  Mintz? Bernstein:  No, Millis was a specialist in labor.  I didn&#x27;t get any of the great teachers of money at Chicago. In fact, the one I had was simple-minded.  One indication of that was a ten-minute quiz on the question *Which of these would make a good monetary standard?&#x27;  He went through tin, and copper and iron and wheat and rubber, and other commodities.  The question was obvious nonsense.  And so I 6 wroteI was then a pretty wise-guythat rubber would make an excellent standard because it would give us an elastic currency daughter].  When I wrote that, he called me in and said he understood why I felt the course was too simple, but nevertheless the others needed a course like this and it wasn&#x27;t proper for me to do this wise-guy bit.  It does give you an indication that the class in money in 1925 or &#x27;26 wasn&#x27;t very good.  It was much better later on.  On the other hand, the courses in theory, in international trade and finance were very good. S.B.:  Viner was teaching both, it sounds like. Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  The courses in labor were also good.  Millis, the chairman of the department, taught those courses.  I&#x27;ll tell you a very interesting point.  As I was very friendly with Millis I got to know Harry Wolf at Chicago.  Harry Wolf was a graduate student, had come out of World War I, having lost a leg, and later was a professor at Chapel Hill when I came there.  He was much older than I, of course.  He was the only man I knew at Chapel Hill from the past. S.B.:  So he was kind of a person to welcome you in? Bernstein:  Yes, that&#x27;s right, we were neighbors in Bingham Hall and we enjoyed each other. S.B.:  Were there econometricians you worked with or mainly you did trade and theorythose were your specialist areas? Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  And later, money. 7 S.B.:  But that was your undergraduate . . .mighty fine teachers that you had theret Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  The distinction between undergraduates and graduates was very thin at Chicago. After the second year a person specializing in a field was expected to take the graduate courses.  So, the truth was that in anthropology and in economics I took mainly graduate courses. S.B.:  When you got to Harvard was there anything left to learn? Bernstein:  Not very much in what was accepted theory then.  A good deal in money and business cycles.  Viner is supposed to have said that the best combination for an economist was to go to college at Chicago and take a doctorate at Harvard.  I&#x27;m not sure it wouldn&#x27;t be just as good in reverse, and I&#x27;m not sure that the same people wouldn&#x27;t do just as well at two other universities.  But it&#x27;s true, coming to Harvard I ran through the courses fairly easily.  I had the scholarship of the Harvard Club of Chicago at Harvard, and I had Taussig as my professor.  He became very fond of me, perhaps because he enjoyed my examination paper on theory.  I took a competitive examinationessay contestand won it (I was always good at writing quickly), so that I was the Ricardo Prize Scholar in 1928-29, which paid me about four hundred dollars, or maybe five. S.B.:  That was for writing an essay? 6 Bernstein: A competitive essay, yes. S.B.:  On what subject? Bernstein:  Well, they gave a choice of topics.  The topic that year was trade unions and I wrote one on what trade unions can and can&#x27;t do.  I also applied for a fellowship and I got the University Fellowship simultaneously so with the combination of the Ricardo Prize Scholarship and the University Fellowship, I had a lot of money from Harvard. S.B.:  I would guess so, in those days) Bernstein:  At that stage, this is 1928, I was still thinking in terms of journalism.  So I went down to New York to see Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation.  Ha said, &quot;You know, jobs are very hard and journalism doesn&#x27;t pay much,&quot; but he said he&#x27;d let me write an editorial for The Nation, which I did.  I wrote an editorial on a Supreme Court decision on utility rate making.  We had dealt poorly with utility rate making and other problems too during and after World War I, much more poorly than we do now, during an inflation which was larger than 1914-29.  Well I got twenty-five dollars for that editorial, having spent more than a week on it daughter].  And when I came back to Cambridge I discovered I&#x27;d won all these things.  Well that meant that I could make more from my fellowship and scholarship than I could writing for The Nation, and I opted to stay on at Harvard. S.B.:  You made an economic decision daughter]. 9 Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right, I made a straight decision. I was encouraged to do this by Taussig.  He was the best of my teachers and I worked with him for three years.  The first year I had Hawtrey in money, and he was a very bad teacher but a great thinker.  He introduced me for the first time into the way one should think about money.  You know his concept of consumer income and outlay, and the effect of interest rates and tight money on investment in traders&#x27; inventories, and so on? S.B.:  Yes. Bernstein:  It was a completely new approach. S.B.:  He was visiting that year? Bernstein:  He was visiting.  He replaced Young in 1927-28.  Young was Harvard&#x27;s rising star, and ha had gone to the London School of Economics as a visiting professor. He died there.  In the meantime, we had visiting professors. That year we had Hawtrey to teach money, and the next year we had Schumpeter.  So in my first year in the course in money I had Hawtrey and it was a great innovation.  The concepts of income and outlay as the method by which money works and the role of the trader in a period of tight money and high interest rates cutting down his inventories were new to me and set me on the right course in money and business cycles.  In my second year I had Schumpeter, so that I had very good teachers there. S.B.:  Schumpeter was teaching theory? Bernstein:  No.  Theory came only from Taussig. Schumpeter was teaching what would be the equivalent of business cycles.  I also had Bullock and he wasn&#x27;t an easy man to live with. S.B.:  I&#x27;ve heard. Bernstein:  He was accustomed to making very rude remarks and he had small classes in the history of economic thought.  We would sit around the class in alphabetical order, eight or ten people, and as my name began with Bernstein, I sat next to Bullock.  He was a very conservative man, and a bitter man too.  He had lost a son in the war and he didn*t like the kind of liberalism that was popular in the &#x27;20s--although it wasn&#x27;t really very liberal.  Boston had a kind of town meeting called the &quot;Open Forum&quot; and he would refer to it as the &quot;Open Forum, Open Whorem.&quot;  He also had a strong bias against immigrants and he said he didn&#x27;t think they had been very patriotic during World War I.  I may have been too young to know, but I thought there wasn&#x27;t much in that proposition.  So I once recalled to him in class that New England had a conference at Hartford to secede from the Union during the war of 1812. He didn&#x27;t reply to that. Bullock had edited Adam Smith&#x27;s Wealth of Nations for the Harvard Classics.  The course in the history of economic thought was one-third Hesiod and two-thirds Adam Smith.  I enjoyed the Wealth of Nations.  I found two or three places where Adam Smith made some of the mistakes on money that became common in the nineteenth century.  For example, Adam Smith was very good on the concept that the Bank of England couldn&#x27;t increase the money supply by issuing more notes as this would lead to an outflow of specie.  But he thought it was different if the extra issue was to increase loans to business.  You see, he was getting to the 19th century banking concept there.  There were one or two other little points like that.  After all, Adam Smith wasn&#x27;t perfect, he was just exceptional!  And this impressed Mr. Bullock.  In my second year, I spent half my time with Taussig, just writing papers.  I took two courses in economics and history, but I gave that much less time than writing papers. I would deliver a paper to Taussig every Friday and we would talk about it, and I would rewrite it.  He published two of these notes of mine in the Quarterly Journal.  But the most important thing that happened in my second year was that I passed the examination with distinction and quit classes on May 1st. S.B.:  Why was that? Bernstein:  Taussig said he had a job for me.  He didn&#x27;t think I needed more courses.  He and I saw eye to eye.  His notion of learning was what was called &quot;Economics Twenty.&quot;  You came to see a professor and wrote a paper every single week.  Later the question came up whether I had finished enough courses to qualify for the Ph.D., but as usual the Economics Department waived it.  I went to teach at De Pauw University in Greencastle, Indiana for a half 12 year, taking the place of a professor who had a sabbatical. I came back to Cambridge in February and finished my dissertation around June 20th or so.  It was the hottest summer. S.B.:  June of what year? Bernstein:  June, 1930.  It was the hottest summer I have seen since then and I sat in my rooms at Farwell Place, a little street behind the First Church in Cambridge.  I sat in the nude, typing, and every half hour I took a shower. When I submitted what I thought was a draft, Taussig said, &quot;That&#x27;s good enough, there&#x27;s no use wasting your time on this--go to work!&quot; S.B.:  What was the subject? Bernstein:  It was the impact of prices and interest rates on utilities during World War I.  So I started with a simple concept of inflation, and it was not until later, when I tried to analyze the Great Depression in terms of the money supply and exchange rates, that I really began to understand inflation. S.B.:  Now, what was the main point that you were making in this study? Bernstein:  The main point was that utilities were not earning enough to supply a growing demand.  Unless they had enough return, they couldn&#x27;t expand capacity, although actually they did, in spite of inadequate earnings. S.B.:  And you had to worry about the rate base having its value in historical costs . . . Bernstein:  Yes, or a reproduction cost, something we don&#x27;t bother with anymore. S.B.:  And so there was some need for figuring out how to deal with that. Bernstein:  Yes, that&#x27;s right.  The question was what would be reasonable from the point of view of the investor, the expanding supply of utility services, and what the consumer had to pay.  I didn&#x27;t go much into the cause of the inflation.  Taussig, as you know, was on the Price Control Commission in World War I.  And he wrote an article called &quot;Price Fixing as Seen by a Price Fixer.&quot;  He thought that, on the whole, it wasn&#x27;t a bad idea to fix prices during the war.  I think the main concept in modern terms is that if you allow prices to rise out of hand during a war, it is inevitable that you&#x27;ll have wages increasing to offset the price rise.  Letting market prices prevail in a period of artificial scarcity can give you prices which are unrelated to what you will have once the war scarcity is over.  In the meantime, however, you may build this scarcity into costs forever.  And I think that&#x27;s probably the best argument that can be made for price control during an inflation. I finished my dissertation near the end of June, took the examination at the end of the month, and then went home waiting for a job.  I didn&#x27;t have much difficulty for a very simple reason:  Taussig was determined to place me.  So, when North Carolina State College invited, or asked me to come meet them in Washington, I did, and they offered me a job as an Associate Professor at three thousand dollars a year, that suited me just fine, three thousand.  I was twenty-five years old and thought that was a lot of money. S.B.:  It sounds like you were starting not at the bottom. Bernstein:  No, I didn&#x27;t start at the bottom.  To tell you the truth, although my wife doesn&#x27;t like me to say it, all my life I&#x27;ve been overappreciated, overhonored and overpaid.  Everywhere I went I got to the top of the scale very fast. S.B.:  It helps to have the talent with words, and writing. Bernstein:  Maybe, oh yes, there&#x27;s nothing like being able to write.  Being able to write is a remarkable gift. There&#x27;s none better, if you can also think.  That combination of thinking well and writing clearly and quickly is invaluable. S.B.:  Who brought you to N.C. State?  Taussig gave your name, of course. Bernstein:  Well, you see Taussig wouldn&#x27;t submit any name except mine when he was recommending me.  They didn&#x27;t have any choice, it was take it or leave it.  There was a little problem, not about my competence; there wasn&#x27;t a single Jew on the faculty at North Carolina State, nor, for that matter, at Chapel Hill in those days. S.B.:  In the department of economics or totally? Bernstein:  No, anywhere in the University, with tenure.  Well, there weren&#x27;t many at Harvard for that matter.  But nevertheless there were none at North Carolina even though there were two Jews on the executive committee of the trustees:  Cone, of Cone mills in Greensboro and Weil of Goldsboro.  So it wasn&#x27;t a question of prejudice.  As a matter of fact the dean said to me (this is at North Carolina State), &quot;The faculty wouldn&#x27;t mind at all, and I don&#x27;t think the trustees would mind, but there may be some students who aren&#x27;t accustomed to having Jewish teachers, but if you&#x27;re willing to come, we&#x27;re glad to have you.&quot;  I was perfectly willing to come.  I was very fortunate, too, because right after I came everybody began to realize that this was no ordinary cyclical decline, it was a Great Depression.  And I had a job during this period. S.B.:  You had a pretty good salary for the time? Bernstein:  I think it was standard.  Three thousand was the standard entry salary, though I think if I had gone to a northern university it would have been at a lower rank with the same money.  It would have been Assistant Professor at three thousand instead of an Associate. S.B.:  Your money probably went a bit farther there. Bernstein:  Yes, it went farther in North Carolina than it would have in the North. S.B.:  How did you find N.C. State as a place to start out? Bernstein:  Well, N.C. State was a little bit like Chapel Hill, except, shall we put it, not quite as literate. The students ranged from rather poor to a handful of very good.  They also had women there--in fact, it was more coed than Chapel Hillso that the women, who always do their work, were on the whole better students.  It may also be that the women were better students because they couldn&#x27;t go to Chapel Hill, unless they lived in Chapel Hill or unless they were going to the last year. S.B.:  The women? Bernstein:  The women.  They had to go to Greensboro, and then they would be in a women&#x27;s college, or they could go to State and then be in a coed college.  I had good women students, while the men ranged from poor to good.  The women were uniformly fair to good.  I&#x27;m not setting low standards; I&#x27;m setting the same standards I would today.  I taught theory and I taught money and I had my first chance to discuss what I think about money.  I taught the basic concept that money had a function and it wasn&#x27;t to act as a store of value and medium of exchange, that sort of stuff. The function of money was to regulate the production, distribution and utilization of the national income.  That was the definition I gave my class and later went into my book. Money and the Economic System.  The monetary standard is not the piece of commodity you get for a unit of money, the standard is the method by which you regulate the supply of money.  What makes the gold standard is not that you can convert a dollar into gold, it&#x27;s that the monetary authorities can&#x27;t issue any reserve money unless they have a certain reserve of gold. This book made a very big impression in a lot of places.  One New York publisher, Harcourt Brace, would have been glad to have it if I would add some chapters on banking, but I didn&#x27;t think I knew enough to write a book on banking.  Chapel Hill was very glad to get the book.  It got a very good reception, especially in the better universitiesat Princeton, at Harvard they used it. Samuelson told one of my students it was the best book on money written up to that time.  At Princeton, a man now chairman of the department of economics at Pennsylvania State University, wrote a dissertation on the meaning of the standard in which he says that I was among the first to make the point that the significance of the standard is its control over the supply of money.  So it did have a very good reception, especially abroad.  It sold out the first printing, oh, in about three or four years. S.B.:  This book was done while you were still at N.C. State? Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  It was published while I was still at N.C. State.  We now come to how I came to Chapel Hill.  The Roosevelt Administration was about to appoint a new director of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. The President had chosen Willard Thorpe to be the new director.  But the chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce was &quot;Cotton&quot; Ed Smith of South Carolina. In the hearings he discovered that Thorpe had registered as a Republican at Amherst (he was teaching there), and &quot;Cotton&quot; Ed Smith said he was damned if he was going to allow the confirmation of a Republican after all these years, so the President withdrew the nomination of Thorpe. He did other things for Thorpe in return, much more remunerative.  He appointed him as one of the trustees in the liquidation of one of the big utility holding companies, in which the fees set by the court were generally fitted to what would go to a distinguished lawyer. S.B.:  It was a bankruptcy case? Bernstein:  Not quite; a reorganization.  Later, of course, he became Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.  So I got to know him well. S.B.:  You got to know him because of your utility rate work? Bernstein:  No, I didn&#x27;t get to know Willard Thorpe until I came to Washington and worked on international economic policy. S.B.:  Oh, I see.  Well we&#x27;re back on how you got to Chapel Hill. Bernstein:  When &quot;Cotton&quot; Ed Smith said he couldn&#x27;t take a Republican, they looked around for someone from the South who was definitely a Democrat and they picked Claudius Murceson, who was at Chapel Hill.  He taught money and business cycles and this was my specialty too.  So Chapel Hill needed a quick replacement.  The department decided on me because I had already written this book on money and they thought they could persuade Graham, who was the president of the joint university, to arrange for me to move over to Chapel Hill.  Graham wasn&#x27;t that easy, he was very fair. Just as Chapel Hill needed someone quickly, so North Carolina State couldn&#x27;t spare anybody very quickly.  The conclusion was that I would be relieved of some teaching at Raleigh, and teach in both places.  I would teach money in both places and business cycles in Chapel Hill.  And so for two years I moved back and forth. S.B.:  Which years would this have been? Bernstein:  This would have been 1934-35 or 1935-36. This still left the problem as to where I should be permanently and the question was put to President Graham to decide. BEGIN SIDE II, TAPE I Graham, who was a man of unusual qualities, said, &quot;It&#x27;s very simple to make this decision.  Who will make him a full professor?&quot;  Chapel Hill said they would make me a full professor beginning with the academic year of 1937.  And, even though State would have been willing to do the same, I opted for Chapel Hill and that&#x27;s the way it came about. S.B.:  Why did you opt for Chapel Hill? Bernstein:  Well, first it had a much better reputation; second, the students were better.  It looked like a place where my future would be brighter.  So I taught at Chapel Hill.  I think some of my students were exceptional.  I&#x27;ve mentioned already that I brought several of them with me to the Treasury, and they didn&#x27;t just do as well as the others already there, they came to the top of the Treasury. S.B.:  Who are you speaking of now? Bernstein:  I&#x27;m talking now about Earl Hicks, who had been my assistant.  The class in money was very large-eighty students.  We divided it into small sections which met one hour a week.  Hicks and I alternated.  The ones he handled one week, I handled the next.  If you take eighty students you can get eight in a group, so each student was in one class of eight and in four classes of eighty weekly. Earl was a very clever fellow.  He used to prepare the ten minute exams and one of his questions was, &quot;In a period of deep depression, a forger who forges excellent notes which pass into circulation has done the community a favor.&quot; Something like that.  The answer had to be yes.  He wouldn&#x27;t take, as the answer, that we ought instead to have the central bank issue the notes, or that maybe the central bank will issue lees, because for some reason money was easier than it had intended.  Hicks wrote a paper for his master&#x27;s degree on Alexander Del Mar, published in the Southern Economic Journal, which was a remarkably good piece of economic theory on money.  He showed that many of the thoughts we accept today were in Alexander Del Mar.  He was a mining engineer and matalist, he was against gold and against silver.  He was the director of the U.S. Statistical Bureau around 1870.  One of his catch phrases was, &quot;The measure of the value of money is all the money.&quot;  It&#x27;s the total supply of money that&#x27;s the measure of the value of money.  He had a theory of interest rates which had a distant resemblance to the physiocrats.  He thought the interest rate was equal to the rate of growth of the whole economy.  If the economy grows at three percent a year (incidently, three percent a year ran through all of his concepts), then three percent is the natural rate of interest.  Something like the physiocrats who would have said that it&#x27;s the rate of growth of trees that determines the rate of interest. S.B.:  Or Irving Fisher. Bernstein:  Yes, well Irving Fisher answered it.  It&#x27;s the rate of interest that determines how long you let the trees grow for lumber.  Incidently, the man who runs the Value Line, Arnold Bernhard, had that theory too:  that the interest rate is determined by the real rate of growth of the economy.  I sent him the Alexander Del Mar paper. S.B.:  Now, Earl Hicks was a graduate student? Bernstein:  A graduate student.  He came from Washington and Lee; he lived in Long Island, in Hicksville. He was brilliant and more intolerant of slow thinking people than I was.  That was true when I brought him to the Treasury and to the International Monetary Fund.  He gave International Financial Statistics a strong monetarist flavor. S.B.:  Did he get that from you? Bernstein:  Yes, he got that from me, but he was even more of a monetarist than I.  I was always a qualified monetarist.  Hicks never qualified anything. S.B.:  Well, I would have thought Hawtrey would have given you a broader approach. Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  I tried to teach money that way. S.B.:  Yes, your book sounds that way too.  Who else? Bernstein:  The other student I brought to the Treasury who became distinguished was John Gunter.  First, we worked together, he and I, on gold and silver.  We&#x27;ll have to come back to why the Treasury hired me as an economist; but we&#x27;re talking about the Chapel Hill students.  Gunter worked on gold and silver with me.  What we were trying to do was to find equations that would explain the behavior of the price of silver, which varied, and the absorption of gold in the arts and industry, and in hoarding, because the price was fixed and it was a question of how much of the supply would be absorbed in the monetary stock and how much by the private sector.  The Bureau of the Mint published an annual report on the production and absorption of gold and silver. After Gunter finished the gold and silver studies, he worked with me on how much inflation we would have during the war. Our approach was that the war was a super-expansion and that prices and wages responded to the expansion.  The effect of the money supply would manifest itself with a delay, and be more significant after the war than during the war.  Our projections stood up very well. S.B.:  He was a good statistical person, it seems. Bernstein:  He was not merely a statistician; he was an econometrician.  And he learned it under Dudley Cowden at Chapel Hill.  He took the courses in money and business cycles with me, but his doctor&#x27;s degree was in econometrics. I brought him to the Treasury because I wanted to introduce econometrics in the analysis of Treasury problems. That is what Gunter did at first.  But then the war came and we had other problems.  One problem was the need for coins by Aramco to pay the workers in the oil fields in Saudi Arabia.  The State Department sent the treasurer of Aramco to me to see what I could suggest.  I saw that the problem was that the rial had too much silver for its dollar value so that it was being exported to India.  I arranged to reduce the silver content and to lend-lease Treasury silver to Saudi Arabia, coining the new rials at our mint in Philadelphia.  We needed the assent of Saudi Arabia to this plan; and I sent Gunter to negotiate an agreement with King Ibn Saud.  This was quite a responsibility for a young man; and Gunter did it very well. After that, he was the Treasury representative in London where he stayed for a year or two.  He came back to the Treasury to become assistant director of the Division of Monetary Research.  And after a few years in that job, he came to the International Monetary Fund to be acting director of the Middle East Department.  He left the Fund a few years ago to become a financial adviser to Saudi Arabia. S.B.:  It pays better I&#x27;m sure! Bernstein:  I think Frank Holzman, who is at Tufts and a specialist on Russia, also worked for me for a brief period, or his wife did. S.B.:  He was in Chapel Hill? Bernstein:  He took his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Chapel Hill, where he was one of my best students.  He was in the U.S. Army in Russia during the war where he was a communications officer and learned Russian.  After the war he went to Harvard and became a Russian expert.  He was the one who reported back to me that Paul Samuelson said that mine was the &quot;best text on money.&quot;  So these are among my Chapel Hill students. S.B.:  These are some of your students.  What about the faculty colleagues you had there.  Were they interesting? Bernstein:  Yes they were good.  Harry Wolf, who came from Chicago and whom I knew at Chicago, was a top-notch man in labor.  Mr. Woosley was very good in banking. S.B.:  Woosley? Bernstein:  Yes, Woosley.  He was very good.  Clsrence Heer was excellent in public finance.  The most distinguished was Zimmerman who was the Kenan professor and a great authority on resources.  He left Chapel Hill to go to Texas.  Spruill gave more of his time to administration, he was a dean, than to the economics department.  Dudley Cowden came after me and he was one of my good friends, and a tennis partner too.  Among the younger people were Evans who left to go to the State Department and became Consul General in Bombay.  Winalow was another very good man who should have been given higher rank. The Dean of business administration and chairman of the economics department was Dudley DeWitt Carroll for whom one of the buildings is named.  He was very interested in getting a good department.  He was fond of me and pushed me for promotion.  I was a very productive writer at Chapel Hill; I used to write a paper or two every year.  Some of them made a lot of sense.  I wrote a paper called, &quot;Wages, Prices and Interest Rates&quot;  for the Journal of Political Economy.  It was one of the few papers that people remembered me for.  When Samuelson first met me he said, &quot;I remember your paper on &#x27;Wages, Prices and Interest Rates.&#x27;&quot; S.B.:  What was the main point there? Bernstein:  The main point was that to encourage investment, the gross return on capital must exceed the gross investment costthat is, interest and depreciation. In a depression, you can get a greater effect on the gross investment cost by a drop in the prices of capital goods than from a reduction in interest rates.  The proper conclusion to that paper should have been that in a great depression we ought to give a subsidy for investment. 26 S.B.:  An investment tax credit? Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  I didn&#x27;t come to that conclusion but that&#x27;s what it all came down to. S.B.:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. Bernstein:  The difficulty in a recession was to get the gross cost of capital down to make the gross return profitable.  The paper was also an argument for taking all the depreciation as expensing.  When I was at the Treasury and Oskar Lange you know him? S.B.:  Yes, oh yes. Bernstein:  Oskar Lange was the Ambassador of Poland. He invited a group of people to a cocktail party and when I went  through the line I said, &quot;My name is Ed Bernstein,&quot; and he said &quot;Are you the author of &quot;Prices, Wages and Interest Rates?&#x27;&quot; daughter]. Well, I loved Chapel Hill, I did.  Now, my wife found it . . . S.B.:  What was it you loved about it, particularly? The students and the faculty colleagues? Bernstein:  Yes, the students and the faculty colleagues were fine, and I played tennis a good deal.  I was a good tennis player in those days.  I was too small to be really very good, but we had tennis all the time in Chapel Hill.  Chapel Hill was noted for its tennis . . . S.B.:  Still is. Bernstein:  . . . not for its football.  Mr. Graham once walked home from a Duke game with Mrs. Bernstein and me and bewailed the fact that we&#x27;d lost once more.  We weren&#x27;t winning games in those days.  I loved Chapel Hill, but my wife was lonely there.  The problem for my wife was that she was twenty-three years old, and much too young to be accepted by the older faculty wives. S.B.:  You had met her . . . where? Bernstein:  I met her through a friend of mine from Harvard.  She went to college at Michigan.  One of her schoolmates had married my friend and so when I came up for a holiday in New York, he arranged for us to go out as a foursome at the Roosevelt Hotel, where you could dine and dance very cheaply, at least it seems so to me now. S.B.:  She was from New York as well? Bernstein:  Yes, she was from New York.  She came to Chapel Hill as a bride wearing bobby socks.  At the age of twenty-three she was the wife of a full professor.  There were associate professors at Chapel Hill who were fifty and fifty-five years old, had children going to college, and had problems with money.  Here we seemed to be living off the fruits of the earth, reaching the top at an early age.  And some of the women didn&#x27;t welcome her the way the faculty welcomed me.  And some of them were proud of their distinguished ancestry.  We had no Revolutionary heroes in our family but we did have some distinguished men.  One of my ancestors, Samuel Edels, wrote the last commentary on the Talmud, published in the standard editions of the Talmud. That was a big achievement.  It even had a Latin name, his commentary, it was called the Novellas, the &quot;new ideas.&quot;  We have a booklet giving that part of our family tree.  In any case, my wife was glad when I came to Washington. When I was in Chapel Hill, Carl Snyder used to come and winter there.  He had been the economic adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  He was a very able but opinionated man.  I had just come back from my honeymoon in the fall of 1936, having passed through from Canada by way of Maine, and Edith and I were in Portland, Maine, when the Republicans were holding a parade for Alf Landon.  So we decided to watch that parade.  Astonishingly, there were very few people in the streets when Alf Landon and his motorcade came through.  When I got to Chapel Hill, having had a wonderful ride down, seeing the colors change from red and yellow in Canada and Maine, and getting green again when we got to Chapel Hill, I met Carl Snyder at a party.  He said he was pretty sure Landon was going to be elected.  I asked him, &quot;Are you going by the Literary Digest Poll?&quot;  He said, &quot;Oh no, that&#x27;s too simple, but the Gallup Poll shows this.&quot;  Well I said, &quot;The Gallup Poll shows Roosevelt leading Landon by a big margin.&quot;  He said, &quot;Ah, but you have to take it by the rate of change in the Gallup Poll.&quot; daughter]  And then he added, &quot; I am convinced that Landon is going to win, and if he doesn&#x27;t win I&#x27;ll give everybody in this room a dinner at the Sir Walter Hotel in Raleigh.&quot; And he did give everybody dinner! daughter] When we came to know each other better, he told me that when he was at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York he had written short notesthree, four, six, and eight pagesthat made a pile a foot high.  Would I be willing to edit them for a book? S.B.:  What did you say? Bernstein:  I said if the fee is high enough I would do it!  So we agreed on two thousand dollars.  Now you must bear in mind that two thousand dollars, if we just go by incomes at Chapel Hill at that time was roughly sixty percent of my salary for a year.  And so I said yes.  My job was to take what he had written, and put together these little pieces so that they formed a good chapter.  I took out his extreme bias but kept his general view, which was very conservative.  His view of the New Deal could almost be summarized as follows:  if President Roosevelt had just changed the gold content of the dollar, it would have been enough.  We wouldn&#x27;t have needed all the other measures which he called nonsense.  There was a point to be made there and I was willing to make it for him.  Snyder was a great believer in inequality; he thought inequality was the law of nature, and what he had in mind was the Pareto curve. So Earl Hicks and I (Earl Hicks got paid separately for being my assistant on this) had to find an explanation of the Pareto curve.  One accepted explanation of the Pareto curve is that it is the normal distribution on a logarithmic base.  I am referring to the distribution of income. 30 S.B.:  Oh, of course. Bernstein:  The Pareto curve gives exceptional rewards for exceptional qualities and Hicks and I thought it would be easier to explain the unequal distribution of these qualities in terms of major league baseball where salaries ranged from $6,000 to 060,000 a year.  Babe Ruth, the highest-paid player, had hit 60 home runs in a season.  We found another player, his name was Johnny Cooney, who had played in the majors for about 20 years and had hit only two home runs in that period.  But he batted .285 and that was good enough to keep him in the big leagues.  Earl Hicks and I decided to construct an equation that would explain the phenomenon of Cooney and Ruth.  We started by assuming that there were a number of qualities that big-league players had to have, but not in equal degree for all players.  The precise number doesn&#x27;t matter, maybe there are three or four.  But differences in the degree of these qualities are of exceptional importance.  Say you have a constant and then you have *A&#x27;, *B&#x27;, *C, %D&#x27;--the extraordinary qualities and each of these qualities has an exponent which measures the degree of the quality.  An equation of this kind results in very sharp differences with a normal distribution of the qualities and the exponents.  We succeeded in duplicating the Pareto curve with four factors and three exponents, plus a constant.  I have no doubt that this is the explanation of the Pareto curve. S.B.:  Now, is this only the distribution of earnings you&#x27;re talking about or the distribution of income? Bernstein:  Well, we&#x27;re talking about the distribution of abilities which result in the unequal distribution of income. S.B.:  You know the distinction, of course. Bernstein:  I&#x27;m not quite sure. S.B.:  Income is going to include inherited wealth as opposed to earnings which would be . . . Bernstein:  Oh yes, of course, you are right.  We didn&#x27;t make that distinction.  I think we just took what we had on the Pareto curve which was on income.  These are the statistics I had. S.B.:  Right, right.  So, this was the sort of person you were running into while you were there? Bernstein:  Yes.  Later this book became a big hit. S.B.:  The book by Snyder? Bernstein:  Called Capitalism and the Creator.  Wilkie carried it during the campaign against Roosevelt in 1940. S.B.:  Was your name on the book? Bernstein:  No, he offered it, but I couldn&#x27;t do that as it did not represent my views. S.B.:  I didn&#x27;t think you would want, perhaps . . . Bernstein:  But I was perfectly willing to have a statement in the book acknowledging my help.  I didn&#x27;t take responsibility for the views nor did Hicks, who worked with me on it.  I was doing well at Chapel Hill, people were getting to know me, and in 1940 I suddenly got several invitations to come to work in Washington. S.B.:  Nineteen forty was, I suppose, when people were beginning to assume we were going to be involved in the war. Bernstein:  Yes, or at least let me put it this way: the war was getting to be a big consideration in all policy. S.B.:  Had you been writing anything in that area particularly? Bernstein:  Yes, I had written a paper, which is still very good by the way, &quot;War and the Pattern of Business Cycles.&quot;  That paper is important because it may be the first time that anybody discussed the Kondratieff long waves analytically instead of just assuming these things happen. Kondratieff himself said he didn&#x27;t know the explanation of this.  So &quot;War and the Pattern of Business Cycles&quot; was, I think, a very useful paper.  It also took up a question now very important, whether the inflation of the Napoleonic Wars was due to the fact that the government ran a deficit or someting else. Tooke said it couldn&#x27;t have been due to the deficit because after all, if the government borrowed the money, the government spent it instead of somebody else spending it.  You get the same arguments today.  I quoted Pigou on that.  Pigou said that in time of war, the public don&#x27;t want military expenditures in place of civil expenditures; they want both.  That paper, I think, made an impression; certainly the last part which had to do with what would happen after World War II.  I was explaining the Great Depression in what is now accepted language, I think. In fact when Haberler wrote a paper for the Joint Economic Committee on the 50th anniversary of the Great Depression he accepted my explanation as the proper one.  And this is where I first gave it, though I repeated it in several places.  One was in the EMB series and was called &quot;The Nature and Causes of the Deep Depression.&quot;  Another is an article I wrote for the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. In that article I have several paragraphs discussing the relationship of gold to great depressions. S.B.:  So this work, it attracted notice . . . Bernstein:  Actually Harry White may have been teaching while he was at the Treasury to earn a little extra money, and he may have been using my book.  But, in any case, I got an invitation from the Treasury by telegraph. S.B.:  Directly from White, or one of his . . . Bernstein:  No, from the Undersecretary of the Treasury. S.B.:  Who was . . . Bernstein:  Daniel Bell, a very good friend of mine later. This telegram was read to me over the telephone (it was May of 1940), and it asked me whether I could come to Washington right away.  And so when my wife came home I told her, and she said, &quot;Sure, let&#x27;s go for the summer.&quot; Actually, the Treasury was offering me a temporary job for the summer.  After I was at the Treasury, I got an invitation then from Galbraith to join him.  I&#x27;ve forgotten what he was working on, but it was probably the OPA.  So when I came to the Treasury, Mr. White explained what he wanted.  We rented a house in Kalorama Road, and we brought up some furniture for our child.  And we also brought our servant from Chapel Hill, so that we would all feel at home--especially the baby. S.B.:  Just for the summer? Bernstein:  Yes, just for the summer.  But we took enough of his furniture so he would feel at home.  We were well settled and I went to work.  What the Treasury wanted was this:  In 1940 the Senate had passed a resolution called Senate Resolution 40, introduced by Senator Wagner, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  It was a questionnaire on why the Administration followed certain monetary policies. There were questions on gold, on silver, on foreign exchange, on domestic questions and so on and so on.  This questionnaire was prepared by Viner and Hardy.  You remember Hardy? S.B.:  C. L. Hardy. Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right, Charles L. Hardy.  He wrote a book called Do We Have Enough Gold? published by Brookings. This was a very good questionnaire and it went to the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the American Bankers Association and others.  White said to me, &quot;You are going to take charge of the answers.&quot;  And I had a small office, about the size of this, and a typewriter, because I like to do my work on the typewriter.  And I sat at the Treasury for three months and answered those questions.  I wrote a volume on monetary policy that summer.  The only instruction the Treasury gave me was that everything the Administration did, was well thought out.  If something went wrong, it was because of unforeseen circumstances. S.B.:  So how did they receive ... you said it came to a volume? Bernstein:  It came to a volume because there were roughly a hundred and sixty questions and if I wrote three or four pages on each, double spaced, you would have had around six hundred pages of manuscript.  By the time the answers were sent to the Senate Committee, it decided that it had other more urgent problems.  The answers prepared by the Treasury never got to be printed.  And so they remained manuscript documents in the Treasury. When I finished answering these questions, I delivered the volume to Mr. White, and told him that I would leave in a few days. &#x27; This must have been around September 15th.  He asked why I was leaving.  I said, &quot;I have to go back to teach, I have classes and you hired me just for the summer. He said, &quot;We hire everybody just for the summer, then if we don&#x27;t want them we can let them go.  But we have no intention. . . .  You&#x27;re good.&quot;  And I said, &quot;You hadn&#x27;t told me that you wanted me to stay, so I have to make arrangements if I am to stay.&quot; S.B.:  He must have had a lot of other things on his mind. Bernstein:  Who, White? He just assumed that I was staying on.  Once he&#x27;d made the decision in his own mind, he didn&#x27;t think he had to communicate with me.  Well, we got Dean Carroll to come here to discuss my situation with the Treasury.  He was very understanding and so was Bob House who was the second man at Chapel Hill.  At the Treasury, I had a small staff to work on gold, silver, foreign exchange and Federal Reserve policy. S.B.:  And you were an assistant director at that point to whom? Bernstein:  No, I was just a principal economist. S.B.:  O.k.  And there would have been some other economists as well, at that time, up there? Bernstein:  Oh yes, there were others, some of them quite good.  The staff was very small and White asked me to hire anyone I needed.  And so that fall I brought Earl Hicks and John Gunter, my best graduate students, from Chapel Hill to the Treasury.  The next big change for me came in January, 1941, when White called a meeting of the staff and informed us that he had decided to name two additional assistant directors of monetary research--he had one at the time.  He told the staff that he had chosen Frank Southard and me.  Southard was a professor at Cornell.  He had come to the Treasury in September, probably because he had a summer school course.  White never asked me whether I wanted the appointment.  He spoke about the new problems that the Treasury would have to deal with because of the war.  He parcelled out these problems among the assistant directors. I was given the inflation problem and White explained how he wanted the study made.  As we left the meeting, I told the first asistant director ... S.B.:  Who was that? Bernstein:  Frank Coe, I told him that what Mr. White was talking about was just peripherally related to inflation.  Coe said to me, &quot;Do it your own way.&quot;  And so I started a study on how much inflation we would have if we went to war.  John Gunter helped me with it.  I have to tell you how we did this.  What we did was to project what would happen to the GNP in different sectors.  I then assumed that the behavior of the economy was a super-boom.  And I asked the question how much of a rise in prices did we normally get cyclically, especially when we were recovering from the recessions of 1933 and 1937.  And I came to the conclusion that for every two or three percent (somewhere between there) increase in industrial production, we would get a one percent rise in the wholesale price index.  And we concluded that that rise would be due to the increase in wages and the increase in raw materials&#x27; prices.  We assumed that the role of money during the war would not be of great importance because of all the controls we would have.  At this time Milton Friedman was brought in by Roy Blough to work on the same question with Professor Shoup of Columbia.  Shoup was pressing for more taxes, and Friedman was going to project the amount of inflation.  And he came to the conclusion that the inflation would be eight-fold during the war. S.B.:  Eight times the price level! Bernstein:  Eight hundred from a hundred.  He also projected the GNP to rise to a thousand billion dollars, though I didn&#x27;t remember that.  Bob Mayo reminded me of it a few years ago.  He was a junior member of the Treasury staff in 1941, who later became the budget director under Nixon, and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Of course, we didn&#x27;t really get to a GNP of a thousand billion dollars until 1971, and we needed the six years of Vietnam inflation for that.  The technique that Friedman used to project the inflation was simple.  He assumed, probably really roughly correctly, what the budget deficit would be.  He then assumed that a very high part of it would be financed by the banks and the Federal Reserve and concluded that prices would rise proportionately, adjusted for the increase in output.  That gave him an eight-fold increase.  I thought the large rise in prices would come after the war, that during the war we&#x27;d have 33 percent rise in the wholesale price index. S.B.:  Now, you were assuming price controls and Friedman was not, evidently. Bernstein: That&#x27;s right. Even if we didn&#x27;t have price controls, we would have had to have rationing because of the scarcity of many consumer goods.  And we would have had to have allocation of materials to make sure that the war industries were not hampered in their production.  So that even without price controls, personal saving and business saving would be at very much higher than pre-war rates. Actually, I believed that price controls had a function in time of war and that function was to prevent prices from rising in response to temporary shortages and to prevent wages from trying to keep up with such price rises.  After World War I, the wartime inflation was followed by a sharp deflation because gold reserves were not adequate to sustain the higher level of prices.  The theme of my paper on wartime inflation was that prices would rise only because of the higher prices of raw materials and wages. S.B.:  The costs. Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  There&#x27;d be a cost inflation but not a scarcity inflation.  Well, about twenty years later I was on a program with Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago and Milton said how glad he was to see his old colleague, Eddie Bernstein.  &quot;We worked on inflation together during World War II, but unfortunately we were wrong.&quot;  daughter]  In any case, my paper was a great hit at the Treasury in 1941.  It helped our division establish a reputation for commonsense economics compared to the division of Tax Research and Research and Statistics, the other two research divisions.  White was very grateful to me for the inflation study.  He was an appreciative division head until we had some differences on policy in 1944.  The Secretary of the Treasury was given three studies of inflationone by me with a projected 33 per cent increase in wholesale prices, one by Friedman with an eightfold rise in prices, and another by Murray Shields with a sixfold rise in prices.  Shields had been brought in from the Irving Trust Company as an inflation adviser to the division of Research and Statistics.  I am going to use some four letter words; is that all right? S.B.:  That&#x27;s o.k., sure. Bernstein:  We had these three inflation projections with an unbelievable range.  Mr. Morgenthau, the Secretary of the Treasury, called a meeting to which White and I came. White had just told me how glad ha was that I had done this study with John Gunter, and how wonderful it was to have a report that didn&#x27;t just project a couple of numbers but analyzed the inflation problem.  It was a large meeting with people from all the war agencies who came to hear the Treasury discuss inflation.  Friedman and Shields showed how they had projected the inflation.  Actually, Shields&#x27; was the same as Friedman&#x27;s, with slightly different projections of the deficit and the amount of financing by the banks and the Federal Reserve.  Essentially, he also set up a table showing the growth of the money supply and the proportionate rise of prices, adjusted for the increase in output.  The Secretary said to White, &quot;Look at these projections.&quot;  White said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any merit in them at all.&quot;  So the Secretary said to Mr. White, &quot;Oh Harry, you always think that if it isn&#x27;t done by your shop, it isn&#x27;t any good.&quot; White replied, &quot;Shit.&quot;  daughter]  The Secretary, who was a very prim man, said, &quot;Harry, if you can&#x27;t talk decently, you&#x27;d better leave the room.&quot;  So White went out of the room and I stayed behind.  I then explained to the Secretary our point of view.  After the meeting, I went out to see White to report what had happened.  He was weeping.  White had a short temper, and he was easily upset by the Secretary of the Treasury because he depended for his influence on his close relationship with the Secretary.  And though it was unfair to say that White wouldn&#x27;t have appreciated a good piece of economics done by the other divisions, still he shouldn&#x27;t have used that language at a meeting with outsiders in the Secretary&#x27;s office.  White and I used to go together to the Secretary&#x27;s conference.  I&#x27;d whisper to White what was the really essential point the Secretary ought to emphasize. S.B.:  This was a weekly meeting of some kind? Bernstein:  Weekly, yes.  He said to me, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just speak up?&quot;  At that time I was a bashful fellow.  At Chapel Hill I never spoke at faculty meetings.  I didn&#x27;t even speak much in the meeting of the department.  Maybe I wasn&#x27;t interested in what they were discussing at the faculty meeting, which was, quite often the Graham plan for getting professionals out of college football.  At the department meeting a lot of the discussion was about the graduate courses.  There, I did speak up on the quality of the graduate students and the courses.  At the Treasury, White was always very appreciative of my technical ability and the general rule was, if we had a problem, give it to Bernstein.  In addition to my other duties, in this way, I became the economist for Foreign Funds Control, which supervised foreign transactions during the war.  When the Bretton Woods discussions began, naturally the economic analysis was turned over to me. S.B.:  Well, but before that, the war broke out in December ... Bernstein:  Well, I&#x27;ll tell you what I was working on then.  When the war broke out in December 1941 I was given the job, among other things (I was still in charge of everything I had been doing before), of economic adviser to foreign funds control.  Foreign funds control was our exchange control.  I was acting director of the exchange stabilization fund.  I can tell you little anecdotes if they&#x27;re of interest. S.B.:  Yes! Bernstein:  In the foreign funds control, the big job for me began in June, 1941.  That was one year exactly after I came to the Treasury.  The Treasury, the President I should say, decided to freeze the use of dollars by every country in the world under the Trading With the Enemy Act. S.B.:  Before the war. Bernstein:  Before we were in the war.  We&#x27;d already applied it to Denmark, Norway and France as they were invaded by Germany.  Now, in June, 1941, we applied it to every country in the world with the exceptions of the British Commonwealth and Latin America, but we had a black list of Latin American firms who were included in the freeze.  Even Russia was covered by it, and Russia was Invaded that same week.  Nevertheless, Russia was covered by it although there couldn&#x27;t have been many assets the Germans could have seized, like gold and foreign exchange.  In other places, the Germans had siezed the gold reserves and with the control of the banks and business firms in the occupied countries they could have seized their dollars.  Now under the Trading With the Enemy Act, no American including U.S. banks and business firms, could make any payment or engage in a transaction with a resident of any country under the Foreign Funds Control except by a license.  Furthermore, a bank was considered as engaging in a transaction if it executed an order of a person in a frozen country to transfer funds.  We had all sorts of unusual transactions coming up, and I enjoyed sitting with the committee on Foreign Funds Control.  John Pehle, my friend and colleague, a lawyer, was asistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, and director of the Foreign Funds Control, with an interdepartmental board on policy divisions. S.B.:  And you were an adviser to that group? Bernstein: I was an adviser to Foreign Funds Control and I sat with the interdepartmental board. The board consisted of Ed Foley, who was the General Counsel of the Treasury, as chairman; Dean Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State, as the second man; and Francis Shea, Assistant Attorney General, as the third. It was a great education to sit with the Board when they discussed such sensitive questions as what do we do about Japanese ships coming to San Francisco who want to buy oil, and similar problems involving other countries. At the time we extended the Foreign Funds Control in June 1941, the Treasury also decided to take a census of foreign-owned property in the United States. The man we chose to supervise it was a long time civil servant, but he didn&#x27;t know how to go about it, although we had hired him especially for this. So at the last minute I was brought in to supervise the census. First I had to decide what we wanted to know about the foreign-owned property and who would have to report it. I had to devise the forms and to consult with the banks and business firms on what we expected them to do. It was a dual reporting system. A resident of the United States had to report any foreign owned property that he held. The banks had to report deposits and custody accounts. Companies had to report the stocks and bonds that they issued if they were registered in the name of a nonresident. And people who had come to the United States from countries covered  by the  freezing order  were regarded  as under the Foreign Funds Control and they had to report for themselves, so we had to bring all these things together. John Gunter became my assistant on collecting and collating the census reports, so that I didn&#x27;t have to spend all my time on that. But, after a time I had to give up the work on foreign funds control because Bretton Woods was taking most of my time. Well, work on Bretton Woods began in December, 1941, just after Pearl Harbor, with a short memorandum by Harry White.S.B: That soon? Bernstein: Yes, I&#x27;ll tell you what happened. In December, 1941, the State Department decided that because we were at war, we had to have a meeting of the ministers of foreign affairs of the American Republics. And we called the conference to meet around January 20, 1942 in Rio de Janeiro. At this conference Sumner Wells was our principal representative. Of course, he was an expert on Latin America besides being the actual working head of the State Department. He wanted to propose a resolution that the Latin American countries would support. Harry White was one of the delegates. He proposed a resolution that the American Republics recommend that an International Stabilization Fund be established after the war by the United Nations and Associated Nations. The resolution was about five  lines.   The text of the resolution is published in the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for the fiscal year ending June, 1942. S.B.:  Yes. Bernstein: White wrote a short memorandum of about four or five pages, in which he suggested that we make such a proposal. The concept of an International Stabilization Fund to advance reserve credit wasn&#x27;t itself novel, though the idea of making it universal was. Our own Exchange Stabilization Fund was already operating selling dollars for national currencies under repurchase agreements. It took in cruzeiros from Brazil, for example, and gave them dollars to be repaid in a short term. I had proposed, in Money and the Economic System, that if a country wanted to have an undervalued currency in order to get the employment benefits of increased exports, the least it could do to avoid too much deflation in other countries, was to hold the currency of the other country, instead of requiring it to be converted into gold. That concept is, of course, the way the International Monetary Fund operates today. S.B.: That&#x27;s something like a multiple reserve set-up, isn&#x27;t it? Bernstein: It could turn out to be that way, with the United States itself holding the currencies of other countries. If the dollar was undervalued, then obviously, that would give the United States a competitive advantage in world trade and we would run a balance of payments surplus. S.B.:  While we accumulate claims on foreigners. Bernstein: Now, there are two effects that has. One effect, of course, is the direct employment effect through exports and imports. S.B.:  Mm-hm. Bernstein: The second one is the monetary deflation effect through the settlement, if you have a system under which the country with the deficit has to deflate to the same extent that it loses gold, or some other reserve asset. And I was proposing in Money and the Economic System that instead of claiming gold in settlements, we should extend reserve credit to the deficit countries by acquiring their curency. And, of course, that&#x27;s actually the way the International Monetary Fund works. It tskes in the currency of the deficit country and it gives them dollars or some other currency to settle their payments. That was the concept that White proposed for an International Stabilization Fund. S.B.: Well, was this a bee that you put in White&#x27;s ear? Bernstein: The broad concept of providing reserve credit during the Great Depression was not novel. Keynes proposed the issue of gold notes in The Means to Prosperity in 1933. The proposal for an International Stabilization Fund and the principles that it would embody were all originated by Harry White. In a number of places Keynes suggested that I was the author, but that&#x27;s not correct. As I wrote  to Keynes,  I was just a Levite serving the priests in their holy work. In any case, the proposal started with White&#x27;s short memorandum in December, 1941. Then White began to give flesh to his proposals. By 1942, he had written a volume in which he proposed not only the Fund, but also the World Bank. S.B.:  This was a project within the Treasury. Bernstein:  That&#x27;s right.  Nobody else was in onit. S.B.: O.k., he was the director of the thinghe was the initiator of it.  Who was working on it, then? Bernstein: Well, at that stage, I was the only one working with him, although by the end of 1942 I had about five economists to help us. S.B.: O.k. And you worked out these ideas according to his proposals, basically . . . Bernstein: Yes. And then we wrote a simple summary of the plan in the form of articles. Each country would have a quota, paying some of it in gold; it would declare a par value for its currency; it could draw on its quota, and so on. S.B.: This was being fleshed out in 1942, is that right? Bernstein: That&#x27;s right, 1942. Now, let me give you the stages. The first one is December 1941, leading to the resolution at Rio. S.B.: January of &#x27;42, I thought you said. Bernstein: January of &#x27;42 is the date of the Rio resolution.   It was December of &#x27;41 by White, five pages or so. Then the next stage is a large volume discussing the Fund and the Bank. That would have been written in early 1942 and perhaps revised later in the year. And then we issued a short document called &quot;The Treasury&#x27;s Proposal for an International Stabilization Fund.&quot; That&#x27;s a ten or twelve page document printed and issued by the Treasury. At about the same time came the Keynes Plan. S.B.: The one you just spoke of would have been what&#x27;s called the White Plan. Bernstein: Right. Then the Keynes Plan came to us, and it was a shorter memorandum, not quite as full as it later was. And I asked Gardner Patterson to analyze it. You know Gardner Patterson? S.B.:  Oh yes, certainly. Bernstein: Well, Gardner embraced it heart and soul, and I had to tell him we couldn&#x27;t use his memorandum. We needed a plan which required two things: first, it had to have limited liability on the extension of credit by the Un i ted States. Under the Keynes Plan, the United States would initially have had a potential obligation to extend twenty-six billion dollars in reserve credit if all other countries drew dollars.  And if the original Keynes formula were applied now, the total quotas of other countries would now be about 2,500 billion dollars. The second fault was that the Keynes Plan did not require much discipline by other countries.  Most of the discipline he had in mind was on the United States as a creditor country.  We had this problem in negotiating with a number of countries, especially the Australians, who wanted the United States to guarantee there would be no postwar depression.  The concept that we need discipline on the deficit country to correct balance of payments deficits seemed to be lacking, at least in any strong form.  Their deficits could run on and on, financed by credit from the Fund. S.B.:  The idea that was in the White Plan was that the Fund would be an arrangement to help exchange assets, but would be self-financing in a sense.  Is that right? Bernstein:  No.  The Fund would give each country the currency it needed to meet its deficit and the country would give its currency to the Fund.  But then it would be obligated to repay the money it drew and it had to begin to correct its balance of payments.  In the Keynes Plan there was no obligation to repay unless it developed a balance of payments surplus.  The main point was that we wanted conditions attached to the use of the Fund&#x27;s resources by the deficit countries.  We weren&#x27;t going to give countries money and say, &quot;You can do as you please with it.&quot;  Second, there had to be a limit to how much money the United States would advance to the deficit countries:  In the White Plan the limit was very clear.  If we subscribe two billion dollars to the International Monetary Fund, then that&#x27;s all the Fund can lend in dollars from our subscription.  If the Fund wants more, it would ask us, and the Fund would have to ask us for permission to borrow from anybody else.  But there was no obligation in the White Plan to give the Fund any more than our original subscription.  And that was what we wanted.  So I wrote a memorandum on the Keynes Plan that made these two points:  We need limited liability, and we need discipline. Once the papers on the White and Keynes Plans were exchanged between the British and us, an effort was made by each side to have its plan the basis for discussion.  Keynes and White were very proud of their plans and they wanted the discussions to start with their own plans.  The first suggestion by the British was to discuss the Keynes Plan for exchange rates and reserve credit, and the White Plan for the bank for reconstruction and development.  I suggested to White not to discuss the Bank at all until we were sure we had an agreement on the Fund.  And that&#x27;s the way it went. The notes went back and forth between the British and us. We would ask the British questions in writingand they would reply; they would ask us questions, and we would reply. S.B.:  This would have been during 1943? Bernstein: 1943, yes. And during 1943 Keynes came over for a meeting of the U.S. and U.K. economists. At one meeting the British had Keynes, and Robertson, probably Meade and Redvers Opie, and no doubt a few others. We had about  ten   people.    White  was  sick,  Berle,  Assistant Secretary of State, presided. Berle was originally in charge for the State Department and when he left to become Ambassador to Brazil, Acheson took over. At this time in 1943, Berle was the State Department representative and as White was ill, he presided and I was the spokesman for the Treasury. Keynes opened the meeting by saying, &quot;We are prepared to take the plan as you have written it, but want to rewrite it in terms of bancor.&quot; Bancor was a unit of account in the Keynes Plansomething like the SDR today, except it was defined as the SDR was originally, in terms of gold. Incidentally, in order to make the White Plan more acceptable to the British we took some ideas from the Keynes Plan and put them into revised versions of the White Plan. I think it helped our discussions for the British to see that we were incorporating parts of the Keynes Plan in our plan. CEND OF SIDE I, TAPE III Bernstein: Now, at this meeting in 1943, Keynes announced that they were prepared to accept the plan as White had revised it, but they would like to rewrite it in bancor. I had to talk for the Treasury. I asked, &quot;If you are prepared to accept the plan, what&#x27;s the need to rewrite it?&quot; Keynes answered, &quot;Because your plan is written in Cherokee.&quot; I am sure it wasn&#x27;t written in as elegant a style as the Keynes Plan, but the Treasury was more concerned with substance than with style. So I said, &quot;The reason it&#x27;s in Cherokee is because we need the support of the braves of Wall Street and this is the language they understand.&quot;  Keynes became nasty to me at this meeting. S.B.:  In what particular form? Bernstein: He said it was just ignorance on my part not to recognize how much better it would be if the White Plan were rewritten in his terms--bancor. S.B.:  So, it became a little personal in some sense? Bernstein: Yes. I didn&#x27;t realize it was as personal as it was because I was so occupied with defending the White Plan. After the meeting, Dennis Robertson, who was stationed here permanently, . . . S.B:  At the Treasury or at the Embassy? Bernstein: At the Embassy as the British Treasury representative. S.B.:  So in the memoranda exchange he must have been . Bernstein: That&#x27;s right. He was the one who was exchanging notes with me. He and Redvers Opie. After the meeting, Robertson (Keynes knew that Robertson and I were good friends) came up to me and thanked me for not replying to Keynes in the kind of language he used to me. After that, Keynes and I got along very well, and the British looked to me to safeguard their position on other matters, particularly the loan after the war. S.B.: Of course, he knew the United States was in a much stronger economic position at that point, and perhaps he was feeling a little amiss . . . Bernstein: Yes, he knew that in the end we could do as we pleased. S.B.:  And that didn&#x27;t please him. Bernstein:  No, not a bit. S.B.:  I&#x27;m sure. Bernstein: I didn&#x27;t really know how hard he took this meeting. Later when his collected papers were published, Walter Salant pointed out to me the Keynes report of this meeting. And what Keynes said was that I was a &quot;ghetto rat,&#x27; brilliant, no doubt, but unwilling to listen to reason. To tell the truth, if the Treasury had known he had written a memorandum like that, we would not have held any more discussions with him. The Secretary of the Treasury would definitely have said he wouldn&#x27;t have it. There were critical remarks in one or two later memoranda. But after Bretton Woods  he began  to speak of how well I had done and how helpful the report I- had written for the Senate Banking Committee would be later on the British loan. Keynes blamed me for the opposition to the Clearing Union, and it suited White to have him think that. S.B.: But after this meeting, you went back and redrafted the White Plan. Bernstein: Oh, yes, we made some changes. But we certainly didn&#x27;t change the substance of our plan. S.B.:  You didn&#x27;t rewrite the whole thing. Bernstein: We didn&#x27;t take the Cherokee out! daughter] It stayed in Cherokee. Keynes had the strange notion that if it were not for me, he would have his way in the discussions. He would go to White and say he would like certain changes. And White, who didn&#x27;t like to argue with Keynes and wasn&#x27;t well anyway (he died only five or six years later)--would say, &quot;Maybe you&#x27;re right, but I can&#x27;t get Bernstein to agree, and if he doesn&#x27;t agree, then we can&#x27;t do it.&quot;  daughter]  And Keynes really believed that! Then he went to the Federal Reserve (this is all in his papers) and they told him that they really supported him, but they couldn&#x27;t resist the Treasury. There&#x27;s no bigger piece of nonsense than that. The Federal Reserve had proposed that all countries surrender their gold to the new Fund. One of the big objections the British had to the White Plan was the need to subscribe gold. We felt the new Fund should have some subscriptions in gold from other countries as  it would  increase the  liquidity of the Fund. But the British were against this; they didn&#x27;t want to surrender any gold. Keynes as usual had a clever line to make his point. He said that the United States, having accumulated all the gold that the deficit countries had, was proposing a plan by which it would get all the gold that the surplus countries had.  Well, of course, that&#x27;s not true. S.B.:  It was supposed to go to the Fund. Bernstein: That&#x27;s right. The gold would go to the Fund. But Keynes identified the Fund with the U.S. Treasury. Others had the same notion. The upshot of all this was that Keynes kept thinking that I was the one who prevented his plan from being adopted. Nothing could be farther from the the truth--I was only one of many who opposed it. S.B.: You were simply pointing out the points of the Keynes Plan that were not in agreement with U.S. interests, and then everyone in the Government was agreeing with you, in a sense. Bernstein: That&#x27;s right, those who counted were agreeing with me. Most important. White was agreeing with me. I&#x27;ll put it another way: White was looking to me to come up with reasons why we shouldn&#x27;t take the Keynes Plan. Remember, there was an enormous amount of pride on each side in getting its plan across. S.B.: And Keynes had a tremendous reputation at the time, too. Bernstein: Oh, yes. And you must bear in mind too, that the British were well aware that we could have our way no matter what. I forgot to mention to you that White was a little anti-British, and it appears in a lot of places. When the Lend-Lease Resolution (HR-1776, that&#x27;s the name for the Lend-Lease) was adopted . . . Morgenthau said that he was going to make sure that the British sell every asset they have to pay for their military equipment from the United States, before we give them Lend-Lease. S.B.: You had to satisfy Congress, which was after blood. Bernstein: We still had a lot of isolationists remember. Well, he promised this. We set up a group to monitor the British payments, and I designated Earl Hicks to be in charge. I was going to keep control of it. I didn&#x27;t just trust Hicks, I loved him. And he would do what I suggested. So we were monitoring the British dollar position. The truth of the matter is that the Treasury was not getting the information because of a technical gap in the capital movement figures.  You know the series. S.B.:  Oh yes, sure. Bernstein: The banking reports. I had to reform them. We weren&#x27;t using the right definition to get the British and the French dollar holdings. Nearly all of the official dollar assets of the British and the French had been transferred to a Joint Purchasing Commission. As the Commission  had  a  U.S.  address,  its  holdings  were  not reported by the banks as foreign-owned assets. I changed the definition so that dollars held by foreign diplomatic missions and trade missions were reported by the banks on form B. That gave us the information we needed  how much money they had in all of those accounts. Bernstein: Well, we finally got everything agreed, and prepared a Joint Statement of Experts which we invited other countries to accept. We had tried to give the White Plan a multilateral flavor by holding a meeting with eighteen countries at the Treasury. S.B.:  Was this the Savannah meeting? Bernstein: No, we haven&#x27;t gotten that far just yet. We&#x27;re still in 1943. S.B.: Can you clarify what you meant by saying that White was a bit anti-British? Bernstein: Well, I&#x27;ll give you several of his statements later, particularly on the British Loan. Continuing on the Fund, we got the Joint Statement of Experts out. After that, we invited 44 countries to a conference at Bretton Woods. Before the conference began on July 1, 1944, we held a preparatory meeting in Atlantic City at which we agreed on what would be presented at Bretton Woods. It was agreed that the conference would have alternative statements on what to put into the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. We had an agreement on the World Bank but we were not sure whether there was sufficient support to take it up at Bretton Woods. At Atlantic City, the British and the European governments in exile informed us that they would support a bank if its lending power was limited to its subscribed capital: That meant that the United States and the other rich countries would be able to make good any losses from defaults of borrowers.  There wouldn&#x27;t be any loss to the investors. On the Fund, we were going to leave it to the conference to make certain decisions, by choosing among alternatives that did not differ much on the most important provisions. First, we had a statement taken from the Joint Statement of Principles. Then we would have the text the Americans proposedalternative *A&#x27;. Then the text the British proposedalternative *B&#x27;. If anyone else proposed something different, we put it in as alternative &quot;C. The purpose in Atlantic City was to agree on a series of proposals so the Conference would know the general shape of what it was to do, but would have, still, the right to choose among alternatives. S.B.:  Do you mean Savannah?  Or Atlantic City? Bernstein: This is Atlantic City. Savannah comes in 1946. Still, there was room for sharp disagreement. When we issued the White Plan in 1943, White and I held a press conference at the Treasury. We had about one hundred and fifty reporters from all over the world, and White explained what we proposed to do and undertook to answer questions. One question was, what will the quotas be for the United States, the  British, the  Chinese and  the Russians.  Well, White said, having given what the United States would have, he said, &quot;Well, maybe for the Russians we&#x27;ll have 1 billion, and for the Chinese 800 million&quot;I am not sure of the precise figures, but they are not essential. The minute White said this I Knew that it was a mistake. So I said to White, &quot;Tell them that this is merely illustrative and that it will all depend upon how large the Fund is.&quot; I was afraid the Russians would take this as a commitment and try to bargain up from there. In the preliminary discussions the Russians had been non-communicative. Gromyko was the Russian ambassador. In 1943, he came in with the Russian representatives to talk to White and me. He told White, &quot;They are the ones who will be our observers at these discussions. They&#x27;ll ask you questions.&quot; Then, as we were finishing, he turned to his Russians and said, &quot;Remember! You are observers. You are not to give any opinion of any kind.&quot; That&#x27;s the way we had to deal with the Russians on Bretton Woods. Now we get back to Bretton Woods. We&#x27;ve finished at Atlantic City, we&#x27;ve agreed on the documents to be presented  all in there in that big volume, and now we are meeting. The conference was organized into two main commissions, I on the Fund and II on the Bank. Morgenthau was chairman of the general conference. White was chairman of Commission I; Keynes was chairman of Commission II; There was also a third Commission for other resolutions. As White presided in Commission I, he couldn&#x27;t act as spokesman for the U.S. delegation, so that fell to me. Incidentally, I was named Executive Secretary of the U.S. Delegation at the suggestion of Acheson. He said, &quot;We need somebody with authority to be Executive Secretary of the Delegation. If someone wants to see the Americans and he can&#x27;t see the Secretary, and he can&#x27;t see White, we can give him to Bernstein.&quot; And so that&#x27;s the title I got. Executive Secretary and Chief Technical Advisor of the U.S. Delegation. I had a formidable group of advisors. I had Hansen, from Harvard, Upgren from Minnesota, Angel1 from Columbia. I held meetings with them every morning and gave them instructions on what to do at the committee meeting. The American delegation consisted of 12 delegates, and Ansel Luxford, who was Chief Legal Advisor, and I, who was Chief Technical Advisor and Executive Secretary of the Delegation. S.B.:  Were there some confrontations? Bernstein: Yes, there were several confrontations. The first was with the Russians who complained that the committee on quotas had failed to give them the quota they had been promised. I think the committee assigned them a quota of SOO million. First, the Russians protested to the Secretary of the Treasury that Harry White had misled them. S.B.: Was this to do with that press conference remark? Bernstein: Oh sure. So the Secretary took me and a Russian expert  from the  State Department--later  he was an ambassador to Russia--to see the Russians. The complaint of the Russians was that Harry White had now proposed to give them a quota of eight hundred million dollars, and they had every reason to believe that the quota should be much more than that. The Secretary asked me, &quot;What&#x27;s all this based on?&quot; I said I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what the Russians had in mind; they hadn&#x27;t mentioned the press conference. I said, &quot;White may have mentioned that a quota of a billion dollars wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable for Russia, but he may have been talking about a Fund which was fifty percent larger than the one we are setting up today.&quot; I wasn&#x27;t going to tell the Secretary that White had made this tactical slip. The Russians entered a formal protest and we raised their quota in the Fund to 1.2 billion. The conference really went very well. I was the spokesman for the United States on everything on the International Monetary Fund. I had a good sense of what Europeans, for example, were interested in. They wanted to know what would happen to their subscriptions if the Fund was liquidated. I had the same interest. At every stage I had in mind that if the Fund plan didn&#x27;t work, the United States might want to get out. And if it gets out, we want to go out with dignity, without loss, or at least a minimum loss. And I also wanted the others to feel that we&#x27;re being fair. So I drafted the original liquidation provisions and withdrawal provisions.  The Belgians, who later provided the first managing director, wanted slightly different provisions. Our original proposal for liquidation provided that if a country withdrew, it would get back its own subscription. If the Fund was liquidated and there were losses, then the losses would be borne in proportion to the subscriptions. The Belgians said that meant that if they had no cumulative deficit, if they never borrowed from the Fund, they would have to pay part of the losses. I asked them what alternative they would suggest. They said, &quot;The surplus countries, who are the true lenders, whose currencies are being lent, should bear the loss.&quot; Well, I thought it over and I said, &quot;All right, even though we expect to be the surplus country, we&#x27;ll share the losses. Half will be borne by the subscribers, where we were roughly thirty percent, and half by the surplus countries, where we might be fifty percent or more.&quot; But my point was, I wanted the other countries to see that we were fair, and this counted for a lot without any risk for us. S.B.:  You mentioned Monnet earlier. Bernstein: I&#x27;ll come to that. At this moment, we did get through the Bretton Woods Conference. There were some technical problems we had difficulty in solving, and a Special Committee on Unsettled Questions was appointed in the last few days of the conference. We had a little difficulty with the Committee which consisted of the United States, the  Soviet Union, France, Britain, China, and a few other countries. At its meetings, the Russian representative couldn&#x27;t agree to anything. He had to refer all questions back to Moscow and we were in the last few days of the Conference. I proposed that the Committee agree on tentative solutions and then if Moscow said that it was not acceptable, we would reconsider the problems. The Russians didn&#x27;t like that and they complained to Mr. Morgenthau about me. He asked Mr. Vinson to look into their complaints and he told me to proceed as I thought best. Mr. Vinson, later Secretary of the Treasury and Chief Justice of the United States, was nominally the chairman of the Committee. As he was busy with other duties, I acted as the chairman. Incidentally, the Russians had placed a formal protest against Harry White on the quota question, and it became part of the Conference record. They did not submit a formal protest against me. What I did was not a matter of substance, but of procedure. Actually, the Russians helped after that by getting quick answers to our questions. Last year I went to a dinner in honor of Louis Rasminsky, the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, who had been chairman of the Drafting Committee. In his speech he mentioned that I had been chairman of the Committee on Unsettled Problems. He noted that from the present condition of the international monetary system the Committee had not really solved the unsettled problems. I would say that most of the drama came before the Conference. The drama was in the 1943-44 discussions. I mentioned to you that we had discussions with other countries--the Canadians were the easiest to talk with--the Australians were the most difficult. They and others were afraid that we would have a great depression after World War II. I told you I&#x27;d already written an article in 1940 called, &quot;War and the Pattern of Business Cycles,&quot; in which I came to the conclusion that post-war depressions were due to the interaction of the gold standard and wartime Inflation. The war inflation exhausted the money-creating power of gold standard countries and the return to the gold standard led to overvaluation and undervaluation of currencies and expressed the hope that this wouldn&#x27;t happen after World War II. By 1943, I was already telling the countries with whom we were discussing the White Plan that there would not be a postwar depression this time. The British were also worried about the possibility of a postwar depression, but they felt that the scarce currency provision to which the U.S. Treasury had agreed would give them freedom to deal with a postwar dollar shortage. Keynes had invited me to dinner after one of our discussions and that was just before he was to return to England. Also present at the dinner were Thompson McCausland of the Bank of England and Walter Gardner of the Federal Reserve. White was not at the dinner because he was ill. S.B.:  Where was this dinner? Bernstein: It was at the Washington Statler on K Street. The four of us dined by ourselves, but Lady Keynes appeared intermittently to massage Lord Keynes&#x27;s chest at about where the heart would be. The conversation at dinner turned to the capital control provisions of the future International Monetary Fund. [END TAPE II, SIDE II] [BEGIN TAPE III, SIDE I] Keynes said to us that the United States would be glad, at some time in the future, that the proposed Fund permitted restrictions on capital movements. I said to him, &quot;Is that because you expect us to have a great depression after the war? And, in order to strengthen U.S. employment, we would depreciate the dollar, and that might cause a capital flow?&quot; He said that&#x27;s what he meant. I told him that I didn&#x27;t think we would have one, and I explained my view that it was the interaction of wartime inflation and the return to the gold standard, at historical parities, and the consequent deflation that caused great postwar depressions. I said that I didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d make that mistake this time. Keynes wrote a memorandum about this dinner, and Eric Roll, who was then at the Treasury, told me about it. That discussion was very important because at various times we were troubled by the representatives of other countries raising the question of what would happen if there would be a great depression.  We did agree that if there were a great depression and a scarcity of dollars, they could discriminate against the United States once the dollar was declared scarce by the International Monetary Fund. Other countries mentioned their fear of a postwar depression, and the Australians wanted us to guarantee that there wouldn&#x27;t be one. I asked them, &quot;What do you want us to do if we give such a guarantee and there is a depression?&quot; I suppose they wanted us to assure them we would follow a very expansive monetary and fiscal policy. In any case, the issue became of little Importance after we agreed to the scarce currency provision. Harrod mentions this provision as having had a big effect on British thinking. Back to Bretton Woods. It was a very smooth conference, because everything of importance had been discussed and settled in the two years of discussion before the Conference. S.B.: There were only the confrontations with the Russians, you mentioned.  And were there a few others? Bernstein: Yes, we had a few other complaints. Some countries, like Czechoslovakia believed that their Fund quotas were too small. Everybody waned a large quota in the Fund, and a small one in the Bank, because in the Bank, they were guarantors of loans; in the Fund they looked at themselves as prospective borrowers, rather than as lenders. I don&#x27;t think we had much trouble there. With the British, we had no problem on quotas, although there was a question about  the   gold  subscription.    All  of  the  developing countries were given larger quotas in the Fund than in the Bank. The U.S. subscription in the Bank, however, was larger than our quota in the Fund. There was a minor problem with Greece on the provision for a uniform change in par values, that is, a change in the price of gold in all currencies simultaneously. Countries were given two days to declare whether or not they wanted their parity to change under these conditions or to remain unchanged. Varvaressos, who headed the Greek delegation, thought two days wasn&#x27;t enough, and wanted to know why we chose two days. I answered that we thought two days would be a reasonable period during which the exchange markets could be kept closed. To minimize speculation as to whether or not a country would join in a uniform change in par values we wanted all countries to make the decision at about the same time. Varvaressos agreed that this was reasonable. Incidentally, Papandreou, the present prime minister of Greece, was a member of the Greek delegation. An astonishing number of future prime ministers, finance ministers and central bank governors were among the technical advisers at Bretton Woods. They were technicians moving up in the hierarchy. There were a lot of questions like that and my job was to answer them. Everybody seemed to be satisfied with the answers. And it made an enormous impression. This helped me in my own future career. There were other problems in the U.S. delegation that were personal. Mr. Morgenthau had always had an ambivalent attitude toward Harry White, and he was jealous at Bretton Woods because more attention was paid to White than to him. The broadcasting companies had already made arrangements for a broadcast at the end of the Bretton Woods Conference, with White explaining what we had accomplished. Morgenthau did not let White make that broadcast, and so I had to take his place. But Morgenthau didn&#x27;t want my name mentioned either. So we had a panel in which an unidentified American answered the questions put to him by the others. It was a very successful broadcast. I had tea with Mr. Morgenthau at Bretton Woods and he told me how pleased he was with what I had done. Harry White telephoned my wife, who was able to come to Bretton Woods to tell her how well I had done. So everything was great for me until we got back to Washington. And there, as the stories got around about how brilliant I had been at Bretton Woods, Harry White felt his great contribution was being overlooked. By then Keynes was singing my praises as the hero of Bretton Woods, the economist who made everything clear. After the Conference Keynes went to New York, where the Federal Reserve Bank of New York brought together the leading New York bankers. Keynes was going to persuade them that the Fund was in their interest. I got a report from my friends at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about the meeting. The bankers were uncertain about a number of provisions.   And Keynes  said to  them, &quot;I&#x27;ve been over the economics and Bernstein has been over the economics, and we are both convinced that the operations of the Fund are technically sound.&quot; Then they asked about the repurchase provision and Keynes said, &quot;Bernstein wrote that, and it&#x27;s correct.&quot; When I heard this, I was frightened, because I thought White would hear about it and get the strange notion that I was taking credit for his work. So I wrote Keynes a letter in which I mentioned his speech in New York and said I was just a Levite serving the priests in their holy work, that the ideas were White&#x27;s; all I did was to dress them in economic clothing. Keynes wrote a very pleasant reply In which he said, &quot;My dear Levite: We priests need Levites just as the flowers need bees and so forth.&quot; It is a much quoted letter. By then, after Bretton Woods, Keynes was very friendly toward me. S.B.:  So White was satisfied? Bernstein: I don&#x27;t think he heard about it. I didn&#x27;t tell him I wrote the letter; I was just hoping that he wouldn&#x27;t hear about it. But we then had another crisis when White testified after Bretton Woods before the Senate Committee on Banking. When Taft asked him a very technical question. White said, &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t understand it; it&#x27;s too technical.&quot; Taft really was a very important and well informed Senator and there was no reason at all to say that. So White had to apologize. Then, White was asked whether Britain would  need a  loan if  Bretton Woods  was approved. And White answered, &quot;No, Britain would not need a loan.&quot; You know, I had the same dread feeling that I had at the press conference. So I whispered to White, &quot;You should qualify this.&quot; But he went off without qualifying it at all. When we got back to the Treasury, Luxford and I had a private meeting. Luxford was the chief legal advisor of the United States at Bretton Woods. We agreed that White&#x27;s answer would be a disaster if it were allowed to stand. So, we decided to go and tell Harry White that when I write the Committee report, it would disagree with what he said. Incidentally, all Congressional reports of committees on Bretton Woods and later the British loan agreement were written by me. If you read the House report on Bretton Woods, the Senate report on Bretton Woods, you will be reading what I said. So Luxford and I went in to see Harry White and we explained the situation to him. I said, &quot;We don&#x27;t know whether you are right or wrong, but you are foreclosing the Treasury&#x27;s option on a British loan. He asked me what I wanted to write in the report. I said, &quot;I&#x27;m perfectly willing, Harry , for you to write the statement about a British loan, provided we have a sentence which says the committee heard your testimony and doesn&#x27;t agree with it.&quot;  He saw the point. This is what I wrote in the Senate Committee Report &quot;Mr. White testified the British won&#x27;t need a loan after the war.   The Committee  does not  agree.   Whether or  not the British will need a loan depends on how much longer the war lasts, how much destruction there is, how quickly their economy recovers, and so on.&quot; The Committee Report left the issue of a loan open. Keynes wrote to the British Treasury representative in Washington that the Report struck just the right note. I was present at all of the Senate and House hearings on Bretton Woods. I had the complete confidence of the Republicans as well as the Democrats. One reason was that there were Republican congressmen on the Bretton Woods delegation, and they had confidence in my objectivity. So that when somebody was testifying on a point that didn&#x27;t seem reasonable, someone on the committee would call out to me and ask, &quot;Is this true, Eddie?&quot; And I would say yes or no; generally it was true. The people who were testifying were well informed. I was there during the testimony of Randolph Burgess before the House Committee. He was then president of the American Bankers Association and strongly opposed to the Fund. He gave a long list of criticisms and suggested abandoning the Fund or making major changes in the Fund agreement. I thought he was effective, and it troubled me. When he finished, he said to me, &quot;Well, how did you like my testimony?&quot; I said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it at all. You&#x27;re starting with the assumption that we can change the Bretton Woods Agreement. We can&#x27;t. We have made an international agreement that  we have  to abide by.  There are things that could go into the enabling act of the United States and maybe we can say some things there that would meet reasonable objections.&quot; He said, &quot;I think the bankers would be satisfied with the right changes.&quot; When I came back to the Treasury, I told White and the Secretary about this. And the Secretary said, &quot;Very well. Dan Bell (who was the Undersecretary) and you and Luxford go to New York, arrange a meeting with the bankers, and see what they want.&quot; Luxford and I had already been talking about what we were going to do with the legislation. So the three of us went to New York and we met with the bankers at the Federal Reserve Bank. On their aide there were Burgess, Sproul, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank, John Williams, a professor at Harvard and an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank, and Leon Fraser who had been president of the Bank for International Settlements. We talked at lengthall morning, at lunch, and for a time in the afternoon. Luxford explained what we were prepared to put into the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, our enabling legislation. There were important limitations we were willing to have. They included terminating the President&#x27;s authority to change the gold content of the dollar; requiring Congressional approval of a change in the par value of the dollar and in the U.S. quota; and the establishment of a National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial policy of which the Secretary of  the Treasury  would be  chairman.   In the end only Burgess was ready to compromise and we faced the continued opposition of the bankers. S.B.:  In the House? Bernstein: No, in the Senate Committee. Burgess objected to having twelve executive directors for the Fund, twelve executive directors for the Bank, alternates for each. So that was like a pinochle deck; forty-eight in the aggregate and everything duplicated, you see. In the Senate hearings, Luxford prepared a number of questions for Senator Fulbright, who was on the Banking Committee. One of them was designed to show that the criticism of the number of directors was unjustified. Fulbright asked Burgess how many vice presidents there were at the National City Bank, and then how many assistant vice presidents. The analogy to the directors and alternates was not precisely accurate, but it did get across the point that if the National City Bank needed so many vice presidents, then 12 directors in the Fund and another 12 in the Bank was not too many. One of the compromises that Luxford and I had proposed was to have the same person as the U.S. Governor for the Fund and the Bank to coordinate our policy toward the two institutions. The executive directors, however, would be different. Actually, one for the Fund was to come from the Treasury and the other for the Bank from the State Department. Our compromises were designed to get support for Bretton Woods in the Congress. When we came back from the meeting with the bankers and reported what we had done, including the proposed compromises to be in the legislation. White was very unhappy. He asked, &quot;Why do we need the bankers on our side?&quot; What he did then was meet with the Republican members of the banking committeethe House and the Senate  and he made exactly the same proposals to them that we had made to Mr. Burgess. I could see his point. It&#x27;s one thing to look for compromises with the Congressional committees who are going to pass on the legislation. It&#x27;s another thing to make them with the American Bankers Association. In any case, this caused hard feelings between White and me to add to our other differences. S.B.:  What were these other differences? Bernstein: In the meantime, the Treasury had proposed the Morgenthau plan. White said to me, &quot;You&#x27;re going to be in charge of the economics of what would be a reasonable role for Germany in post-war Europe. We don&#x27;t want Germany to be an industrial power again. We&#x27;re going to convert it to an agricultural economy.&quot; The first question that came to me was to prepare a memorandum on how much steel capacity Germany should have. I felt that if Europe was going to be short of steel for reconstruction that the more we could get out of Germany, to go to the others, the better it would be. But White didn&#x27;t want Germany producing any steel at all, even if it deprived the countries that had been occupied by Germany of  steel they  needed for  reconstruction.   And he said, Look, we&#x27;re not interested in your reasons for having German steel production. We want you to give us the economic reasons for not having German steel capacity.&quot; I told White he would have to get someone else to do it. I was out; someone else came in, Irving S. Friedman. Later they published a book on the Morgenthau plan, and they waved it in front of me, as if to say, &quot;See what we can do without you?&quot; Well, they did do it without me. But this added to the difficulties, because I had strong support in the Treasury for my view. I had the Under Secretary, one Assistant Secretary, and all of the Assistants to the Secretary. The last big trouble I had with White was at the time of the negotiation of the British loan. I have already told you how I had put into the report of the Senate Banking Committee the statement that whether the British would need a postwar loan and how much it would have to be could only be determined after the war. And as I told you, Keynes thought the report was very helpful. And now he came with a large delegation to Washington to negotiate on the size and terms of the British loan. S.B.:  Was this in &#x27;45? Bernstein: Yes, &#x27;45. It is after Bretton Woods, and I&#x27;m not getting along well with White. S.B.:  No, I can understand. Bernstein: I was put on a technical committee to determine how  much they  ought to  get and  what the  terms should be--the economic aspects of the loan. White was chairman of that committee and he called a meeting and Luxford and I went. We expressed our views and White didn&#x27;t like them. Our view was that unless we lent Britain enough money, the loan would fail of its purpose. Luxford and I also proposed that as a condition of the loan, the Canadians had to lend them money, too. Of course, the British had always intended to get a loan from them. Now they could go to the Canadians and say, &quot;Well, we need your money, but we can&#x27;t even get the American money unless you make a loan to us.&quot; I didn&#x27;t want the premature convertibility of sterling that White wanted as a condition for the loan. He was still afraid the British would use the sterling balances to get an advantage over us in trade. He wanted to make sure that any country that wanted to buy from us would be able to get dollars for their sterling balances. And that is why White wanted Britain to make sterling convertible as a condition for a loan. I didn&#x27;t think that could be done, but I didn&#x27;t argure about it at our first meeting. I thought there would be plenty of time for Luxford and me to present our views. Unfortunately, that was the only meeting that White held of the committee to recommend the amount and the terms of the loan. The negotiations were coming to their last stage and Luxford and I could see that White was not going to let the Secretary of the Treasury know our views. So we wrote a memorandum to  the Secretary  in which we said that the loan was too little, that the loans would fail, and we would have to go back to the Congress for more money. Later we showed the memorandum to Richard Gardner--that was long after the event. He refers to it in his book Dollar-Sterling Diplomacy. When the Secretary got our memorandum, he called Luxford and me in and asked why we had not said all this before. &quot;Weren&#x27;t you on the committee that gave us the recommendation on the amount and the conditions of the loan?&quot; We told him that the committee had met only once and we were not given a chance to express our views. S.B.:  You had one meeting. Bernstein: We had one meeting of that committee. Well the Secretary it was Vinson now was mad at White anyway, and he said to me, &quot;You&#x27;re going to be in charge of presenting the loan to the Congress. And you&#x27;re going to be in charge of all foreign financial affairs from now on.&quot; So White was displaced by me, although I had not sought this job. S.B.:  He kept his title. Bernstein: Yes. He was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. S.B.:  At this point you were ... Bernstein: I became Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. Actually, I was in charge of all economic policy, the same responsibilities that the Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs has now. You can see  what this would do to White.  We weren&#x27;t talking at all to each other at that stage. I was given an office much nearer the Secretary than his. The Secretary called me in; he never called White. I think by that time, they were beginning to get worried about White, perhaps that he had been a &quot;fellow traveler&quot; in the 1930&#x27;s. I think that may have entered into it too. In any case, Vinson didn&#x27;t like White, and I was put in charge of the work he had done. When the Secretary had to testify on the British loan before the Senate Banking Committee, I rode down with him and with the General Counsel. The Secretary said to me, &quot;What are they going to ask me?&quot; You know, we always have a lot of material ready on what the Committee may ask the Secretary. And I said, &quot;The first question will be, Harry White said the British aren&#x27;t going to need a loan, and here you are coming to us to approve a loan.&quot; The Secretary then asked me, &quot;What&#x27;s the answer to that?&quot; I said, &quot;The answer is on page 20 of the report of the Senate Committee which rejected what Harry White said.&quot; There was the General Counsel of the Treasury, who was a friend of Harry White&#x27;s, sitting there while I&#x27;m telling this to the Secretary. Of course, this got back to White. In fact, that was the very first question that the Committee asked Judge Vinson. And he had the perfect answer. He replied, &quot;Mr. White did say that, but your Committee understood much better than White what the situation would be, and you said . . . .&quot; And then the Secretary read  the Committee  Report to them.  &quot;Now we know what the situation is, and we can tell you that this is the minimum the British are going to need.&quot; There were many pointed questions. One senator asked, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you afraid that the loan to the British will divide the world into two groups?&quot; Vinson said, &quot;The world is already divided into two groups, I&#x27;m just trying to prevent it from being divided into three groups.&quot; Vinson was a very clever witness. The only man I know who was better was Acheson. And, though Acheson was better at testifying, he didn&#x27;t make the impression on a Congressional Committee that Vinson did. To Congress, he was one of their own who played poker with the President! Acheson was a little too aristocratic for some congressmen. After the British loan we had the French loan. The French sent a distinguished delegation to negotiate the loan. The head was Leon Blum, the former prime minister who had just been rescued from a concentration camp. With him were Jean Monnet, already noted as the apostle of European integration, and Emmanuel Monnick, Governor of the Bank of France. I headed an interdepartmental technical committee to decide on France&#x27;s foreign exchange needs. Triffin represented the Federal Reserve on this committee, and it was there that I came to know him and later appoint him as chief of a division in the International Monetary Fund when I became the director of research. The French wanted a large loan, comparable to that made to Britain. As a practical matter  this  was  impossible  as  it  would  have necessitated a congressional appropriation. Instead, we planned to use the Export-Import Bank as the lender. The Bank had just freed a billion dollars that had been earmarked for a loan to Russia. The Russians wanted a loan of *10 billion for reconstruction and would not accept the Export-Import Bank loan. With the removal of the earmark for Russia, the Bank had a billion dollars available out of which a loan of 600-700 million could be made to France. Bill Martin, who was then the head of the Export-Import Bank, did not want to make the loan. He said that would make the Export-Import Bank a one-country creditor. With their prewar borrowing from the Export-Import Bank, and the large new loan, France would have had sixty percent of all the loans outstanding. I thought Mr. Martin had a point. If he was going to run the Export-Import Bank like a bank, he wouldn&#x27;t want all the loans made to one country.S.B.: So would you have preferred to lend to somebody else?  What did you tell him, lend to somebody else? Bernstein: Oh, no. He couldn&#x27;t lend that money to someone else because we needed what he had for France. We didn&#x27;t want to go to the Congress, you see. And we had set aside a billion dollars at the Export-Import Bank to lend to the Russians, but the Russians said they wouldn&#x27;t take a billion dollarsit was too little. Either five billion or nothing. So it was nothing. They wanted more than the British. Maybe they would have settled for what the British got.   We never could get a lend-lease settlement, you know, with the Russians either. Well, I understood the argument that you don&#x27;t want to be a one-country bank; we have some pictures of it today, where some of our banks have four or five percent of their assets in the form of claims on single countries, maybe more. Not five percent of their capital and surplus, but of their assets. And this is very troublesome. So I could understand it as a banker, but, as I said to Mr. Martin, &quot;Bill, we aren&#x27;t running the Export-Import Bank as a money-making bank for it&#x27;s own sake with banking standards, we&#x27;re trying to run it as an instrument of the economic policy of the United States. Of course, we want to help our exports too. But it&#x27;s also broader than that.&quot; In any case, he couldn&#x27;t stop it. The Treasury could get what it wanted. It was at these conferences that Monnet said to me one day while walking with my wife and me, &quot;Who&#x27;s going to run the International Monetary Fund?&quot; I said, &quot;Mr. Gutt is going to be the first managing director.&quot; He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t mean that, Eddie. I mean who, at the Treasury, is going to run the International Monetary Fund?&quot; He said, &quot;Are you?&quot; I said, &quot;If I stay at the Treasury I may run itI mean I&#x27;d be running our side of itbut more likely I&#x27;ll join the Fund.&quot; Remember, at Savannah, White and I weren&#x27;t talking. I was in the midst of the British loan, and I was keeping in touch with the Treasury in Washington every day (we had a direct line) as that was my job.  White was busy doing other things. He was busy setting out what we wanted on management of the Fund. You know the British were very unhappy with Savannah. But, I wasn&#x27;t really part of that delegation; I was there au the principal spokesman for the Secretary. White was being elbowed out more and more as the Treasury spokesman, even though he was doing the talking down there. And at the end of the meeting I heard all about how badly Keynes felt. At the final dinner I had the orchestra play &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot; when Keynes went out. And then I spoke to him and he told me he wasn&#x27;t happy with what had been done; but he was looking forward to my being the director of research, because he had confidence in my economics, and also in my objectivity, and he was worried about objectivity. This was probably in March or April 1946, and a month later, in May or June the Fund was appointing its staff. White had long said that I would have to be the director of research because there wasn&#x27;t anybody else as familiar with the technical economics of the Fund. But when the question came up in the Fund Board and he was asked for his recommendations, he said, &quot;Well, the Treasury has two people it would recommend. One is Frank Coe, and the other is Bernstein. They&#x27;re equally competent technically and Coe is a better administrator.&quot; [END TAPE III, SIDE I] Bernstein: I got the story right away because everybody who  had been  at Bretton Woods was fond of me and they wanted me. So I got the story right away, and the first thing I did was to say to Luxford, &quot;I&#x27;m going to tell the Secretary of the Treasury.&quot; He said, &quot;No. Let&#x27;s go see Harry White first.&quot; So we went to see Harry White and he called in Coe. I said to Harry White, &quot;You didn&#x27;t keep your word. You said you would recommend me to be the director of research.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I did recommend you.&quot; I said, &quot;When you recommend me and Coe and you say we&#x27;re equally competent technically and Coe is a better administrator, I don&#x27;t regard that as recommending me.&quot; At this stage, Coe intervened and said, &quot;Now, Eddie, I want you to know, I do not claim to be equally competent with you, technically. I&#x27;m not.&quot; That took a lot of wind out of White&#x27;s sails. So, White said to me, &quot;Well, what&#x27;s the use of fussing? You&#x27;re going to get it anyway.&quot; But that didn&#x27;t satisfy me. I spoke to the Secretary, and I spoke to Acheson. Acheson said to me, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a glorious career ahead of you at the Treasury. If you go to the International Monetary Fund where White is going to be the U.S. Executive Director, you&#x27;d have to contend with him again. What do you want that for?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, there are two reasons why I want the job. First, the salary is going to be much higher. And second, there is a lot of new technical economics that will have to be developed at the Fund, and I want to do it.&quot; When I went to see the Secretary, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s all right, there won&#x27;t be any trouble about  that,&quot; and  he said,  &quot;There&#x27;s going  to be a cocktail party given by the Executive Directors. You and Edith come with Mrs. Vinson and me.&quot; We arrived in his limousine, and we went through the receiving line together with Vinson and Mrs. Vinson. And he said to everyone, &quot;You all know Eddie Bernstein. He&#x27;s my principal assistant.&quot; So I got the job of being the director of research. About a month later, the Executive Directors called me in and said, &quot;You&#x27;re going to be in charge of everything. We&#x27;d like to know what you think our big problems are going to be.&quot; I said to them at this first meeting of the Executive Directors of the International Monetary Fund, &quot;Actually, our problem is going to be inflation. We had piled up all this liquidity during the war and it will ultimately be activated. The assets acquired during the war are concentrated in cash and bonds. When people spend the cash, prices will go up, wages will have to go up too, so we&#x27;ll have ten years of inflation of prices and wages. As for the exchange rates, they aren&#x27;t going to be decisive until two or three years from now. When the United States has its first recession, it&#x27;ll become apparent that the initial exchange rates can&#x27;t survive any longer. But we don&#x27;t have to worry--until that time--about changes in exchange rates.&quot; So that was my first meeting with them. These views were the basis for the first Annual Report of the Fund and they were later published in two papersone in Staff Papers of the IMF and the other, under Gutt&#x27;s name, in the Review of Economics and Statistics. I had a lot of work on my hands then. The operations of the Fund could not begin until it agreed on initial par values. To get the initial par values, we had to have a report for every country. So I will tell you later of how I developed the economics for the initial par values. But we can leave that until the next time because we&#x27;re at 2:30. [END OF TAPE III, SIDE II] BEGIN TAPE IV [Refers to time at N.C. State College] Bernstein: They invited me to everything, to speak at the civic clubs, and they made me a member of the State History Club, where we had leading politicians as well as two professors. So I enjoyed Raleigh, and I got to know the News and Observer well. Jonathan Daniels asked me to write an article on &quot;Gold: An Explanation.&quot; This was when we went off the Gold Standard, and it was reprinted all over the South, and perhaps elsewhere. I&#x27;ll give you a copy later. It was rather reassuring on the whole business of gold. And later I wrote some other little notes for the News and Observer. including one on &quot;Inflation: An Explanation.&quot; This was about the Inflation Amendment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. You remember the Act was passed in 1933, one of the earliest New Deal measures. It gave the President the power to change the price of gold, to change the price of silver, and to issue 3 billion of greenbacks. That is why it was called the Inflation Amendment,  although   really  it   was  a  section  of  the Agricultural  Adjustment   Act.    (The  first  Agricultural Adjustment Act.) Later, the Glaas-Steagall Act came up. This was either the Banking Act of 1933 or 1934. Senator Glass wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the Act as given to his committee and complained about the use of the words &quot;and/or.&quot; Jonathan Daniels wanted to write about it. I suggested to him, why don&#x27;t you write an article and call it &quot;Glass and/or Banking.&quot; That was the editorial that came out! It was possible too, because I was doing this for the News &amp; Observer, to keep it from running off into extremes, now and then. For example, we had a Professor at Chapel Hill named Erickson, teaching English. In 1936 he went to a Black hotel in Durham, where the Communist candidate for Vice President named Davis, a Black, was giving a speech. And people in North Carolina didn&#x27;t like it at all, including the Raleigh News &amp; Observer. So when Edith and I went to visit him [Jonathan Daniels], we said to him, no look, if you want to show that you are a liberal, this is the way to show it. You are a liberal, not just when you support more help for the farmera--that&#x27;s important, too,--but when you say you don&#x27;t mind a Professor from Chapel Hill going to a banquet in a Black hotel, for a Negro candidate for Vice President on the Communist ticket. He did write an editorial, pooh-poohing the whole thing. I didn&#x27;t give you enough about the time I was working on Foreign Funds Control and the Acting Director of the Stabilization Funds.  So I&#x27;ll tell you a couple of stories. The Foreign Funds Control, not only worked on blocking the assets in this country that could be seized by Germany, but also applied under the Trading with the Enemy Act to all transactions involving various countries, including Japan. I had a very good time with Foreign Funds Control, but there wasn&#x27;t much to do with the Stabilization Fund. It didn&#x27;t really occupy much of my time. But a couple of stories are helpful on this. Around 1943, a man came to see me and said he was the Treasurer of Aramco and that the State Department had told him that I was the man to see. I said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see you. Now what do you want to see me about?&quot; He said they were having difficulty in paying the workers in the oil fields in Saudi Arabia. The only currency in the country is silver rials. I asked him, why didn&#x27;t they buy the rials from the King or his Treasury and they explained that the only thing they could get was silver rials and there wasn&#x27;t any paper money because Ibn Saud was a close believer in the literal statements of the Koran, and they seemed to imply that you can&#x27;t have paper money. Well I looked in a handbook I kept in my desk. All the World&#x27;s Money, and found that there was a very good reason why there weren&#x27;t any silver rials. It had the lowest melting point of any coin in the whole world, for a silver coin.  It was, in fact, the size of the old traditional rupee. And it was just loaded with silver, before the rupee was itself steadily devalued. It probably had a melting point of around 80 cents. Now in the United States, at that time, silver was selling for around 64 cents an ounce, the war having brought it up from 35 cents to 64 cents, but that Was an arbitrary price that was set by the Treasury. In India, Iran and other Middle East countries silver was over $1.00 an ounce. So that rials were worth more as silver than as money. I told him I would like to think about this and I would let him know our view in about a day or two. In the meantime, I got in touch with the State Department and the Secretary of the Treasury, because anything done in the Stabilization Fund is actually done in the name of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Stabilization Fund is the Secretary&#x27;s fund. It isn&#x27;t part of the General Fund of the Treasury. The Secretary asked me whether there was anything the Treasury could do, and I said yes I see what we can do, if you are willing to do it. I said we would Lend-Lease silver from the General Fund to Saudi Arabia. We would then borrow the dies from the Royal Mint of London--because that&#x27;s where they used to coin the rialswe would coin them in Philadelphia and then send them by Lend-Lease Air and give them to the King. The King would then sell them to Aramco. I planned to reduce the silver content of the coin, so that the monetary price would be exactly the same as our silver coins,  that is  $1.29 an  ounce.   This  gave  Saudi Arabia a 50X seignorage even at the market price we had set then for silver. The King undertook to sell the rials at the official exchange rate and take half of the money and put it in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be invested in Treasury bills. This would be the money he&#x27;d have available to buy silver in the market after the war, to reimburse us. Well, the State Department was delighted with this, our first agreement with Saudi Arabia, and the Treasury was satisfied with this arrangement. We had already Lend-Leased silver to the United Kingdom, to India, and to Australia. All of this silver, by the way, did come back. It was Lend-Leased to them to produce silver coins, the argument being, that the time to debase a coin is not, in India especially, in the middle of a war that the United Kingdom is fighting! As you may know, we had two billion ounces of free silver in the General Fund. That was the consequence of buying up silver at 25 cents and 35 cents per ounce. I sent John Gunter, one of my former students at Chapel Hill, to Saudi Arabia, and he made the agreement. The King objected to only one provision of what we had proposed, and that was the investment of the money in Treasury bills, because it paid interest, and that&#x27;s against the Koran. I told John Gunter, to hint in a humorous way, that it couldn&#x27;t be much of a sin, because the interest he was going to get was roughly 3/8 of 1 percent! I had a big problem on Swiss francs all through this period. The problem came about this way. Switzerland was on the list of countries that were blocked. Therefore, they could buy gold with the dollars they earned, and they earned a good deal of dollars then. Because they were getting dollars from everybody, except the</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Longtime civil rights advocate Reverend William W. Finlator speaks powerfully about decades of activism and the future of rights in America. Finlator&#x27;s activism was wide-ranging: he marched for integration in the 1950s and 1960s, joined vigils protesting capital punishment in North Carolina, and advocated for the rights of migrant workers. During a life of activism, he developed strong opinions about capital punishment, racism, the neglect of the poor, and what he saw as the pernicious influence of religion over politics. His most passionate language, however, is devoted to the defense of working people.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  JAY JENKINS: This is Jay Jenkins interviewing the Reverend W. W. Finlator at his home on Arlington Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, April 19, 1985. Mr. Finlator, let me ask you to give us a brief biographical sketch.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Certainly, Jay. But let me first of all express appreciation for the honor of this visit and this interview, and to know that there&#x27;s some interest in my little career over at Carolina and in the preservation of it. I&#x27;m grateful to you. I was born in the little town of Louisburg in Franklin County. My father was a railroad conductor for the Seaboard Railroad, and he was conducting a little branch line that made three round-trips a day between Louisburg and Franklinton. And his train went forward one way and backward the other way; there was no way of turning it around in Louisburg. It&#x27;s interesting that my father, when he was doing that, was also reading law under a judge in Louisburg, and though he never finished highschool he was hungry for knowledge. He had read enough law while he was railroading to go to Wake Forest law school for some summer courses, and to take the bar exam in Raleigh and pass. And he practiced law as well as railroading, which indicates that my background then was a father who was interested in learning and in growing and in improving his mind. We moved to Raleigh after about three or four years, so that I entered the public schools in this city. I went to Murphy school, and then the old Raleigh Junior High School, and then Hugh Morson. After graduation from Hugh Morson High School I went to Wake Forest College for four years. And then upon graduation I went to Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville. I came back to North Carolina and have been pastor of different churches in eastern North Carolina through all my career; I never moved away. Had the first church in Pittsboro, over in Chatham County, and along with that a little church in Randolph County in Liberty. Two part-time churches.  JAY JENKINS: That&#x27;s where you met Mrs. Finlator, I believe.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: That&#x27;s where I met Mary Lib, because she was teaching English and French in the public schools in Pittsboro. She lived in the home of the county superintendent, a wonderful man named W. R. Thompson. He is the father of Reid Thompson, who became a well known public figure in North Carolina and now lives in Washington. And then we went to Weldon for the second pastorate, for five years, then to Elizabeth City First Baptist Church for ten years. And then, in 1956, we came to Raleigh to Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, succeeding the great Dr. Edwin McNeill Poteat at Pullen Memorial. And I was there some 26 or 27 years until I retired a couple of years ago. So that is largely my ministerial career, always in the Southern Baptist Convention. With this addition: Pullen Memorial joined (while I was pastor) the American Baptist Convention, which is a rare thing for a Southern Baptist Convention church to do. We were dually aligned, and the reason the church did that was symbolic as much as anything else. The Mason-Dixon line divided the Baptist Church prior to the Civil War. And once there was one major Baptist Convention and slavery was a division. And so we said we need to transcend that Mason-Dixon line and so we joined both Baptist Conventions, which was an exciting thing to do. Incidentally, it&#x27;s quite fascinating to return to your home, where you were brought up, where you went to public school, became pastor, and see all your old colleagues around there and grow old with them.  JAY JENKINS: You, of course, have been active in civil rights activities for nearly 40 years. Did any individuals have any particular influence on you in this respect?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Yes, very definately. I mentioned my father a while ago. He was a rare character. He had a very deep sense of justice and fairness; we learned this as children. And nothing is learned so quickly by a child as inequity or unfairness. He taught us the value of every person. He never let us say a slurring word about a black person. He had a tender feeling for poor people—people we call today &quot;marginal&quot; and &quot;disenfranchised.&quot; There were words we did not use in those days, but we learned this from my father. And later on I learned from him the value and meaning of a labor union, because he was a member of a labor union with the railroad called the Order of Railroad Conductors. So that all through my life my father—more than I was aware at the time—was a role model for the sense of fair play and justice and tenderness for the rights of people. But when I came to Raleigh, Jay, I had gone only to Baptist schools and I had a traditional upbringing in my home: it was a Southern, puritanical background. My church was Southern Baptist, Wake Forest is a Baptist institution, the Louisville Seminary another Baptist institution, so my education in some ways was restricted. Though neither of these schools I went to put a bar on my curiosity and my inquisitiveness. When I came to Raleigh there was a man here in the United Church, named Carl Voss. He was fresh out of Union Seminary. You remember Union Seminary in the days of Harry Ward, Reinhold Niebuhr and Henry Sloan Coffin, the great intellectual and rebellious Christian leaders. And my association with him was a fascinating thing. He opened up to me worlds of reality that I had just not known about, what with my conventional education. And he told me the things I was supposed to read. He told me I should read The Progressive Magazine, and The Nation, and The New Republic, The Christian Century, and later on I discovered Christianity and Crisis. And these magazines coming to me in the late 1930s and early 40s had a transforming influence on my life. They opened up to me vast worlds of injustice and economic repression, of unfairness, and I began to deal with these issues and relate them to the Bible. And I went through a great revolutionary experience; it was exciting. It was exhilarating. And thereafter I could never be the same. And so this man, Carl Voss, his friendship, his courage, his intellectual integrity, his dashing verve, was a thrill—all that was a thrill to me. But then after my father, and after Voss and after the writers I became acquainted with in The Nation and The New Republic and so on, &quot;way leads on to way,&quot; as Robert Frost would say. These things that made for other things. But at that time, the great Dr. Frank Porter Graham was at his height of influence and leadership in North Carolina. The man I mentioned in Pittsboro, Dr. W.R. Thompson, superintendent of schools, was a personal friend of Dr. Graham and he and I used to talk about Dr. Graham. You can imagine me: I was 23, 24 and 25, unmarried, first church and living in company with a man who was introducing me, personally, to Dr. Frank Porter Graham. And I saw what Dr. Graham was doing then and many years afterwards. I saw that, first of all, he was a loyal alumnus to the great University of North Carolina. I saw that he loved the South—the southern traditions. I saw that he was deeply devoted to his Presbyterian church. I saw that he loved all kinds of people: people who were in the establishment, people who were rejecting him, criticizing him, excoriating him. I saw that he loved people who were black, people who worked in textile mills, people who were on the farm sharecropping, people who were migrants, welfare people and that he identified with all these people and tried to bring them into the mainstream of American opportunity. And I saw that he was a man of sensitivity, of inflexible courage. I saw the way he stood behind his pastor in the Presbyterian Church, Reverend Charles Jones, in the days when the Presbyterians were in the process of removing him from his church, largely because of some of the social stands this young minister was taking. I learned that every time somebody left his church Frank Graham would find out how much contribution he offered to the church and try to make it up himself personally, if he couldn&#x27;t persuade other people to do it. I saw how he dealt with organizations that were supposed to have been charged with being communist infiltrated. I remember one time there were 8 people on a committee and 2 were declared to be communists. And therefore everyone said, &quot;You must get off of that committee.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, if 6 good, American capitalist people couldn&#x27;t handle 2 communists, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. These communists were Americans, and we&#x27;re going to work with them and we&#x27;ll not let both of them take charge.&quot; And I saw the way he loved Thomas Jefferson. He had a great sense of American history and he was devoted to the Constitution. He had almost a sense of veneration for the Bill of Rights. And all of these things together—culture, religion, tradition, background, love of people, intellectual acumen, identification with the disadvantaged people—all these things swam into my ken, and I said, &quot;That&#x27;s my man. That&#x27;s my hero. That&#x27;s my Frank Graham.&quot;  JAY JENKINS: When you came to Pullen in 1956, were you already active in civil rights matters, at that time?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, not as pronounced Jay, as I was at Pullen. But I had run afoul some of the members of our churches in former years because of my concerns about poor people, about the migrants over in the eastern part of the state, about black people in general. And I had run into some difficulty with identifying with the laboring people in Elizabeth City during a strike. And incidentally the man who was the manager of the industry—where some of the people were striking and trying to form a union—was a member of the church. And that was a very delicate situation. But all of this was inchoate, it was in the making even in the very first church, but it was accelerated a great deal after coming to Pullen Memorial where the pulpit was traditionally a free pulpit—something I did not make but that I inherited.  JAY JENKINS: In the 1950s we had desegregation in North Carolina, special legislative session and so forth and so on. What are your recollections of your activities roughly in that era?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, along about that time I was a member, of the North Carolina Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. And we were forced to take action and we regarded that as our proper concern. And so through that committee (of which I later became chairman), I became active. There were times when we supported the protests, the vigils. And incidentally I was pleased with the marches down Fayetteville Street, for example, here in Raleigh, in which we were trying to get the old S&amp;W Cafeteria—which was down on one end of Fayetteville Street, very close to Shaw University—to open up to blacks, particularly Shaw students. And then we were trying to get one of the major theatres downtown to integrate, and two or three stores. And I actually was not a loner. A number of people at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, such as Dr. H. M. Freeman, and others, Larry Highfill, etc. were down there walking and demonstrating. So I actually joined members of my congregation, which was to me a thrilling thing: to be led by your own people. There were organizational meetings held at Shaw University. And by that time the blacks of North Carolina had accepted me into their fellowship. From the very beginning of my ministry I made friends with black ministers, and black superintendents of schools. They would have me in their churches and their schools. Embarrassing, because in those days, your own church would not allow them to come and preach but that did not deter them from their kindness. I began to know black dentists and black physicians and the NAACP began to allow me to be a part of its activities. So when the civil rights movements came, I had a long background of black contact and black friends. And then when I was in Elizabeth City, 99% of the migrants who came through in the spring to harvest the cabbage and the potatoes were black. And I got contact with them through black ministers and other leaders, so that I was greatly enriched with friends—close friends—in the black community long before the 1954 decision.  JAY JENKINS: I don&#x27;t want to jump around. But I know the plight of the migrant laborers has been one of your concerns for many, many years. Has the situation improved to any appreciable extent?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: I would like to think that it has. But then there are moments when I say, you know they&#x27;re still just about where they were. Some improvements, yes. But it&#x27;s so spotty, Jay, and the government now—particularly the Federal Government—seems to be backing away from it, leaving them alone again, giving up on them. It&#x27;s a matter, largely—and I learned this later on—if you&#x27;re a civil libertarian you have to watch yourself because you tend to see everything from the point of view of the denial of civil liberties. And you tend to say that if civil liberties were really enforced, then all our economic problems would fold their tents like the Arabs and would silently steal away. Yet when you look at the migrants, you&#x27;ll see that almost every guarantee of the Constitution—of our freedoms—is denied them. They are unprotected by the Constitution. They don&#x27;t have free speech, they don&#x27;t have free movement, they don&#x27;t have free assembly. They don&#x27;t have equal protection of the law, they don&#x27;t have due process of the law and they don&#x27;t go to court because they can&#x27;t afford a lawyer. They&#x27;re scared of the law and some of them live in virtual peonage, still. They don&#x27;t have equal education opportunities, equal protection of health, social security: these things that you and I just take for granted. And I have discovered, that if you&#x27;re ignorant and poor you don&#x27;t have any civil rights. And when these civil rights don&#x27;t come to you, you are doomed to this kind of sad life, and your children after you. And I&#x27;ve discovered unless somebody stands up as an advocate and says, &quot;These people have got to be brought under the protection of the Constitution and the government is criminal in denying them their rights—or not defending their rights … &quot;That&#x27;s what the Justice Department is for: it&#x27;s to see that justice is insured. That&#x27;s what the Constitution says, we have this country to insure justice. But justice is just not insured these people. They enjoy no equal protection under the law.  JAY JENKINS: I know you and your groups supporting the migrants have advocated state legislation. Have you succeeded in sanitation and fields like that to any degree at all?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: We have succeeded, but oh so slowly, inch by inch. The main reason of course being that the people who employ the migrants are the people who come to represent their communities in the general assembly and they stand between those migrants and justice.  JAY JENKINS: Now, in the 1970s we had Viet Nam. What did Viet Nam do to the civil rights movement? Did it have any effect?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Oh, yes. From the point of civil liberties, we thought that the government was breaking the law, breaking its own law, violating itself in that it was denying a country the right to have a revolution. This country had both a revolution and a Civil War, but we didn&#x27;t want any other country to have either if it doesn&#x27;t fit in with our economic plans. We thought that it was an immoral war and therefore, an unlawful war. War was never declared, and yet it was the longest war the country has ever engaged in. And a great, great loss of life. We thought it was in violation of the Geneva Treaties. We thought that our country was an international outlaw and that our country—that says it believes in rule of law—was itself the great law breaker.  JAY JENKINS: Do you see any parallel between that and Central America and South Africa?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: We see exact parallels, and we&#x27;re Just afraid that the country is determined not to learn anything from history. And we see another great division for this country if this movement to push and accelerate the war down there takes place. And we are prepared—again—to hold our country responsible for violation of its own self.  JAY JENKINS: Do these foreign developments and so forth affect civil rights by diverting attention from internal problems?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, you know, it was part of the great character of Martin Luther King, Jr., that he saw this in the Viet Nam War and was willing to express it. The people who were in the civil rights movement following him said, in effect, &quot;Look, Martin. We got enough ourself fighting for our rights in this country and we&#x27;re making enough enemies. And now, here you are accusing your country at war of doing something wrong. You&#x27;re putting all of this on the line.&quot; But he said, &quot;No. A nation that will do what it did to the blacks in Alabama, will do the same thing to the peasants in Viet Nam. And it&#x27;s a part of the same picture of repression. And if you will repress and supress ignorant blacks and whites in this country—and get away with denying them their rights—then you&#x27;ll do the same thing in other countries. You will install governments and support governments in foreign countries that will supress their people, like the blacks have been supressed in this country.&quot; And we see the same thing now of course in El Salvador and Nicaragua. This country is just not willing to let people throw off repressive governments— —for their own good—when those repressive governments are the ones that we support to hold those people down, to back up our economic system. So Martin Luther King saw this and he was willing to say it and civil libertarians are aware of this too.  JAY JENKINS: The Equal Rights Amendment was another of your concerns. Did you see that in the context of civil rights?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Yes indeed I did. And this was something that used to worry me (and still does) about my Baptist people. They go to the Bible to justify their position on keeping women &quot;in their place.&quot; And they remind us that St. Paul says it is wrong for a woman to speak in the church, and that man should be in control of the household and woman should be subject to man. Like women to men, the church should be subjected to Christ. All this is in the Bible. And they justify their opposition to ERA biblically because all of us have a tendency to read the Bible selectively and we find in the Bible something that justifies what we already believe. And then we give our beliefs Biblical sanction. And the Bible says many things. St. Paul also says in Christ there&#x27;s neither male or female. In the early church women were deacons, leaders. So that there&#x27;s the other picture. And so in fighting for ERA, you have to fight the church because the church stands in the way—it often stands in the way—of simple human justice. But we saw, and vividly see, that the Constitution must really mean women but it doesn&#x27;t say women. And we know that when Thomas Jefferson went home from the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia to tell his family about the Bill of Rights and the new Constitution, it didn&#x27;t mean poor people, black people or even Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s wife. So that through the years we have tried to indicate that the spirit of the Constitution has got to include those poor people, all women, and all ethnic groups. And the only way we can do that … after the Civil War we adopted amendments which talked about race, previous condition of servitude, that meant black—though we had never put women in there, is to put women in the Constitution; hence, ERA. And in the civil liberties movement we found out, Jay, it&#x27;s incredible … We found out there was law after law, statute after statute passed to keep women from being full citizens in this country. And I thought about those words of the great Samuel Johnson, they kept coming to my mind: he said somewhere that God had given women so many natural endowments superior to men, that men had found it wise legally to restrict her. And so we founded this country legally restricting women. And the simple ERA statement means that you just can&#x27;t do that. But we were not quite prepared to find so many women in opposition to ERA and we made a mistake in not trying to understand why women oppose ERA. And we were not able to persuade them to see that it was an economic issue as much as a social issue and we tried to talk of the feminization of poverty. If ERA was passed … think about all the women at work, particularly the women who are the leaders of the household whose numbers are increasing, who are rearing the children. They are the poor people. The children will be poor until women have equal economic treatment with men. This is simple justice, fairness, kindness. And we are just saddened that women don&#x27;t see it. We understand why economic powers don&#x27;t want it because they&#x27;ll have to pay out more money. You can&#x27;t pay a bank teller woman one salary and a man on the way up another salary when this comes.  JAY JENKINS: The Moral Majority has gone so far in some instances to equate a vote for one party or another as a moral proposition, and furthermore that the vote for a certain party is &quot;God&#x27;s will.&quot; Is that an example that you would cite as using selective use of the Bible?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, now yes. As a minister, I have to plead guilty that all of us do that. We have to realize that the Bible says different things. For example, there are some Christians that say unless you believe, let&#x27;s say, in the virgin birth of Jesus, you cannot be a Christian. And the virgin birth of Jesus is in the Bible. But now other people say, &quot;Well now, yes. But Jesus never mentioned the virgin birth.&quot; They say, &quot;Paul never mentioned it. And St. Peter, when he preached never said, ‘Unless you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus you cannot be saved, can&#x27;t be a Christian.’&quot; And further St. Paul said that Jesus was born after the fashion of man, which is in contravention to the virgin birth. Now, we will say look, both of these are in the Bible. One branch of Christians have no right to say, &quot;This is it. And this is the only interpretation. Unless you accept my interpretation, you&#x27;re not a Christian.&quot; But what&#x27;s happened with the fundamentalists and the Moral Majority people is that you have a very vigorous, aggressive, competitive, combative successful group of Christian leaders who have decided what constitutes Christian faith with their selective use of the Bible and that&#x27;s it. And among other matters they say, &quot;Unless you are against gay rights, unless you are against abortion, unless you are against obscenity, unless you are for prayer in the public schools, unless you are against the teaching of evolution in the public schools—unless you are right on these things, you&#x27;re not a Christian. Because this is Christianity.&quot; Then, you see, you have the Christian faith divided between those who are in it and those who are excluded. Now the people who have the truth, Jay, are organizing politically. They are targeting people in Congress who do not share their beliefs in these matters. They are targeting people on school boards who do not share their beliefs. And they&#x27;re saying everybody on the school board, everybody in Congress has got to be one of us. Now this, of course, is the ultimate violation of church-state separation. This is a religious spectacle that the Constitution rejects. These people are becoming more and more powerful and their thinking—zealous as they are—is in some ways an ideology with fascist overtones. And these people are in power today and are grabbing more power. And anyone who believes in civil liberties knows these people have little patience with the First Amendment; they&#x27;d like to have it out of their way. And the fight for civil liberties is a beleaguered fight today. And the sad thing about it, for me, Jay, is that so many of these people are Baptists and they don&#x27;t realize that they&#x27;ve forsaken their Baptist faith.  JAY JENKINS: What part does your Baptist faith play in your stance on civil rights?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, the Baptists of course, are supposed to be great advocates of church-state separation through their history. That&#x27;s one of the tragedies we see taking place today as I just said. The people like Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson who are tremendously successful televangelists are saying this is the definition of the Christian faith. And we have a country now, a President, an administration, who sides with these people, who identifies with them. Which is to say we have now an administration taking sides with a divided Christian community. You can see how ominous that is. It is the ominous fact that the administration is not only identifying with the Christian faith, while so many of our people in America are not Christians at all, but it is taking sides with a particular expression of the Christian faith: Pandora&#x27;s Box is about to be opened. But now, back to the Baptists. Anyone who understands, or who bothers to take the trouble to understand, what Baptists are supposed to believe (and most Baptists today simply won&#x27;t take the trouble: they don&#x27;t want to know anymore than in the days of the civil rights movement when most southerners wanted to know what was in the Bill of Rights) will find that Baptists—traditionally—were forced to be civil libertarians. And by that I mean, Jay, that the way that Baptists began along with other dissenting groups, they found themselves in the old countries with the great religious wars, as neither Catholic nor Protestant. That meant that they were in areas where a nation was either an official Catholic nation or a Protestant nation. And by that I mean that nation had an established church and the church was supported—whether it was Catholic or Lutheran or Presbyterian or Anglican—by the state and there was no church-state separation. And if you belonged to that state, you belonged to that church; if you belonged to that church, you belonged to that state. Patriotism and faith were merged into one thing, and if you were subversive religiously, you were subversive politically. Now, in that situation, the Baptists and the other dissenting groups found themselves as neither fish nor foul; neither Protestant nor Catholic. So both Catholic and Protestants lined up against these dissenting groups, among which were the Baptists. In order to survive, these persecuted groups had to fight for freedom of speech, they had to fight for freedom of the press, they had to fight for freedom of assembly, they had to fight for freedom of conscience, they had to fight for freedom of privacy. All of these basic freedoms that we see in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were fought for by Baptists centuries before [the Constitution] was established. O.K. Now, that means a Baptists fights for his own freedoms, protection of his own conscience, the local autonomy (the rule of his own church), separation of church and state. That means also that he found out that his freedoms were not secure unless he held those freedoms secure for everybody else. Now when we talk about church-state separation—the reading of prayers in public schools—and you find Baptists in support of this sort of thing, you know that they&#x27;ve departed from the faith of their fathers. All of these civil liberties that I&#x27;m talking about—so many of them—are right there in Baptist history. And this Baptist history had a great deal to do with the adoption of the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. So finally, what we&#x27;re dealing with today is a large number of electronic, fundamentalist, successoriented Baptists who don&#x27;t want to know anything about their history or what Baptists are supposed to believe. And therefore, these are the people who are betraying civil rights and freedom. For instance, if you take the matter of conscientious objection, you would think that the very first person to defend a conscientious objector would be a southern Baptist because they have always said we must have the protection of private conscience, the right to read the Bible, to interpret the Bible, to let God speak to us from the Bible to our own conscience—person to person, and what God says to us we must honor. But when a Baptist says, &quot;I cannot support military conscription,&quot; how many Baptists will today come to his support? We see an unfolding drama in the so-called &quot;split&quot; in the Southern Baptist Convention today, and there is a very serious split. It&#x27;s between the people who are known as fundamentalists and the people who are known as moderates. The word conservative perhaps ought not to be used because all Southern Baptists, with rare exceptions, are conservatives. Liberalism, as we know it, is almost nonexistent in the Southern Baptist Convention, although the fundamentalists are today accusing the moderates of being liberals. The difference between the fundamentalists and the moderates is that a number of Baptists (I don&#x27;t know how many) who are fundamentalists, of the Jerry Falwell type, who are sure that Christianity means certain things, that you have to believe in the inerrancy of the scriptures, you have to believe in the physical resurrection of Jesus, you have to believe in the virgin birth, in the blood atonement: &quot;Unless you believe exactly like we believe, you&#x27;re not Baptist.&quot; And this, of course, is in violation of the Baptist persuasion of openness, and plurality, and dissent and freedom. The people who believe this way, Jay, seem in ascendance. Thus the Southern Baptist Convention is at a great crisis in that so many of us really have never understood the faith of the fathers. It is not with us still.  JAY JENKINS: Are these Baptists from the Southwest primarily, are they in effect trying to set up some sort of doctrinal test for Baptists who traditionally have had autonomy in the local churches?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: That&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re doing and it&#x27;s very damaging.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  JAY JENKINS: What about the issue of capital punishment and the civil rights of prisoners?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Yes, I&#x27;d like to discuss that. Years ago, a Virginia federal judge (I forget his name) made a statement that has pretty well been followed through the years and this is, in effect, that when a person becomes a prisoner of the state he loses all rights to citizenship and he is virtually a slave of the state. And in a sense that is actually what has happened. A prisoner is someone you can forget. He&#x27;s denied his citizenship, his rights. He can&#x27;t even vote once he comes out if he&#x27;s committed a felony. And he&#x27;s said goodbye to protections that normally come to people in society. Through the years this has been interpreted as meaning his freedom of movement, of course, is gone, his freedom to write or receive letters or to read what he wants to read, or to receive an education while he&#x27;s there; all these things—with regard to his health, his privacy—are severely restricted. Civil libertarians have said over and over again that an inmate is a citizen and must be treated as such. In fact, we&#x27;ve drawn up a bill of rights for prisoners, emphasizing the fact that incarcerating a person does not give the state the right to remove his basic civil liberties as far as they can be safeguarded to him under the limitations of incarceration. So, his right to health, his right to education, his right to reading, his right to receiving people, contact with people, all of these things should be safeguarded. And the state has no &quot;carte blanche&quot; to deny him these rights. Civil libertarians are not prison reformists. But we simply know that until the state protects the civil liberties of prisoners and therefore their dignity, there&#x27;s no possibility of reform, of modification of behavior in the best sense of the word. And we feel that the ultimate violation is capital punishment and the long years on death row and the isolation that goes along with it. Now, civil libertarians are against capital punishment for a number of reasons. One of the most obvious reasons is that 99% of death row people have had court appointed lawyers; only 1% have been able to employ their own lawyer. Anyone with any sense of the legal system in this country knows that that&#x27;s not equal justice under the law, which means that anybody that can afford first-rate lawyers is not on death row. It means also that death row is reserved for a certain segment of society: the poor, the illiterate, the unlearned and the powerless. It always boils itself down to that. Now any law that has to be administered that way is unconstitutional on its face; there&#x27;s no such thing as equality under the law when only those people are paying with their lives.  JAY JENKINS: You&#x27;re saying that the application of the law is a hurdle you have to cross before you get to the moral aspects of it.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Absolutely. We don&#x27;t come at it from a question of the moral point of view. We in civil liberties are not facing the moral issue. Actually, if you want to go to the Bible, you can justify capital punishment. The Bible is for it, the Old Testament especially. The Bible sets up capital crimes. Adultery is a capital crime. Cursing your parents is a capital crime. Apostasy—leaving your religion and accepting another religion—is punishable by death. Well, there were many crimes that were punishable by death in the Old Testament, and there used to be many in this country and in the old countries; now we&#x27;ve got it down to about one or two. But we just don&#x27;t want to let that one or two go and when push comes to shove, you know and I know what kind of person goes to the death chamber … And then of course, civil libertarians have known through the years that capital punishment is kind of an Anglo-Saxon barbaric relic. It has had its greatest incidence in the southern part of the United States. And it has been used as a means of social control of blacks, rather than a means of administering justice. So that for these and many other reasons, we know that capital punishment is a most unjust denial—a most unconscionable denial—of simple Justice under the law.  JAY JENKINS: I know that during your ministry you frequently went to Central Prison and you conferred with death row inmates and so forth and so on, Just as did your old friend Paul Green of Chapel Hill. Could you tell us some of your reactions to some of those personal experiences?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: I&#x27;m so glad you mentioned Paul Green, because he&#x27;s the one we ought to be talking about. And since I mentioned people like Frank Graham, I must say that Paul Green has been a great influence in my life. And I&#x27;m very honored now to serve on the Paul Green Foundation, a newly organized group out of Chapel Hill. But he&#x27;s the one for whom we celebrate the &quot;lone vigil.&quot; He would come over at night—the night before an execution—and Just stand quietly outside by himself all night long, outside the prison, in silent protest. And when the dawn came and the execution took place he&#x27;d go back home. And he did that alone for years, the lone vigil, until we began to rally around his cause. I&#x27;m sorry today that the mood of the country has gone in the other direction. We came almost to the promised land. We came to the Jordan River, we looked across over it and we went back. Now we&#x27;re in the wilderness again, wandering around and executing people and believing that once you execute someone you can stop other homicides. We know that&#x27;s not true.  JAY JENKINS: What is your opinion of the Reagan Administration in so far as the civil rights program is concerned?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Mr. Reagan and his colleagues are no friends of civil liberties; and in order to do what they are doing, they know that civil liberties must be soft-pedalled and diminished. That&#x27;s why he radically changed the Civil Rights Commission and now it is indeed a sham and a mockery. During the years prior to his coming, the only federal organization that existed that was willing to criticize the government for its violations of civil rights was the Civil Rights Commission. And it would have been much better, much more honest, for Mr. Reagan to have tried to abolish it completely than do what he&#x27;s done to it since it now is actually an organization that puts an approval on his consistent denials of human and civil rights at home and abroad. And the fascinating and frustrating thing about Mr. Reagan is that he gets away with all this, and still gives the impression of a man who believes in civil rights, a man who never goes to church but has the impression of being a very churchminded person. A man who is impoverishing people more and more and transferring wealth from poor people to the people who already have it, and is known as a man of compassion and concern. These things of course frustrate, and really enrage us, but we know that this is a time when American people have grown weary, as St. Paul said, they&#x27;ve grown weary of well doin. They want these structures of protections of people, these social agencies of compassion, they want them enfeebled and dismantled. And in order to do these things you&#x27;ve got to change your attitudes on civil liberties and you&#x27;ve got to appoint Judges who are no longer favorable to civil rights. And so what we&#x27;re seeing is a gradual disestablishment of civil protections and we&#x27;re seeing it done by a president who—because of his posture of patriotism and religion—is able to give the American people a sense of a satisfied conscience, and a sense that what is being done is &quot;chic&quot; and accepted, &quot;American&quot; and Christian, and it is right to believe this. Then, on top of all this, Jay, you have the religious people, the Moral Majority, the Fundamentalists, all across the country giving religious sanction to what is basically a selfish America, and a self-centered America, and a power crazed America. The president persuades the people that it&#x27;s patriotic and religious; the fundamentalists say it&#x27;s &quot;God blessed.&quot; And in all this we are trying to say that this is a Christian nation, that we want Christians in government, we want Christian schools, we want prayer in school. So that whatever this administration does at home or abroad, however many more people are impoverished, whatever we do by way of repression to undeveloped or developing nations, it&#x27;s o. k. because it&#x27;s been done by a Christian nation.  JAY JENKINS: What does this portend for the future tranquility of the country if, as you indicate, we are deepening divisions between classes and so forth.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: If it continues, you don&#x27;t have any church-state separation. Church-state separation means that you have a church so autonomous, so distanced institutionally from its own government that in the name of God and truth, the church can place the nation under the Judgement of God, to say, &quot;Thus sayeth the Lord.&quot; To America, like the prophet Nathan told David, the church can no longer say &quot;Thou art the man.&quot; You are the one doing wrong under God. The church has lost that capacity, that distance, to bring America before the bar of God&#x27;s Judgement, because the church has been so merged with the state that patriotism and religion are synonomous. So that America is deprived of conscience. The United Nations can&#x27;t stop America, the World Court can&#x27;t stop America; only Americans can stop America; and the American church more and more has forfeited that right and that opportunity to save it.  JAY JENKINS: At this point let me ask you, just for the record, to list the official positions you&#x27;ve held with civil rights organizations through the years.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well first off let me start by saying I&#x27;m a Baptist. And as a Baptist I believe in local autonomy and free speech, free assembly and free press and free association and I don&#x27;t want any CIA or FBI to invade my privacy, to read my letters, to find out whom I&#x27;m associating with, what books I&#x27;m reading, and where I&#x27;m going, and not enjoy surreptitious entry to record and censor my sermons. I demand all of this as a Baptist and I cannot preach the gospel of Jesus Christ unless these protections are mine. And I defy any government invading them, but my government is invading them. But I cannot be a true Baptist without believing in all of these protections, nor can I believe in these protections unless I am willing to extend them to the socialists, and the communists, and the lesbians, and the homosexuals and all the rest who have a right to their way of life in our free and open society. So my first civil rights position is as a Baptist preacher. I can&#x27;t persuade my fellow Baptists to see that [laughter]! But I hope they&#x27;ll come around to know what  I&#x27;m talking about. Then I have belonged, from its very beginning, to the North Carolina affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). And for a number of years I was on the board of directors and for maybe ten or twelve years— was chairman of the legislative committee. And if I were chairman of that committee I would be down at the General Assembly right now to oppose what the people are trying to do to the public schools—trying to weaken the schools in the name of family values, which I think is an imposture. Then, as time went on I was elected to the National Board of the A.C.L.U. and while there I was made one of its vice-presidents and worked with its Religious Liberty Committee. (I was a member of that committee.) More recently, I&#x27;ve become the vice-president of a new organization called Southerners for Economic Justice. That&#x27;s a small group of people who try to extend industrial, political, economic justice to all southern people. It&#x27;s a group of very influential people. So that these are the major, official connections I&#x27;ve had with civil liberties organizations. There&#x27;ve been others, but these are the major ones.  JAY JENKINS: You mentioned your position on legislative relations. Let me ask you a pretty general question: just how liberal is the state of North Carolina?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, that is a question that has troubled a lot of us. I think that we have had, in our state, a facade of progressiveness. There is, of course, some substance to it. I remember reading a history book, years ago, in which the author was talking about North Carolina (he was an Englishman). And he was saying that North Carolina was a state between two aristocratic states: Virginia and South Carolina. And when the Civil War came, the aristocracy of those states—the elite quality—was challenged and toppled. North Carolina never had been one of those high peaks and it never suffered that kind of &quot;shame&quot; and embarrassment and therefore, as time went on, it emerged between these two states as a very progressive state. While they were still struggling with their past glory. In a sense, that&#x27;s true. At that time through the years there was no Baptist school comparable for its openness in southern states to Wake Forest College, and there was certainly no university like the University of North Carolina in other southern states. And there was perhaps no one quite like our Governor Aycock who was a great devotee of public education. So that all of this gave an impetus to North Carolina. People like Frank Graham and his predecessors; people like William Louis Poteat of Wake Forest who fought the evolution controversy in North Carolina. And because of that we began to think that we were indeed a progressive state. People like Governor Scott came along and paved our highways, put us in advance in some ways of our other southern sister states. But Jay, this image was kind of exploded in recent elections. When Frank Graham ran to be elected to the Senate after his appointment by Governor Scott had expired and when he was defeated on the racial issue—which pure and simple defeated him—the illusion of progressiveness vanished. Then came the Jesse Helms years. And we&#x27;ve discovered that North Carolina is not so progressive, that if you scratch us enough you will find that we are racists. And this racism is not confined to what people call &quot;redneck&quot; people. The racism is in the country clubs, the chambers of commerce, and we find out that so many of our ideals—openness, fair play, justice and equality—dissipate at a time like this. And it&#x27;s been a very disillusioning experience for many of us, disappointing and sad. But we know it&#x27;s here and we must deal with it. But, on the other hand there are a great number of North Carolinians as the vote will show, who will not bow their knee to this kind of Baal and who stand for justice and rightness and the principles of equity. And they&#x27;re outnumbered, but they&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re here in large numbers. And you can count on them.  JAY JENKINS: Do you think that prejudice is a greater influence sometimes than self-interest? Or exerts more influence over the voters sometimes than their own self-interest?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, yea, although self-interest is not what the capitalists call &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot; The leaders of our state have always known (and it&#x27;s true) that poor whites—when push comes to shove—can always be more vocal and changed by the introduction of the race issue. They have preferred their poverty to any kind of cooperation with black people. And our leaders have always been able to defeat populist movements on this basis, so we don&#x27;t know our own self-interest when it comes to this issue. But this has been exploited time and again in the South and in North Carolina. And it was exploited dramatically in the Frank Porter Graham election, when you could even persuade laboring people, textile workers, industrial unions, to vote against Graham because of the race issue and the so-called &quot;communist&quot; issue, which of course was a red bait! And this is a sad spectacle to behold of this real politics of North Carolina.  JAY JENKINS: Do you think the so-called &quot;industrialization&quot; of the state will exert influences for good or ill on this question in the future? Bringing in new people and management cadres, from other parts of the country?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, I think that perhaps we have not always tried to recruit the best kinds of industries to North Carolina. I&#x27;m not sure how to respond to that. There are so many people who say, &quot;All we need are more Baptist churches to make us a better society.&quot; Well, the Baptist churches have been in the South for all these years and did not change the South in its attitudes towards labor, poor people, towards black people, towards disenfranchised people. It has never preached the gospel of social concerns. And to multiply all those Baptist churches over and over again would not make any difference if they&#x27;re all the same way. And if you bring in industries that are not enlightened, that are repressive and insensitive of the people who work for them, who are inimical to unionism, and so on, I can&#x27;t see that&#x27;s a great blessing to us.  JAY JENKINS: I gather that you&#x27;re not overly optimistic about the future in so far as civil rights are concerned.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: No one, seeing the vote for the present administration and the election of John East and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, can be over optimistic. That doesn&#x27;t mean he or she can abate her or his commitment one bit. But optimism, no.  JAY JENKINS: I&#x27;d like to go back to your official civil rights positions. Didn&#x27;t you also occupy some offices in National Organizations? I remember you went on the Phil Donahue Show representing … was that a national civil rights organization?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: That was the A.C.L.U.  JAY JENKINS: A.C.L.U. We&#x27;ve covered that. I know that when you&#x27;re speaking out on civil rights issues, perhaps early and late, it takes a certain personal toll on a minister and his family when he champions unpopular causes. Talk about that a little bit.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: That of course is true. And any minister that becomes involved in issues like these has got to know that there&#x27;s a price to pay. I have been singularly fortunate through my years in that only for the very last few years in my ministry has my position with the church been at stake. I&#x27;ve always been aware that the people in the congregations have not agreed with me and I&#x27;ve always tried to listen to their grievances. But none of the churches—and this is amazing Jay—in Pittsboro, in Weldon, in Elizabeth City, none of them came to the point where they penalized me in reduction of my salary or asked for my retirement. That never happened. It never happened until I passed retirement age here in Raleigh. But you have to realize that it&#x27;s a dangerous game to play, putting it in that kind of terminology. It&#x27;s difficult on your family. To be fired as a pastor of your church is almost to be without hope, because to be fired by a church for your social activities means that very rarely will any other church call you. You have to go into some other field to survive. But on the other hand, you have an obligation to understand the congregation. For most Baptists the race issue was a difficult thing. I&#x27;ve had people tell me that the first time they saw a black person coming into our church they were gone for good. In the churches that I&#x27;ve served the people who ran the industries were on the deacons board. It&#x27;s unthinkable that they&#x27;d support labor unions. To be opposed to war, when you have members of your church who were serving on the foreign field … and to come out and tell the congregation that this was an illegal war and that we ought not to be in it, we ought to get out of it, our country stands in Judgement … these things are terribly hard on a congregation. And through the years you lose members and they don&#x27;t come back. And it&#x27;s painful because people whom you lose are your friends as well as your church members. And this is a toll that you have to face.  JAY JENKINS: What about reactions from the non-members of your congregation? Don&#x27;t you get some reaction from people who are not members of your church?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Oh, absolutely. Every time you do these things you have all kind of response out in the world. The only thing that keeps you going … You must make this concession: ministers are vain critters and we have a high sense of our self-importance and this conflicts with the situation too. But, if you have the feeling, Jay, that you&#x27;re given to these causes for life, because they&#x27;re Biblically Justified, because your Christian conscience demands it, then there is an exhiliration in it and the risk taken is part of the fun. And you hope that you&#x27;ll survive. And you always know that there are people out there—in the church and outside the church—who understand what you&#x27;re doing and who want to support you. I used to get letters from all over the state, from other churches, in times of great crisis, and they would say to me, &quot;We wish our minister would say what you say. It needs to be said and it needs to be done.&quot; So all these things were supportive. But you know that your finance committee will remind you that the contributions are falling off. And you know that your evangelistic committee will tell you that people are not coming to church, you&#x27;re not getting recruits, they&#x27;re staying away. Other churches are drawing them and you&#x27;re not. And you know that people will come and tell you that so-and-so has left us and joined the Episcopal church, the Presbyterian church, or another Baptist church and these are anguishing times. And you really begin to question yourself. You say, &quot;Well, I really am a damned fool after all. I&#x27;m a zany.&quot;  JAY JENKINS: At the start you gave us a brief biographical sketch, but could you give me some specific dates, when you were born, when you graduated from Wake Forest, etcetera?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Yes. I&#x27;m now 71 years old and I was born in 1913 in Louisburg. And I think I was about 4 when my family moved to Raleigh. I went to Murphy Elementary school and I joined the church and I was baptized at the old Tabernacle Baptist Church on Person Street which was a traditional southern Baptist church. I finished Hugh Morson High School in 1930 and Wake Forest in 1934, when it was still in the community of Wake Forest. And I finished the Baptist Seminary, it is called the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in Louisville in 1937. And I was called about October or November of 1937 to two churches: Pittsboro, in Chatham County and Liberty, in Randolph County. And I must have then just turned 23 or 24 when I had my first pastorate. I was supposed to be a mature pastor of two churches! There are so many mistakes in front of you, so much to learn, and so much enjoyment of life. And I married in 1941 when I was 28 years old. I married Mary Elizabeth Purvis of Salisbury. We have three children. The oldest is Wallace, W.W. Jr. who lives in Raleigh. He went to Wake Forest and the Free University of Berlin and received his master&#x27;s degree at the University of Pennsylvania. He has a Ph.D. degree in German from Yale, but has decided at mid-career that teaching is not what he wants to do, not what is in the book for him. So now he is working in the Court house and going to night law school. Linguistics, when he finished at Yale University, began to go out of the schools, and so he began to see that a University career was rather uncertain. We have a second child named Elizabeth who is married to a Presbyterian minister in Charlotte and they have three children. Wallace has three children. He&#x27;s married to Silke Marquardt from Germany. And then our youngest is Martha who is a lawyer, working in Washington, D.C. and married to another lawyer.  JAY JENKINS: And you came to Pullen in 1956?  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Yes, in 1956. And retired in 1982.  JAY JENKINS: Civil rights advocates in North Carolina are relatively few and far between. Tell us about some of your colleagues in this cause in North Carolina.  WILLIAM W. FINLATOR: Well, it would be difficult to name one without naming a lot of others, Jay. I hesitate to do this, but let me tell you an incident. When I first came to Raleigh I picked up an article, and I don&#x27;t know where I saw it, but it was an article by a young professor of law at the University of North Carolina, named Daniel Pollitt. It was an article about what the labor unions call &quot;14b.&quot; And that&#x27;s known as the right-to-work law. It was an article dealing with the injustice of these laws which were being adopted by legislatures across the country, particularly in the South. A law which really operated to the effect of making it almost impossible to organize labor unions. It was a misnomer: it was called the right-to-work but actually it was in one sense the very opposite of that. And I was already aware of this kind of activity and this law. When I read this article, I said, that law professor has written with such clarity and persuasion and force that I&#x27;d like to know him. And I wrote him a letter to congratulate him and thank him for it. And then one thing led to another and he and I became friends. I found out he was one of the most enlightened supporters of the rights of laboring people. Through him and through the years with him (he teaches Constitutional law and the Bill of Rights) my vision was enlarged and my perceptions deepened about civil liberties. He and I have oftentimes come over to testify to committees in the General Assembly. And then I began to learn how labor is treated in North Carolina. And one day I was down in—I won&#x27;t name the town but it was—an industrial community in North Carolina and the issue of unionization was at stake. They were about to vote. And I saw, Jay, intimidation at its worst. If any of these people working for this industry were seen to be in any kind of association with the labor union organizer, or if they were saying anything in favor of unionization, their jobs were at stake. They were fired. And not only were they fired, but if their wives and children and relatives were in the same industry, their jobs were at stake. And then when this person who&#x27;d been fired went out to get credit, the banks refused to extend the credit. If he went to the grocery store and asked them for a charge, the grocery store would deny him. All of the town would penalize him. And then if he went to an adjoining town, or a nearby town, or a town far away he was on a blacklist and they wouldn&#x27;t hire him because of this. And I saw that he had no right of free speech, free assembly, free press, due process, equality under the law, and I said, &quot;My God. There&#x27;s no hope for these people unless they have something to protect them. And if the labor union is not able to deliver on better wages or working conditions, just the fact that it would give these people a sense of belonging to something, a solidarity, a base of support to make them become self-respecting American citizens.&quot; And I said, &quot;All of their civil liberties have been denied.&quot; How could you not defend those people? This association with poverty was another matter for the University. Frank Graham, Paul Green, Daniel Pollitt. None of them Baptists, but they were all dear friends, very enriching in my life. And so I saw that unions … I remember the story about this guy going to court and hearing his case read out. &quot;The next case is the State of North Carolina against Paul Jones.&quot; And when Paul Jones heard that read out he said, &quot;My God, what a majority!&quot; But when you look at a union in North Carolina, what have you got against it? You&#x27;ve got the churches against it. I&#x27;ve been to AFL-CIO meetings in North Carolina and people told me, &quot;Oh, I wish our pastor would identify with us. He always identifies with his managers.&quot; The chamber of commerce, many of the newspapers, merchants associations. Everything in North Carolina that has power is against the working man when he tries to have a little power of his own with his union. And not to be an advocate of this person is to forfeit, in many ways, your opportunity as a minister to love people.  JAY JENKINS: This concludes the interview with the Reverend W. W. Finlator and on behalf of the Southern Oral History Program, I&#x27;d like to thank him for submitting to it.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is BETTY MASON now serving in the Senate Agriculture Committee
Washington, D. C.
January 8, 1983
&#x27; •? ■
BB: Were you on Senator Jordan&#x27;s staff?
BM: I was on the committee staff when he was a member of the committee.
BB: What was your impression of him as a Senator?
BM: He was top-notch; and I mean that.
BB: Why do you say that?
BM: He always seemed to be on top of things and I think he especially
liked agriculture because it meant so much to his state.
BB: What was your direct association with him?
BM: I was just one of the clerical people for the committee, but he
always came in and spoke to us and actually he was just a very pleasant
man--in fact he was one of the sweetest men I think I have known around
the Senate. For instance, at Christmastime he would come in with a
box of candy behind his back and he would say, &quot;Now you men can&#x27;t have
any of this, it&#x27;s just for these women&quot; and he would give it to us. And
of course we&#x27;d give him a big kiss too. There were just three of us and
we did like him very much--we felt very badly when he died. Then every
once and a while he would bring his wife into see us.
BB: What did you think of her?
BM: She was a lovely, lovely lady. Just very sweet. But I don&#x27;t think
they make men like that anymore to be perfectly honest with you. Of
course we had Bill Cochrane too, that worked for him; he always kept
everybody on their toes--between the two of them.
BB: Was Everett Jordan a hard task master?
BM: No. He accomplished what he wanted, but in a very kind manner. You
wanted to do things for him; whereas if someone had ordered you to do
such you wouldn&#x27;t have done it as easily or as well.

BB: Did he expect a lot from you?
BM: I think he expected a lot of his people, yes.
BB: He was not a clock-watcher; how about his employees, did they
catch that spirit from him too?
BM: I think they did. That&#x27;s why it was just such a pleasure to work
with him.
5: Anything outstanding about him that you remember?
BM: Just that he was sweet and kind. A typical Southern gentleman.
BB: Did his philosophy of life have1 anything that related to your
philosophy?
BM: I wish I could have been able to think along the lines he did
because he had such a nice outlook on life.
BB: How about his knowledge of the subject?
BM: Honey he was extremely knowledgeable. He seemed to have the farm
economy at heart. In other words he was interested in the farmer.
BB: Was he easy to persuade if he had an opinion different from yours?
BM: I don&#x27;t know. I just thought that whatever he did was fine. I
didn&#x27;t begin to know anything near what he knew--but if he said it, it
sounded good to me.
BB: Did he ever tell you any of his homespun stories?
BM: He used to tell some stories occasionally when he had time but he
didn&#x27;t really have too much time.
BB: Do you remember any of them?
BM: No I really don&#x27;t; it&#x27;s been so long ago. I can see him just as
plain as anything though anything we could do for him when he was
ill. Another lady in the office and I would send him one rose. We did
that a couple of times and he really appreciated that. We got a note from
somebody down there. We&#x27;d send him a rose every once and a while to let
him know we were thinking about him. He liked that. Nothing fancy, just

one little thought.
Have you talked to Nancy Bradshaw? She would know a lot because
she was in his office. You see we didn&#x27;t see him except when they had
hearings or meetings. At that time our staff was small. We had four men
even
and three women. And those four men/loved him--I mean when I say loved
him--they thought he was great!
BB: Was this the Agriculture Committee?
BM: Right. I wish some of them were around to tell you how much they
thought of him. We&#x27;ll never forget him, I can tell you that.

<dc:creator>Bennett, Walter H., Jr.</dc:creator>
<dcterms:abstract>In an interview session taking place on April 24 and May 5, 2007, William A. Johnson tells how he grew up on a farm in Harnett County, North Carolina, before becoming an attorney and active public citizen.  Johnson describes his childhood on the farm, his primary school education, and his experience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an undergraduate and a law student.  Born in Lillington, North Carolina, 1920, Johnson lived on his parents’ farm near Buies Creek, North Carolina.  Johnson recounts his family’s links to the area and his grandparents’ memories of the Civil War.  As a child and adolescent, Johnson helped cultivate tobacco, pick cotton, and slaughter cattle and hogs.  Johnson describes his impressions of relationships between whites and blacks in his community (pages 10-11 and 22-26) as warm and caring but with invisible boundaries between the races.  Johnson’s uncle Paul Green, a famous playwright, played a formative role in Johnson’s views of race relations and capital punishment.  Johnson attended two years of college at Campbell College (now Campbell University) while living at home, then finished his undergraduate education at Chapel Hill.  He failed the comprehensive exam required to graduate, but met his future wife, Mildred Marshbanks, on graduation day.  All three of his sisters also attended the Women’s College in Greensboro, a testament to his parents’ belief in the value of education.  Johnson recollects that he always wanted to become a lawyer because he understood their influence and importance in a community.  He attended law school at UNC-Chapel Hill from September 1941 to June 1944. The May 8, 2007 session covers additional detail about Johnson’s childhood memories, education at UNC, law practice, family, public service, involvement with Democratic politics, experiences as a judge, and work with bar associations.  Johnson describes the trial of Rory Matthews, the hanging of Johnny Purvis, and the “hanging tree” in the Lillington courthouse square.  He discusses his experience in law school during World War II (pp 44-46; 51-52) and his embarrassment about being rejected from the armed forces during the war.  He married Mildred Marshbanks immediately after graduating from law school, on June 17, 1945.  After a few months living in Richmond, Virginia, the couple returned to Lillington, North Carolina, where Johnson opened a law office.  He tells stories about memorable cases from his early law practice (pp 52-52; 59-61), where clients found him through word of mouth.  He also names several mentors (Franklin T. Dupree, Sr.; Neil Salmon; Lee Chaffin; and Duncan Wilson) and addresses legal ethics.  During the late 1940s and 1950s Johnson worked on several Democratic political campaigns, although he never himself ran for public office.  In 1960 Governor Terry Sanford appointed Johnson Commissioner of Revenue, in which capacity he served until he was appointed to serve the remaining term of a deceased Superior Court Judge in 1964.  Johnson describes his experience as a judge, his views of the court system’s inefficiencies, his philosophy as a judge, his views of mediation, and memories of cases he tried.  After his brief tenure as a judge, he returned to private practice in January 1967.  In one memorable case, Johnson served as the court-appointed lawyer in State v. Waxton, a capital case in the early 1970s.  The case went to the Supreme Court, which declared the death penalty unconstitutional as enforced in North Carolina.  Johnson also served as Harnett County Attorney and as attorney for Campbell University.  Johnson discusses his views on lawyers’ duty to provide pro-bono service, his reasons for being a lawyer, his methods of dealing with clients, his reasons for working with the Bar Associations, and his chairmanship of the State Bar Committee that studied a professional responsibility code in 1979. This third section of the interview, from May 15, 2007, focuses on his public service and his opinions of the legal profession and politics.  Johnson served on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees from 1961 to 1972.  He was also one of the original members of the UNC system’s Board of Governors, serving as a member from 1972 to 1988 and as chair from 1976 to 1980.  The Board of Governors dealt with routine matters such as resource allocation and inter-institutional policy decisions.  During Johnson’s tenure as chair the Board also interacted with the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now Health and Human Services) in its efforts to shift the racial demographics of student bodies on various campuses.  Johnson briefly discusses the development of his liberal beliefs, which he attributes mainly to reading.  He describes other members of the Board, including Julius Chambers and UNC President William Friday, and contacts with other notable figures such as Frank Porter Graham and Terry Sanford (pp 110-111, 118-119).  In 1971 and 1972 Johnson served as a member of the state Board of Higher Education.  He voices his opinion about the differing quality of the state’s public schools and university system, as well as the problem of re-segregation in public schools.  Johnson’s other civic commitments included serving as Vice-Chairman of the Campbell Board of Trustees in 1952-53 and advising the UNC Center for Civil Rights.  Johnson comments on the barriers to people without financial resources running for public office.  He also describes his involvement with the Baptist church and his disappointment with the direction the church has taken. In this fourth and final section of the interview, on July 11, 2007, Johnson reflects on cultural and societal changes he has witnessed during his lifetime.  He expresses concern about inequities and inefficiencies in the criminal justice system, wrongful convictions in capital cases, and the politicization of judicial appointments and the judicial system.  He offers his opinions about the changing motivations and characteristics of legal professionals, as well as advice to lawyers and public figures.  He laments the contentious nature of contemporary American society, the inequitable distribution of economic resources, and voter apathy.  He discusses his views of Biblical literalism, sin, belief in a higher being, and the need for tolerance of other religious beliefs.  Finally, he describes his love of gardening.</dcterms:abstract>

April 24, 2007 and May 5, 2007 Tape 1, Side A: Walter Bennett: Bill, let‟s begin, if it‟s okay with you, in talking about your childhood, where you grew up, who your parents were and anything you want to say about your family history. William (Bill) Johnson: Well, my parents were natives of Harnett County. My father was named Alton Glenn Johnson, my mother was named Mary Green Johnson. They had their early childhood within, perhaps, a mile and one-half of each other, and spent most of their married life within a mile or so of their early homes. I was born here in Lillington, North Carolina, September 1, 1920. My parents were living here in Lillington after my father returned from service in World War I. Prior to going into service he had operated a small store here in Lillington but had, pretty early on, decided he‟d rather have something that would permit him to be outside, and having been raised on a farm, he decided once he was back here to close the store and go into farming. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 3 After about a year, I think I was somewhere around one year old, he moved to a farm approximately three miles north of Lillington and we lived there until 1925. At that time my parents bought a farm near Buies Creek, North Carolina, about a mile and a half outside Buies Creek, and that‟s where my parents spent the rest of their lives. My father died when he was seventy, September 11, I believe, 1959, and my mother continued to live on the farm by herself until she died in 1992 at age ninety-four. Both of my parents had reasonably good health, and my father did succumb to a heart attack at age seventy. My mother spent no time in a hospital, except for one incident, until she went to the hospital for some surgery and died during the course of the surgery. I have three sisters, all younger than myself. Two of my sisters are still living. My older sister, I lost her a little over a year ago now. So, by way of summary, I guess I could say I‟ve spent all of my life here in Harnett County, except for a brief period when I got out of law school, in Richmond, Virginia. That was a short experience and lasted only about five months, so well, actually to be correct four months; and other than that I‟ve been right here in Harnett County, raised on a farm within about five miles of Lillington. So, I haven‟t strayed very far from the tree. WB: Tell me a little bit about the farm. What sort of farm was it? What did you all grow? What was your participation in all that? WJ: It was what one might identify as a typical Harnett County farm. We grew tobacco, cotton, corn, small grain—wheat and oats—and soy beans. The economic mainstay, of course, was tobacco. It was a hard-working farm. My father had a very high work ethic. He worked hard himself, and he believed his children should learn to work and I think we did, learned valuable lessons certainly. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 4 And my mother had the same work ethic, even though she taught school early in life. I think she was the youngest school teacher ever employed in Harnett County. I think she started teaching school when she was sixteen years old. And that didn‟t last too long because her mother died, leaving five children, and my mother undertook the burden of raising those children. So actually my mother raised two families, her sibling family and then her own family, myself and my three sisters. My father was not an educated person. I think he went through the seventh grade. But, he had a very sharp mind and was particularly skilled with numbers. He could do numbers in his head better than a lot of people could do them with a pencil and a piece of paper. He was very basic in his beliefs. Work hard, treat other people right, do whatever you tell people you will do, and I think had a very happy and very successful life in that respect. WB: Do you know how your mother and father came to meet? WJ: Well, their homes were within about one mile of each other on the same road and they knew each other growing up as children. And then, my mother of course, walked by my father‟s home going to school from her home to Buies Creek Academy, which was the forerunner of Campbell University. Her home was about two miles from Buies Creek Academy, and my father‟s home was about a mile from Buies Creek Academy, and she would walk by my father‟s home on her way to school. When, I don‟t know. I guess maybe a year or two before the war started, before my father went in the service, they had a pretty serious relationship that had developed to that point and were beginning to think that maybe someday they might get married. Then that plan got interrupted by his military service. When he came home from France, he Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 5 stopped in New York City and bought a ring which he gave to my mother when he got back here. One of the grandchildren, her grandchildren, still has that ring even today. That child happened to get that ring because she was born without any eyesight, and she was the only disabled grandchild in the family. I think my mother felt she ought to get that ring. As a matter of fact, when she got married about three years ago to a young man, fully sighted, [pause] she wore that ring that my father bought in 1919, I guess. So pretty soon after he got back here from France, they got married. WB: Do you know anything about his service in France? What sort of—? WJ: Yes, he was stationed at one point in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, which was on or near the Ohio River, and he was there in the wintertime. He used to tell me about it when I‟d complain about the cold here, having to work outside in the cold. I guess I‟d try to use the cold for an excuse not to work. He‟d say, “Cold won‟t hurt you. I spent the winter at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. Cold enough the Ohio River froze over to the extent you could walk across it and we only had a couple of thin blankets.” So, no sympathy there. Then he went to France, and I suppose because he had experience running a store here in Lillington, they put him in the Quartermaster Corps. And while he was there, he was ultimately assigned the responsibility of operating, of all things, a candy factory, if you could imagine somebody running a candy factory while that war was going on. [pause] There were two fellows who ultimately became his brothers-in-law, one was named Hugh Green, the other was named Paul Green. They were my mother‟s brothers. They were in France at the same time, and he had some contact with them but not a lot. But he had a pretty solid job I suppose. He had somebody to drive him around, even Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 6 though he was not a commissioned officer but because, I guess, of the responsibility with the candy factory. And they were out slugging in the mud—slogging, I guess I should say, in the mud. I think he learned a lot from his experience over there, and I think he saw it on balance, as a very valuable lesson. WB: Do you [pause] know anything in particular about your great-grandparents and—? I assume they were also from Harnett County. WJ: I do. In fact, I‟ve got on my property here in Lillington, where my home is located, a log house in which my maternal great-grandparents were born and reared. It was built sometime before 1837, because on that date, my great-grandparents, my mother‟s grandparents, got married, October 31, 1837, and reared a family in this log house and they were farmers. Hard working people again, but I think a good, honest, respected people in the community. Now, on the other side, on my father‟s side, we [pause] had a little different outlook on life I guess, because one of my father‟s uncles killed a man. They took him and put him in a wagon, covered him up with corn. You know, corn that had been pulled and had shucks on it, and hauled him to South Carolina. Took him out of the state. He left South Carolina and went to Texas and became, I suppose, a good, law-abiding citizen in Texas. Raised his family out there. So my father had kin in Texas, by reason of this episode. WB: This would have been your father‟s uncle? WJ: My grandfather‟s brother. WB: Your grandfather‟s brother. You know anything, the details of how that killing came about? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 7 WJ: There was an altercation as I understand it, here in Lillington, and a black man was involved and he shot the black man. I do not know what motivated the altercation in the first place. I don‟t know how it got started. WB: This was the family that spirited him to South Carolina? WJ: Yes, it was my father‟s family that did that. WB: On either side, were any of your relatives that you know of involved in the Civil War? WJ: Yes. My mother‟s uncle, a fellow named Dan Green, was in service, in Confederate service, in the Civil War. He became a Captain at some point before his service was over. I don‟t know a lot about particular battles in which he was engaged. But luckily he was one of those that did come home, and for many years I had the sword which he carried. But then my mother‟s brother, Hugh, decided he would like to have that sword, and I gave it to him. I guess it‟s still in Hugh‟s family, he‟s the one living. My parents remembered—their parents did rather—incidents in the Civil War. I don‟t know that Sherman himself, but at least some of Sherman‟s contingents, came right up the road in front of the house where I was raised—the home where my father lived and the home where my mother lived—and right on up beyond another home where my grandfather Green‟s brother, Tom Green, lived ultimately. Of course, none of them were in the service, and you hear a lot of incidents about that. One of the things I was told was that a younger brother was plowing in front of the homeplace, the Green homeplace, when they came through, and they just went out in the field and unhitched his mule from the plow, took his mule away! He was just a young boy at that time. They took what little they had. My family never had much in the way of worldly possessions, but the Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 8 little bit they did have, they took and hid in a swamp area about a half a mile behind the home, called „the juniper,‟ which was a very thick, heavily wooded area. That‟s where they hid some of the mules and also their meat—hams and things of that sort and whatever few little possessions they had, they thought to be of any value. One of the interesting episodes related to that involved a Union soldier who was shot, wounded, and when they got, not to my grandfather‟s house, but to his brother‟s house, which was just maybe a quarter of a mile on up the road, they told the lady there that they had this soldier, one of their mates who had been severely wounded and was just not able to travel and wanted to know if they could leave him with her to look after. And she agreed they could, so they left him there. She put him in an upstairs bedroom. This man was apparently a cabinet maker in civilian life, and when he had recovered somewhat, he said, “You know, if you bring me some tools and some wood I‟d like to make you something for looking after me.” She did, and he made a chest of drawers, and he made it in such a way that it was so large it would not go out the door. Couldn‟t get it through the door! And that chest of drawers is still in that upstairs bedroom in this house over on that road about a mile or two from here. An interesting part of that—and how much of this is fact, Walter, who knows? WB: Yeah…. A story. It‟s a story. WJ: But in any event, that sometime after this first contingent of Union soldiers had left their mate there, another group came along. In the course of their stop at this house they told this lady, “Well, you need to get out of this house, we‟re going to burn it.” And she said, “Well, if you do you‟re going to burn up one of your own.” She told them the story of what had happened, and they went upstairs and checked and there he Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 9 was. They believed, of course, what she had told them and so they didn‟t burn the house. The house is still right over there today on that piece of property. I don‟t know of any other incidents out of the Civil War that my ancestors had any particular involvement with. I know that they knew people, of course, who were killed. Same thing was true in World War II. My daddy came back, my mother‟s two brothers came back, but there were other men from the community who did not get back. WB: You said that your father believed in hard work and so forth. Describe if you can what the routine would have been as a child on the farm. What your participation was? WJ: All right. The creature comforts that we know today, such as running water, electricity and air conditioning were not a part of my early life. The farmhouse we had was comfortable. Incidentally, on that—initially it was two rooms. My father helped build it. Somebody else owned the property at that time, a neighbor, but he helped him work on that house, those two rooms, never even expecting, I‟m sure, that someday he might end up living there. But any how, it had been added to, of course, by the time my people had acquired it in 1925. Had fireplaces for the heat, in which we, of course, burned wood. Had a wood cook stove and we had oil lamps, kerosene with a wick, and at some point it got to the point that they acquired something called an “Aladdin lamp” which had a kind of a cone that the traditional oil wick lamp did not have. It made the light much more brilliant. Anyhow, this was my routine. It was my job in the morning to build a fire in the fireplace next to the kitchen, I mean when I was like six or seven, eight years old! Then as I got older it was my job to go and milk the cows before breakfast. Sometimes it was Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 10 one cow, sometimes it was two. At one point, I was milking as many as three cows, twice a day. Then I would come back, get ready for school, have my breakfast and go to school. Come home after school, and then work either at getting wood into the house or feeding the mules or whatever. Then dinner, supper it was to us, and then my school work and then to bed. In the summer of course, it was in the tobacco patch. Topping tobacco, pulling suckers, looping tobacco, hanging tobacco, and it was hard, but it was interesting. You never imagine how much you can learn in a tobacco patch or cotton patch with a bunch of older men who already started having the experiences of life, and you were about fourteen or fifteen years old. They‟d begin talking about their nighttime activities and their weekend activities, and their drinking, and got a lot of insight into life by listening to these fellows talk. Then, most of the people who worked around the tobacco barn itself, doing the looping, which many people of course have no notion at all as to what I‟m talking about, but this is putting the tobacco leaves on a stick so you can hang the stick of tobacco in the barn and cure it. These were usually, for the most part, black ladies. And they, they have an attitude toward life and a sense of fun out of life that you don‟t find in a lot of places anymore. And some of the best music I ever heard in my life was these black ladies singing at that tobacco barn while they were working. Singing hymns, spirituals and other tunes. And, great stories from them about “hants.” They—. WB: What we would call “hants” or “haunts”? Those— WJ: Yes. They lived across the creek that ran between where they lived and where we lived and, gosh, I suppose they really believed what they were saying. They Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 11 seemed to be completely sincere in their belief, but anyhow, they would walk to work, and there was a foot-log across the creek. This is a log that people would put across the body of water so you could walk from one side to the other, and when they‟d go through that swamp they said, “If I can get to that creek before that „hant‟ gets me.” “Get across that creek, „hant‟ won‟t cross the water.” That was their belief. And of course, none of them got caught, there was nothing to that. But black people played a very important role in my life. We had a lady named, well, I think the midwife at my birth was a black lady. In fact I‟m sure of that, because I understand it‟s true. WB: So you were born at home, then? WJ: All four of us. My mother never went to a hospital with the birth of either myself or my three siblings and fortunately had no serious problems and all three of us were healthy kids, except my baby sister. She was born with a condition on her spine— a growth on her lower spine—and the doctors in this area told my mother and my father that there‟s really nothing we can do about this and she may live two or three years. But there‟s a fellow up in Baltimore, Maryland, who worked in Maryland at John Hopkins University, named Doctor Dandy, who has been doing some very advanced surgery in this area and if we can get her up there maybe he can help her. So they arranged it somehow, and my mother and father took my baby sister to see this doctor in Maryland, and he did the surgery, and the surgery was successful. She‟s still living today in Charlotte. And when it was all over and they were ready to come home, my dad asked the hospital, “Now you know,” he said, “I don‟t have a lot of money but I don‟t expect Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 12 you all to do this for nothing. I want to pay you for what you‟ve done.” The bill was fifty dollars. That‟s all they—. WB: [laughs] What year would this have been? WJ: This would have been in 1928. Until this day I have a very warm feeling for John Hopkins University. And every time I see where they‟ve got another big research grant, and you probably know better than I do, that they‟re one of the major recipients of research money in the whole country, I feel good about it, and I thought, boy, you know, how wonderful: here a couple of farm people from North Carolina, they would do that for you. And, anyhow, in the summer, back to the matter of work routine, it was up in the morning at maybe four o‟clock—. WB: It‟d be before light. WJ: Oh, yes, always before light. I mean, you had to be in the field at work by sunlight, and you stayed there until dusk. We used mules; my father would not use horses. Some of the neighbors did have horses. His belief was that a horse ate more than a mule and really didn‟t have the stamina of a mule. I talked to some other people in later years about that, and I think from what they tell me, he was correct. But, we had some mules, and I got to love some of those old mules that I plowed, and when one of them died, just had to cry a little bit when they took them off to wherever they carried them. But then, when I got old enough, by the time I was fifteen or sixteen, I had to cure tobacco. This meant staying at the tobacco barn all night and putting wood in the furnace to keep the temperature at the desired level. And work, you know, you sleep a little bit, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 13 but you couldn‟t sleep soundly or without interruption. And then you‟d go to the field and go to work and work all day and go back to the tobacco barn that night. And—. WB: There was a real expertise to curing, to getting the leaves right and getting them to turn at the right time, wasn‟t there? WJ: You had to start out at what we called “do the yellowing,” and you did that at about ninety to ninety-five degrees. Then, the next stage is what they called, “drying the leaf.” At this point you‟d get your temperature up to about 140, 150, that really set the color. You had to look at the tobacco hanging in the barn to tell when you needed to “raise the heat” as we called it. You needed to go from the “yellowing” heat to the “drying” heat and then from the drying heat to what we called “killing out.” And at this point you‟re at about 175, and that‟s when most of the tobacco barns caught on fire, when you were at that high heat. There was a skill element involved in curing, and I know one of my big disappointments was that some of the people in my community, about the time we were finishing harvesting tobacco in this area, they were starting in Canada. People in Canada apparently needed expert curers. A lot of young people in this area, young men I should say, would go to Canada after they had finished with the crop here and cure tobacco in Canada and made unbelievable wages, unbelievable compared to what they were getting around here. And that was something I always wanted to do, but my father would never let that happen. WB: School would have begun by then probably. WJ: Oh, yes. Absolutely, or if not school, you had to be picking cotton. And you know there was a time, Walter, when the schools would start and then tobacco, I Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 14 mean cotton, opened and was ready to be picked and we‟d take a two-week hiatus in school so the kids could pick cotton! Two things I wanted to do very much, well a lot of things I wanted to do, my father wouldn‟t let me do, and my mother wouldn‟t, too, of course. They were always together on what the kids could or could not do; but to go to Canada and cure tobacco was one of them and the other one, I wanted to get a job as a long haul truck driver and see the country. WB: What age would you have been? WJ: I was about eighteen or nineteen when I had that crazy idea, and that didn‟t come to fruition either. Now, I did get to experience the truck just a little bit, four or five years ago. I knew some people up in Ashe County where they grew Christmas trees. In fact, I had a few Christmas trees up there myself, and I was telling the lady who ran this operation—she had lost her husband about then—she said, “Well, I tell you, I‟ll set you up so you can go on a trip with one of my people, hauling.” So she did, and I got in the eighteen wheeler with a cab-over and sleeping quarters and what not, and rode with him all the way to Florida with a load of Christmas trees. That was really quite an interesting experience. I‟m going to do it again, too, because you see another side of life that you don‟t see here. I had always heard that the best places to eat are where the truck drivers stop. It isn‟t true. WB: [laughs] WJ: They don‟t eat any more. They eat fast food like everybody else. I never got a decent meal on that whole trip! But it was fascinating to see how these fellows operate, and some of these truck stops are unbelievable. We, we pulled in at one truck stop, I Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 15 think it was in upper Florida, and there were over a hundred trucks parked there in that one truck stop, and it had these fascinating truck washing equipment. For sixty dollars you pull your truck in to this area with these tremendous power jets and wash that truck and trailer and make it bright shiny in fifteen or twenty minutes. Gas pumps on either side, fuel tanks on either side of the truck. Whole thing is automated. Driver pulls up between two of these pumps, gives somebody inside his ID number over speakerphone, gets out starts putting the gas in this truck on either side. Filling two tanks at the same time and then they‟re on the road again. Of course, what fascinated me about it was the number of places these people were going, and the different kinds of things they‟re hauling. WB: Where do you think this yen first came from as a young man, to be a truck driver? WJ: Reading and experiencing new things. Reading about other parts of the world. WB: What were the schools like that you attended, and this is prior to college, in grammar school and on up? WJ: I had the good fortune to go to excellent schools. I had the good fortune of having excellent teachers. I wish every kid in the public schools of North Carolina today could be exposed to the kind of teachers I had when I was in elementary school or high school. I was fortunate in the high school level, because Campbell College had become at that time, ran the high school for the Harnett County kids in that school district. So we didn‟t go to a public school. We went to this high school operated by Campbell Univer—College as it was then. I guess today somebody would probably call it a prep Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 16 school, but you didn‟t have to pay fees or dues or anything of that sort. There was some arrangement between the county and Campbell, and as a result of that, my high school teachers were mostly, in fact without exception, my high school teachers were the same people who were doing college level teaching at the University, Campbell University. WB: It was then called Campbell School? WJ: Campbell College. It was called Buies Creek High School, but the school was operated by Campbell. The professors, the teachers, were faculty from the Campbell faculty. I had the same English teacher in high school that I had when I got to Campbell. I went two years in Campbell, which was then a junior college, so I finished high school in ‟37. Go to Campbell for two years and then go to Chapel Hill. But, so I really was very fortunate in that respect. WB: Were there any teachers in particular, anywhere along the way, that stuck out as especially influential? WJ: Yes. My first grade teacher, Ms. Markham, was an absolutely wonderful woman who loved, I think, every one of us just like she would have loved her own kids. My fifth grade teacher, a lady named Ethel Broadhurst was ahead of her time in terms of concepts of life, of what life ought to be like. But she had experience; she was married to a tobacconist, and she had spent sometime in South America. He died, and she came to Buies Creek. She had one child, and interestingly enough in her second marriage, married a fellow who ran a tobacco warehouse in Fayetteville. I had a Latin teacher in high school and in college named Mabel Powell. She was probably the most demanding teacher I‟ve ever had and knew more about grammar, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 17 sentence structure, things of that sort, than anybody I have ever known. In fact she wrote a book on that very subject which has just recently been re-reprinted. In Chapel Hill, interestingly enough, I took what I thought was a crip-course called Ancient Art and it turned out not to be a crip-course at all but one of the most fascinating courses I ever had. That professor was excellent. He gave me something about early art and Greece and the early Italian and the British painters. You know I think one of the things, at least for me, Walter, that tells me this teacher was really good is what you remember that you bring away from that class. Maybe at the time you were there you didn‟t think it was particularly important. But then, later on you begin to realize just how much you got. I had a History professor named Dr. A. R. Newsome who was very, very good. WB: This was all through Chapel Hill? WJ: Chapel Hill. My law school professors were all outstanding, I thought. I guess Mr. Breckenridge maybe, Freddy B. McCall also, and of course, Alfred Coates. I‟d say amongst all my professors those were the three who left the most with me. I was fortunate, and it‟s just purely luck of the draw to have been exposed to excellent teachers all the way through my school experience. WB: You mentioned particularly your father‟s values and their effect on you. Do you have any recollections of any specific instances that stand out along that line where you observed him or he instructed you in some way? WJ: Well, we had tenant farmers. A tenant farmer, you probably know is somebody who lived on the land you owned. So these were people living on land owned by my father. In that day and time, the term sharecropper was used quite often. That Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 18 meant they did their farming on shares. The landowner would furnish a place for these people to live, a home, and would furnish the land and would furnish the fertilizer and the tenant would do the work and then they‟d split the crop. WB: Was this fifty-fifty? WJ: Fifty-fifty was our rate. Most of these people, well I shouldn‟t say most, but a number of the people did not really know very much about numbers. How to be sure they were getting their fair share. And my daddy was absolutely scrupulous about seeing that they got exactly what they were supposed to get when he could‟ve taken advantage of them if he had wanted to. My daddy, not only did he do the traditional farming, but he had to have something going on in the winter. A lot of farmers spent their winters sitting around a store heater telling stories and having fun. My daddy had something else going on. He would buy cattle and he‟d fatten them and then kill them and then he would peddle the meat. This was before the days of „Grade A‟ restaurants and health inspectors. He had an incident about that. I‟ll tell you about that in a minute. One of my jobs after he got into that, was when I‟d get home from school on maybe Thursday or a Friday would be to slaughter cattle, and there were afternoons where I might kill two or three and dress them. We had a place rigged up down near one of the tobacco barns that we could put this cow, put hooks in the leg behind the hoof of the cow and pull her up and open the cow up and dress the cow, taking out the intestines and what not. I‟d take a rifle and go out into the pasture to where the one we were going to slaughter was and shoot the heifer or steer or whatever and use a tobacco slide to move the cow from here to this place where we were going to dress her. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 19 Then he would peddle. He would cut this meat up into roasts and steaks and spareribs or whatever and then, had a Model A Ford and he had a rack on the back of it, and he‟d put this meat in tubs on the back of this Ford and then he would go around and sell it in that community and here in Lillington. He did the same things with hogs also, and killing hogs was a big day on the farm. And [pause] that was an interesting experience too. WB: Bill, I want you to describe that at some point, the hog killing. WJ: Well, I‟ll just do it right now. The hogs would be in a pen, and here again we‟d take a rifle and go down to the hog pen where they were located, shoot them, put them on a slide, and bring them up to the house where there was a trench with a fire in it; and over that fire was something called a hog vat. This was a container about maybe eight feet long and about three and half feet wide and maybe fifteen inches deep. Had a metal bottom on it and you put this vat over the fire, a wood fire, and when the water was boiling you‟d take this hog and put the hog into the vat. You put ropes under the hog so that when one side of the hog, the side that was on the bottom to start with, had had enough heat that you knew the hair would pull out easily; then you‟d use those ropes to flip the hog over and put the other side down deep in the water. Killing was sort of gruesome because as soon as you shot the hog or as soon as you shot the cow too for that reason, it was very important to get to that animal and cut the throat so that the animal can bleed; because if you don‟t, you just leave that blood in the body, then you ruin the meat. So, as soon as they would… [End of Tape 1, Side A] WB: We were talking about the process of hog killing. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 20 WJ: Yes. Well, after the carcass had been in this hot water long enough to make the hair pull out easily, you take the hog out of the vat and then getting that hair off was really, really a task. Part of it you could pull loose by hand but you also had to use something called a scraper to get the toughest hair. Then you put the hog on what we called a hog gallows. This was two posts at an angle, peaked at the top, sort of like the top of a chalet at either end of the pole between those two, and you would hang the hogs on this pole. And you would take and slit each of the hind legs at a point just below the hoof and just inside the tendon and stick a wooden pole, maybe two feet long and a couple inches in diameter into each slit. One leg went on one side of the long pole and one leg on the other side, and the hog hung down from this gallows. Then somebody would open the hog, remove all of the entrails and other organs, and then leave the hog there on this gallows maybe all day. And I tell you, it was quite a pretty sight to see ten or twelve big hogs all lined up hanging on this gallows in a row. Then maybe the next day the hog would be cut into parts, you cut out the shoulder, you cut out the hams, you cut the sides. You would take the intestines, put them in a pot, boil the intestines, then after they had been boiling for a good long while, take the intestines out of this pot. People would clean the intestines and you‟d use that intestine when you got ready to stuff the sausage. You took certain parts of the hog, cut it into small parts and then put it in what we called a sausage grinder or sausage mill, ground it up. Then put it into a little hand operated device, everything was operated by hand, and force this ground up meat into this intestine and you have something maybe an inch and a half in diameter and Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 21 sometimes as much as three or three-and-a-half feet long. Then you hang that up in a smoke house to dry and cure. Once it was cured then when you‟d get ready to cook it, you‟d cut off a link. The shoulders and the hams were put—at least at my daddy‟s home, he had something called a smokehouse—and on one side of that smokehouse there was a big, like what I‟d call a wooden tray. He‟d fill that full of salt, put the raw, freshly slaughtered pork, hams and shoulders, into that salt, covered them with salt. Let it stay there for several weeks and then take it out of the salt and put black pepper and borax on it, put it in a guano sack and hang it up in the smokehouse. Maybe next fall you‟d have a good ham ready to cut and cook. WB: What time of year would the hog killing go on? WJ: In late fall or early winter. I don‟t know if you ever heard the phrase, “Cold enough to kill hogs,” or not, but the temperature had to get to a level, had to get low enough so that the fresh meat would not spoil. Because we didn‟t have refrigerators and freezers, at least for a while we didn‟t. It was 1936 before there was any electricity in my home. So, you had to depend on the weather to preserve your fresh meat and had to depend on the well to keep the milk cool. We had a well. We‟d put milk in a jar or a jug and lay it down into this well and that‟s what kept the milk cool. WB: So there was no ice house or anything like that. WJ: We did not have an ice house. My mother, I heard my mother talk about ice and she was very, very careful that you didn‟t throw any ice away once we got to the point that we did have ice. She said she could remember when somebody would come by Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 22 their home when she was a child peddling ice and they would buy a nickel‟s worth of ice. How they would wrap it up in newspapers to preserve it. Now at some point along the way my daddy would buy a block of ice. He‟d come to Lillington and buy a 300 pound block of ice that was made right here in Lillington, and take it home and he‟d wrap that up, cover it up with sawdust and that would preserve it from melting. This was later on, of course. WB: You mentioned the, I forget exactly how you put it, but the black people who were working on your farm that had an important influence on you. Can you talk a little bit more about that? You told us about their singing and their demonstration of the joy in life and so forth. WJ: Well, I have a lot of joy Walter, and I have a lot of sadness about that. My best playmate was a black kid. We had a lady named Bessie McClean who cooked and helped my mother. My mother worked on the farm. I‟ve seen my mother on a scaffold painting an outbuilding, I‟ve seen her in the field. My mother was a very literate lady, wrote extremely well. But we had Bessie and Floyd McClean. They had one little boy. He got sick, and my dad took him to Duke University Hospital, and the little fellow died. My dad brought that kid home from Duke Hospital in the back seat of his Model A Ford automobile. They had the service; that was a very sad time in my life. WB: This was your playmate? Your friend? WJ: Yes. It took me a while to deal with that. WB: How old would you have been then? WJ: Twelve. Eleven or twelve, I believe. WB: And what was his name? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 23 WJ: His name was Ernest as I recall. WB: Ernest McClean. And—. I‟m sorry. WJ: Floyd and Bessie were just wonderful people, but of course, Floyd would mistreat Bessie every once in a while. Even so, I think they really loved each other, and they were really hurt. Then there was a black man named Uncle Jerry who was a preacher, who taught me a lot about a lot of things. He was very religious and his wife worked some for my mother in the kitchen. I‟ve seen her many times sit in front of the fire with what they called a cooling iron. For some reason or another at one point, a lot of people, black ladies, wanted their hair to be straight, and they had a practice of buying something that, I don‟t know whether it‟s a special kind of grease or what it was, Walter. But it was in a container sort of like a salve in terms of context and in the way it looked and they would put this on their hair. Then they‟d take what they called an iron, I‟d seen her many times sit by the fireplace and put it right down in the coals in the fireplace and let it get hot, like almost red hot it would seem to me. Then she would pull it, it had teeth like a comb, and she would pull that curling iron or comb or whatever through her hair, and sometimes you would even hear the hair sizzling. But it had this compound on it and it would straighten that hair. I mean when she got through with it, it was straight and it was black and it was bright shiny from that material that she had put on it. But, she was important to me. Another one was a black lady named Calla Lily who helped my mother. One of the reasons my mother had help, my daddy had migrant laborers before migrant laborers Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 24 had ever been heard of, actually. There were four boys in Georgia, Hoods, who came up every summer to help us with tobacco. WB: These would have been black or white? WJ: They were white young men and they lived in the house. My house was large enough that my daddy and mother provided housing for them and my mother prepared all their food. Well, when we were housing tobacco, barning tobacco, there might be twenty or twenty five people involved and my mother would fix lunch. We all ate lunch, all the hands as we called them, they‟d eat lunch right there on the farm. And of course, for obvious reasons she had to have some help because no way she could handle that all by herself. And then there was another one, a boy named Bony, that I grew up with. Bony worked with me in the field many, many times and he had a bad problem with liquor. Everybody tried to get him to at least cut down. I told him, I said, “Bony you‟re going to get drunk some night and you‟re going to burn yourself up.” And unfortunately, one night I got a telephone call from the fire department over near Buies Creek, and I went over there and there was Bony out there on the ground. He had gone to sleep in his home, he lived alone, he never got married. I guess he got in the bed drunk, smoking a cigarette maybe, and set himself on fire, burned himself up. WB: Was he African-American or white? WJ: He was a black man, African-American. I always had a deep sense of regret about Bony because, I‟d go home, you know, I‟d worked in the field all day, I‟m wrapped up with tobacco gum, perspiring and what not. I could take a bath, you know, a shower with hot water and what not. Bony went home and he had nothing like that. I always had Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 25 a guilty feeling about that. As I look back on it now it just wasn��t right. You know, I‟d go home and there‟s my momma fixing me a good hot supper and I could take a hot shower and Bony goes home and nobody there but himself and his bottle, you know. Nobody to cook for him and no hot water to take a bath and what not. That‟s had an impact on the way I think about things. WB: I was going to ask you, what the relations were between the blacks and whites in Lillington at that time from your observation. I guess most of it would have to do with the folks you were working with on the farm, but also—. WJ: Well, I can‟t really say about Lillington. I lived in Buies Creek. I had almost no contact at all with Lillington when I was growing up; didn‟t go to school over there. In my own community the relationship was what I would call warm, caring, but there was a point beyond which you did not go. You didn‟t invite them to go to church with you. They didn‟t come to your church. You didn‟t engage in social events where they were present, probably not even welcomed. But out there on that farm, Walter, and in the field, I mean, we ate together, we played together, we worked together, and never really thought anything about it, you know. They were just different color skinned, but pretty much like the rest of us. But then we knew there was a line you, you just did not step over. WB: They knew the direction. WJ: They knew the direction. I mean, they didn‟t invite me. If they had a birthday party, they didn‟t invite me to that birthday party. If we had one, we didn‟t invite them. They didn‟t invite me to their church, and I didn‟t invite them to my church. And it was something you didn‟t talk about it and invisible yes—but on the other hand as Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 26 solid as the Berlin Wall in the sense that you didn‟t, on certain things, you just didn‟t go across it. WB: When do you think your feelings and attitudes about that line began to—. When did you begin to perceive it and when did you begin perceive that it wasn‟t just or, or whatever you would character—? WJ: I guess maybe, when I was in high school or getting out of high school. I had an uncle that had some very, very strong feelings about this. A fellow named Paul Green and he was way ahead of his time in thinking about human relations as it involved black people and white people. WB: Was this the Paul Green? WJ: Yeah, the one that was in Chapel Hill. He was my mother‟s brother, and he had a very significant impact on me in a lot of respects, both in terms of how I felt about that and also about how I felt on the issue of capital punishment. He wrote a story, you may or may not have heard, about a little fellow named Rassie, a true story, and it occurred on a piece of land that my parents owned and became home. It was about how Rassie cut himself with a Barlow knife and how amazed he was when Rassie bled, that his blood looked just like everybody else‟s blood. And he had some very interesting experiences himself. Which is another story in terms of capital punishment, people being wrongfully convicted and of course that was before the time of DNA. I just saw a story in the paper this morning about two hundred people now have been freed because of DNA. But anyhow, that had an impact, and as I‟ve gotten older I just felt more and more keenly about that. I don‟t really know how to explain it. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 27 WB: How much contact did you have with Paul Green? WJ: A lot. He was very close to my mother because my mother raised him, and in fact he was younger than she of course. Just like she raised the rest of her siblings. When there was any sort of a gathering, it was to my mother‟s home, it was our house they came, and he came quite often and we played baseball together. Then I lived in his house in Chapel Hill the last year I was in law school. He went back to Hollywood to do some more writing and wanted somebody to stay in his house just to look after it. And so I lived there on Greenwood Road, where his home was at that time, and in fact, when I got married I was living there. Mildred and I went back to that house after we were married and lived there until I went to Richmond, Virginia, to start my first job. So, we had a very good and close relationship. WB: One thing I need to get you to do before I forget about it. You use the term „tobacconist‟. What was a „tobacconist‟? WJ: That is a term that was applied to people who either ran a tobacco warehouse or, to who people took their tobacco to be sold, or a buyer, or an auctioneer. It did not apply, at least I never heard it applied, to the people who grew the tobacco. But at least in my experience it was a term used to designate folks who were involved in the marketing of the tobacco. WB: What role did religion play in your childhood and growing up? WJ: Well, I was raised in the Baptist church. Both of my parents professed to be believers, and I think they were. My mother initially was in the Christian church and then when we moved to Buies Creek she wanted to go to the Baptist church and almost didn‟t get in because they had a rule you had to be baptized before you could join that Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 28 church. She was baptized when she joined the Christian church and unfortunately was almost drowned in the pond, Matthews Mill pond where she was being baptized, and from that day forward had a horror of water. The few times we would go to the beach she wouldn‟t even get close to the water‟s edge, and you couldn‟t have paid her to get in a swimming pool. She just put her foot down, and she would not agree to it. And finally Dr. James Archie Campbell, who was not only the founder and president of Campbell College, but also the pastor of the church there in Buies Creek, he finally relented and she joined that church. And we had to go to church every Sunday, church and Sunday school. Had to go to the Baptist Student Union every Sunday night, that was a Baptist organization for young people. I don‟t think it‟s even in existence by that name anymore. Prayer meetings we did not have to go to because Wednesday night we were either studying or working. Vacation Bible School, I didn‟t get to go to Vacation Bible School because we were right in the middle of the farming operation then. But we were very involved in the Baptist Church. My mother was ultimately one of the early female deacons, and that was some other story, too. But they believed in the church, and they believed it important for their children to have a relationship with the church. They wanted their children to join the church and be baptized, and all of us were. Same man that baptized me married me, as a matter of fact. He was another important personality in my life. WB: I was about to ask you about any, other than your teachers, any other people that were sort of mentors or you looked up to—. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 29 WJ: Well, I put Paul Green in that category. I put his brother, Hugh Green in that category because Uncle Hugh taught me how to fish. WB: [laughs] WJ: And he was a great fisherman himself, and he took me on a lot of fishing trips, fresh water fishing. Some of my most pleasant memories today are, gosh—when you knew you and another one were going to be getting up at two o‟clock in the morning, and I couldn‟t even go to sleep, can‟t wait to get to that pond or wherever we were going. Then get out there, and the fog is rising off of the pond because of the difference in the water temperature and the air temperature. Just a wonderful, wonderful experience. He made it possible, possible for me to have those kinds of experiences. Mr. Charlie Howard, also. He was my pastor, and he also taught me bible at Campbell. He was a wonderful teacher. I can even remember today the diagram he gave us on Paul‟s journeys. I can see those things right now on that sheet of paper where Paul went from here to here to here and beyond. He was just a wonderful teacher. Then a fellow named Gier who taught at Campbell that was head of the Boy Scouts. He was our Scoutmaster and well as my teacher. He was significant in that role. Melvin Turlington, a man who lived here in Lillington. He built this office, in fact built my house. Had the most intense desire to learn I believe of anybody I have ever known. Had no formal education at all, but had a tremendous, just innate knowledge in something that would help him know what was right constructually. What would look right, and when he began to get interested in moldings, for example. He would get in his car and drive to Williamsburg, Virginia, and study the moldings in the early Colonial American homes and take pictures and do sketches. He Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 30 became an expert photographer, to the point that he even had his own dark room in his basement and developed first black-and-whites. Then ultimately went to the level of being able to do color photographs. But he taught me something about what a person who really wants to learn, what they can accomplish without going inside an educational facility. He knew more about good architecture than a lot of architects who‟d graduated from N. C. State School of Design or whatever. In fact, some of his most heated arguments involved buildings that he was building that had been designed by an architect, and he‟d just tell them, “You know, you can‟t do it this way, this isn‟t right. It won‟t work.” He would stay with—. I remember one morning he came down here, the mason started doing the corner on this office. Melvin just walked up and looked at it and took his foot and just pushed the whole thing down. It was green, you know. That cement and concrete had not set. The fellow wasn‟t doing it right and didn‟t do it like he wanted. The front on this building, that little porch, he put it up, and one day I was going to my other office and I looked down and it was gone. I said, “Melvin, what in the world happened?” and he said, “Well, I rode by there yesterday and it didn‟t look right. Just didn‟t fit.” So he had the thing torn down and redesigned it. He just had that sort of eye. The sort of fellow that would go to Scotland, for example, and study. I use the word advisedly—not formal study, but old buildings and things of that sort to get an idea of something. He was important because he gave me a sense of doing right, you know, and if it isn‟t right, tear it down and redo it till you get it right. WB: At what age would you have been when you had the contact with him and began to—? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 31 WJ: Well, I started with Melvin in 1945. When I got out of law school I took a job with Reynolds Metal Corporation in Richmond, Virginia. It‟s funny how your life turns. I went to Charlotte, North Carolina to interview with a law firm over there, Tillett and Campbell, and that‟s where I really wanted to go, because they had the reputation of, well, they had always—. I don‟t want this to sound bad either. I don‟t know exactly how to say this, but they had always tried to hire the person that had the top spot in this graduating school as law clerks, and they invited me to come down there and talk to them and they offered me seventy-five dollars a month. This was in 1944. I knew then that Mildred and I were going to get married in June. I said, “Mr. Tillet, there‟s no way I can do that.” And we talked, and I said, “I think I can make it if I could get a hundred dollars a month” and he said, “Well, we can‟t do that. We‟ve never paid more than seventy-five.” So I came back, and I had this opportunity to go Reynolds Metals which was not really my first choice; but anyhow I went up there and interviewed and took a job with Reynolds Metals. Well, about a week after I took that Reynolds Metals job, Mr. Campbell of Tillett and Campbell called me and told me they decided they would want me to come work for them. It was too late. I thought many, many times about how my life would have been, what the direction might have been, if I had gone. I know it turned out Walter, and I‟m not a Presbyterian and I don‟t have a lot of deeply rooted beliefs about destiny and what not, but there‟s so darn many strokes of good luck. I don‟t get the Charlotte job and I‟m disappointed. I get the job in Richmond. I had been there a week, and I decided this is not for me. Good job, you know, lots of opportunities, but I won‟t spend my life in that Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 32 sort of environment. I came back to Harnett County after four months, and I just know my life has been better and happier and more fulfilling because of that. I don‟t have any doubt. You wonder how do you get so darn lucky. How do you get so lucky about a lot of things? One of the biggest disappointments I ever had in my life I guess, for my brother and father more so than me, when I got to Carolina I didn‟t really know anything about anything outside in the real world. Buies Creek is a pretty sheltered environment, I‟m telling you. WB: Would you have been a Junior? WJ: I would have been a Junior. In Everett dormitory. That‟s where I learned to play poker. That‟s where I tried to learn to drink beer, but I could never develop the taste for it. Today I can‟t drink beer. Anyhow, I was fortunate to be able to go to the University of North Carolina. That has been one of the great fortunes in my life, and I did well my first semester there. I looked forward to learn this, that, and the other, and then I got to loafing. And my grades, they dropped down to where I was just getting B‟s and well, at that time the University had a policy which said you had to take an examination at the end of your Senior year in order to graduate. I was nonchalant and lackadaisical about the darn thing. The day I took it I sat on the grass out there in front of Manning Hall—I didn‟t even know at that time that Manning Hall was a law school—and I flunked the durn thing and the result was I could not graduate; and it just about killed my parents. Well, on June 6th, 1941, the day I should have been walking across the platform at either Kenan or Memorial or somewhere to get my diploma, I‟m sitting over yonder at the farm, unhappy and sad, and a friend of mine came along, a boy named Fulton Lanier Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 33 and said, “I‟m fixing to go to Buies Creek to see Mildred Marshbanks. Do you want to ride over there with me?” I said, “Well, yeah, I don‟t have anything else to do.” This was a mile and a half on the other side of Buies Creek from where I lived, and we ride over there and get up there, and there‟s this beautiful blonde girl sitting on her front porch in a rocker. Now we had grown up and gone to the same school, but she was a year ahead of me. She had had her first year at Meredith. Ultimately that‟s the girl I married. I have thought now, what if I had been in Chapel Hill that day to get my diploma? Would this have turned out the way it did? You know, you don‟t get the answers to those kinds of questions, but you do think about it. So at least I say to myself, good luck that they didn‟t want to pay me $100 a month to start with. Good luck that I wasn‟t in Chapel Hill getting that diploma. Because I got my degree later anyhow, you know, but that was a sad day for my parents and I really felt terrible for my mother and daddy because they had done a lot of sacrificing. I had sort of a different career at Carolina from a lot of people, I guess. At one time my dad had four kids in college. Because there were four of us and we were two years apart. See, I was in law school and my three sisters they all went to a woman‟s college and it was a load. I‟m telling you it was a load. There were no scholarship monies, there were no grants and there were no loans. I got to, and I don‟t even know how this happened to tell you the truth, but I got the News and Observer agency for Chapel Hill my senior year at Carolina, I guess. It did pretty well for me as a matter of fact. Now here again, that was not easy. I rode a lot of hard, cold mornings on a bicycle around Chapel Hill throwing newspapers on people‟s front porches, hopefully, but mostly I guess they hit in the bushes because every once in Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 34 awhile I‟d get a complaint. But some of my most interesting experiences when I was at Carolina involved meeting and talking to people who were my subscribers when I would go to collect. Two of them I remember were Dr. Reece Berryhill and Dr. Hedgepeth. Dr. Hedgepeth‟s son is now my optometrist or ophthalmologist in Durham. But, that was another learning experience. Well, anyhow, I just did not give my studies the attention I should have given in under-graduate school. When I got to law school it was a different story because then I knew where I was headed, what I wanted. Well, I had known all along I wanted go to law school. I never thought about anything else even from the early on days. I did try to apply myself when I got into law school. That all turned out alright, but that was a terrible disappointment for my parents, and I wasn‟t happy about it either for that matter. WB: I gather from what you‟ve said earlier that your parents put a high value on education. WJ: They did believe in education, and even though my father was not educated formally, he did believe in education and there was never any question in our household about whether or not we kids would go to college. I mean that wasn‟t even an issue. It was just understood that you‟re going to go through high school and you‟re going to go to college and you‟re going to prepare yourself to do something. I mean, it wasn‟t an option, you know. That���s just the way this is going to be. I‟m grateful that they felt that way. WB: So you went your first two years to Campbell. Was there anything in particular that led you to go there rather than Carolina or some other place? Or was it just because it was convenient? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 35 WJ: The thing that caused me to go to Campbell was because I could live at home and even though the tuition at Carolina then was very modest, certainly compared to what it is today, I could live at home and continue do on the things on the farms [that] I had been doing. I could get those two years behind me at a much less, much lower cost. I didn‟t have to pay any dorm rent; didn‟t have to buy any meals because I‟m eating at my mother‟s table. That was just an economic consideration. My three sisters did the same thing. Campbell is very, very important to my family in that respect because it made it easier. Now, I don‟t have any doubt that my folks would have somehow or another seen that we went if Campbell have not been there. But that made it easier, and I feel more warmly toward Campbell on account of that. WB: You transferred to Carolina after two years of Campbell. How did that come about? Was the ambition to go there eventually anyway? WJ: I had always wanted to go to Carolina. Again, I can‟t explain this. I knew from the word „GO‟, by the time I started thinking about what I would do, that I wanted to be a lawyer. There were no lawyers in my family, and I had no association with anybody who was a lawyer. But I had done a lot of reading, and I had decided that lawyers had played the most significant role in the development of our country, of any single group of people. I just felt that that was what I wanted to do. My mother‟s two younger sisters, Erma and Caro Mae, had gone to Carolina and of course, their brother Paul had gone to Carolina, and I used to go to Chapel Hill to visit him when he lived in a little house on something called The Glen. That house is still there I think, down there right next to where Chancellor Ferebee Taylor used to live. I‟d Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 36 go up there and visit him, and I just sort of, well, I liked the place. So I never gave a thought to going anywhere other than Carolina. WB: Did you go directly from undergraduate school to law school? WJ: Yes, I did. WB: Did you ever consider Duke or any other institution? WJ: No. WB: Always Carolina? WJ: Correct. WB: Anything in the total sum about your experience at Carolina. Where there any professors there or contacts you made there with other students or anything that particularly stand out to you? WJ: Yes. I guess Albert Coates would be the most, I have to be careful about how I say this because all my professors were excellent—. WB: You‟re talking about law school. WJ: Law school. Yes. He had a different slant on the law and teaching law and life that made his courses not just interesting, but actually fascinating, to me at least. And Mr. Breckinridge was just, he just had such skill in teaching the material that he was dealing with. And also, Freddy B. McCall. Real property. All of these had the capacity somehow or other to make you want to learn more. The subject was not a drudge. They‟d bring it to life and make you want to find out more about the things they were talking about. WB: What years were you in law school? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 37 WJ: I went into law school in September of 1941 and I graduated in June of 1944. [End of Tape 1, Side B] Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 38 May 8, 2010 Tape 2, Side A: WB: This is the second interview with W. A. Johnson at his office in Lillington. The date is May 8th, 2007. The last time we spoke you had begun to talk about Rory Matthews and we wanted to go back and pick up on him. What can you tell us about Rory? WJ: Well, Rory was one of the most unique, most interesting persons I‟d ever encountered. Really, a pathetic figure. Illiterate but knew a lot about life. Learned most of it, I think, in North Carolina Central Prison. He used to brag to me about having made friends all over the country. He‟d say, “I‟ve got friends all over everywhere.” I‟d say, “Rory, how‟d you get to meet all these people?” He said, “Well, I met them in prison.” He had absolutely no sense of remorse that I was ever able to detect. I think he probably died believing that he did the right thing when he killed McLeod. He served his time he said and came back here and I think he still lived a sad life. I don‟t believe he had any contact at all with books, had no friends, really, at that time no family of any consequence, and just lived from day to day, I think, spending his nighttime at his little log house and spending the days walking from there into Lillington and hanging around the courthouse. WB: The log house was on your father‟s old place? Is that right? WJ: No. The log house was on a piece of land that was in Rory‟s family. Had been since the 1700‟s; but ultimately when natural circumstances in Rory‟s family became so bad, they put a mortgage on it and then lost it. The mortgage was foreclosed, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 39 and the property passed into the hands of someone else. I now have that log cabin on a piece of property here in Lillington, which I own. WB: And how did you first come to know him? WJ: We were living out in the country about three miles north of Lillington on a farm. About a half a mile north of that farm was the Matthews farm, and the road running from Rory‟s home to Lillington came right by the house in which we were living. WB: This is when you were a child. WJ: I was at that time—well, we moved to that farm when I was one year old, moved from Lillington out to the country. And in 1925, Rory shot Mr. McLeod and prior to that he had visited there, talked to my mother, talked to my father. Walking from his home to Lillington, he‟d stop on the way and visit. It was on these occasions I first got to know Rory and actually I am a little bit in awe, because it was unusual for me to see a man carrying a rifle everywhere he went. I don‟t think he ever came by our house without having that rifle with him. I think, as I stated in the earlier interview, he would tell my mother when she would talk to him about the dangers of guns and guns getting you in trouble. No, he‟d say, he was going to use it to kill McLeod. And he did. WB: What was the dispute between Rory and McLeod? WJ: The dispute was over a piece of dirt, really, which is one of the more frequent reasons for disputes in rural areas at least—landlines, boundary lines. But this is before we had a system of public roads in North Carolina. The custom was for the people in the community to give enough of their land for a roadway running from house to house, community to community. I say “give,” I don‟t Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 40 think they actually conveyed the title; they just in effect gave an easement and said to the community you can use this part of my land for this roadway. The custom was adjoining land owners, for example if you and I owned the joining tracts that this road was coming adjacent to or cross our property, half the roadway would be on your land and half would be on my land. Our dividing line between our properties would be the center line of this roadway. I say roadway, it was really more like a cart path, usually fourteen or sixteen feet wide. Of course automobiles had not taken over at that time. Rory felt while he was willing for some of the Matthews land to be used for this roadway. McLeod, who was the adjoining land owner, was trying to put more than one-half of the roadway on the Matthews property. So it was really a dispute over the exact location. Is the center line going to be right here where the dividing line between our lands fall on the ground or is it going to be a little to the left or a little to the right? Rory thought they were taking too much of his land. When he couldn‟t stop it otherwise he took his rifle and shot McLeod. WB: Do you remember how much time he got for that? WJ: First time he was sentenced to death in the electric chair. He got a new trial on a unique principle of law. We may have talked about this the other day—. WB: We did, but it wasn‟t on the tape. WJ: Ok. He, the sheriff of the county, got the idea that he‟d take some people out to the scene where the shooting occurred and have witnesses who observed the incident tell him where the various people working on the roadway that morning were standing so as to show the position of Rory in relation to where Mr. McLeod was Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 41 standing and where these other witnesses were standing. Then he had a photographer take a picture of these. They weren‟t really the real witnesses, but I guess they were stand-ins or so to speak and take a photograph. These photographs were offered in evidence when the trial was conducted right up here on the hill about three hundred feet from where we are sitting this morning. When Rory got the death sentence his lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court in North Carolina, and one of their arguments was based on the fact that these photographs had been used as substitute evidence. The lawyers said you can‟t do that because we were not present, Rory was not present. He had no opportunity to challenge whether these witnesses or the individuals who witnessed the crime where actually at the locations indicated on the photograph. The Supreme Court agreed and gave a new trial on that premise. It was a case on first impression in North Carolina. I think it was a case of first impression in the entire judicial system in the United States because this case has been studied down through the years in all the evidence courses in all the law schools as far as I know. Came back, had a second trial. This time he was again found guilty, but was sentenced for life, and he went off to prison. He got out in about 1944, which was about the time I came back to Lillington to start practicing law. So between ‟26 when he killed McLeod and when I came here to practice law in January 1, 1945, I had not seen Rory. I‟m over at the courthouse one day, and there he is walking down the hall. He was a rather diminutive figure, about 5‟5 or 5‟6, had on a black derby, black tuxedo jacket, black tux pants, a white shirt and black shoes with a very sharp point, like the sharpest point you see on some of the ladies shoes today. That was Rory‟s around-the-clock attire. I never saw him dressed otherwise from the day I first saw him at the Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 42 courthouse until he went away from here. He, as far as I know, had no interest in any church, and no interest in any community activities, he just lived within himself I think. Reflected on his memories of his time in prison and what it was like. WB: You said he left here—. WJ: I mean when he died. WB: Oh, okay. WJ: That was not a very good way [for me] to comment on his going on to another world, but that was what I was referring to. WB: You also mentioned the last time we were talking on this general subject something about the hanging tree at the courthouse. WJ: Yes, that hanging tree was located probably seventy-five feet from where we are sitting, right across the street. I should make note of the fact that my office is located in the first block north of the Courthouse Square. Our blocks in Lillington are 300 feet square, so that‟s the reason I said my office is not quite 300 feet from the courthouse, actually. Well, this tree was located on the northeast corner of the Courthouse Square. It was a big oak tree. It was here when I came to Lillington to practice law. A man named Purvis, Johnny Purvis, a migrant or itinerant as I understand, was charged with murdering a brakeman working on the Atlantic Coastline Railroad which ran at that time through Fayetteville, and in to Dunn, Benson, and on North. The murder occurred somewhere between Fayetteville and Dunn. There was a big argument as I understand early on as to where the incident actually took place so as to determine whether the Harnett County court would have jurisdiction or whether it would be a Cumberland County case. Ultimately somebody decided Harnett County was the right Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 43 venue, so he was tried here in this county, was sentenced to death by hanging. I think this was in the late 1800s but I‟m not sure of the date, and was hanged right on that tree. Which unfortunately is now gone because, when they were building a new bridge across the Cape Fear River, they got a lot of the dirt off of this hill that was across the street from where that oak tree was located. They cut the darn thing down and hauled it off. So it‟s no longer there, but it was a big day in Lillington when they had the hanging. WB: Did you witness it? WJ: No. I was not living at that time. I had an uncle, my mother had a brother named John Green who did. He came to Lillington, and he said the town was run over from people from everywhere, very festive. At that time there was no bridge across the Cape Fear River. Cape Fear is about a half a mile north of the courthouse. You came across it this morning. People got from the north side of Cape Fear to the south side on a little wooden flat, like a raft, which was poled. Two men operated it and they used a pole to push the raft back and forth across the river. My uncle said that after the hanging was over, suddenly it just was as if everybody said we just got to get out of town now just as fast as we can. I don‟t understand that psychological movement, but anyhow that was the way he described it. People rushed down to the river to get on that raft to get across, too many would get on the raft and it would start to sink. Some would back off, repeat the process, and he said finally the only way they ever got that raft away from the south bank of the river, the oarsmen stood at the back of the raft, let a few people on, and then they would hold up their poles to keep anymore from getting on the boat. Then they could move across and come back and get another load. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 44 WB: It was almost as if they were fleeing the scene of what they witnessed. WJ: That‟s exactly right. I think finally they realized what a horrible thing they had just witnessed and they wanted to get away from it. That‟s pure surmise on my part, of course. WB: About what time, what would have been the date of this? WJ: I believe it was 1898. I haven‟t checked that date in a long time, and my memory may not be entirely accurate but I think it was ‟98. WB: Do you know when the state discontinued hanging and instituted—? WJ: Sometime in the early 1900s, I believe, Walter. Then the electric chair came along to take the place of a rope of course. WB: One other thing you talked about briefly last time that we might want to revisit because it seems such an odd incident in your life. You said you transferred to Carolina and apparently were doing very well there academically, then along came the comprehensive exam you had to take to graduate and you didn‟t study as hard as you should for that and didn‟t pass it. WJ: I didn‟t study, period, and I flunked it! WB: [laughs] WJ: Flat out, and therefore I couldn‟t graduate. I thought about that a lot when recently I‟ve been reading all of this comment among the educational world about year end, class exams, year end exams for the kids in public school. They have my sympathy. WB: [laughs] What do you think the reason was that you sort of let that slide? Just overconfidence? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 45 WJ: I think it was a combination. Overconfident was one of them. I didn‟t think it would be as tough as it was, and I had really loafed through Carolina to put it lightly. I didn‟t make all A‟s but I still had a fairly decent—I don‟t think we even had grade point averages at that time—just A‟s and B‟s and what not. My recollection is the first semester there I was all A‟s and it went down hill from there. I don‟t think I ever flunked any class, any subject, but I didn‟t do what I should‟ve done, and it cost me. It also taught me. Bad experience for my family. WB: At some point between then and your law school career your academic focus improved. Would that be fair to say? WJ: That would be fair to say. I didn‟t really feel like I was on much of a mission when I was in undergrad school. I thought this is something I‟ve got to get through to get to where I want to be. I wonder if that sort of attitude maybe has infected a lot of youngsters in high school. But anyhow, I knew when I got to law school, this was where I wanted to be. This was what I wanted to do, and I knew if I was going to be successful I had to work. So I went to work. WB: When I spoke with your daughter, Sandra, she said when you graduated from law school, the first in your class as I understand it, you got your undergraduate degree at the same time? Is that correct? WJ: No. Carolina had a program at that point which said you can go to undergrad for three years, then transfer to law school, and if you completed the first year of law school successfully you would get your diploma for a four year period. So that‟s what actually happened for me. At the end of my first year in law school, I was given my diploma. So now, when I look at the Alumni record at Carolina mine is not AB 1941, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 46 which is what it should of have been, but AB 1942. So, even though I was never in the class of ‟42 in undergrad school, that‟s when I got my diploma on account of that program, that policy. WB: Well, your route was one way of going around having to pass the comprehensive exam, because that‟s—. WJ: Well, that‟s a neat way to phrase it. That‟s right. I never did pass the comprehensive, and I did get my diploma. WB: You were married when you were in law school, is that correct? WJ: I was not married, and that was no fault of my own. I wanted to get married, and Mildred said not until you get your law degree. So, I waited, and I graduated in June from law school, and on June the 17th I was lucky enough to have her say I do. WB: So when would you have been married? When exactly? WJ: That was in 1944. June the 17th. WB: And that was the date of the marriage? WJ: That was the date I got married. I think my graduation date was June the 6th. WB: You told us about your interview with the Charlotte firm Tally—. WJ: Tillett. Tillett and Campbell. WB: Okay, and then your decision not to take that job and go to Richmond and then they gave you the offer you wanted, and it was too late. WJ: Too late. Another one of those fortuitous circumstances for which I have no credit. It just happened. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 47 WB: What was your conversation with Mildred during all of this? What was her position on it and to switch from possible Charlotte then to Richmond then the decision to come back to Lillington? WJ: Well, we did discuss it a lot, trying to discuss it from the stand point of whether she would be happy, how it might affect our relationships with our families because going to Charlotte was, in that day and time, almost like going to another world. I mean, that‟s 150 miles from Lillington. She wanted me to do, bless her heart, what I thought I wanted to do. She said, you make the decision and I‟ll be with you, and she was. WB: By this time had you begun to have children when you came back to Lillington? WJ: Came back to Lillington in January 1, 1945, opened my office. Our first child was born July 1945. That was Sandra. WB: One other thing that I‟ve got in my notes here that we did not—this is also a step back—you mentioned the Boy Scouts? Being active in the Boy Scouts as a child, is that correct? WJ: Yes. There was a biology teacher at Campbell named Gier. He was our scout leader as well as a wonderful troop leader. That proved to be a very beneficial relationship. He taught us a lot of good things. WB: How far did you go in Scouts in terms of—? WJ: Well, I went within one badge of getting my Eagle. I went to a 4-H camp at North Carolina State University, and the one badge I didn‟t have that I needed, was Life Saving. I had the opportunity to do that swimming. There were no swimming facilities Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 48 in Harnett County except the creeks and ponds. On the day I was to go and take that test to see if whether or not I would get that badge, they arranged for us to have a visit to the Governor‟s mansion. I opted to go to the Governors mansion rather than going and doing the swimming test to get my Life Saving badge. So the Governor‟s mansion won out, and I never did fool with trying to go back and get it. So I never got my Eagle badge. WB: You developed a history of one test short. WJ: That‟s exactly right. Well, I failed a lot more tests than that, Walter, but those are two that I can mention. WB: Talk a little bit about setting up a practice and how that went with you. I assume that you started by yourself, is that right? WJ: I did. I started by myself and it was sort of an interesting phenomena to work. I guess it still probably isn‟t unique to Lillington. I had assumed that even though nobody in Lillington knew me, that some of my relatives, of whom there were a lot in this area, would be likely to let me do some work for them. Well, to my disappointment, and I have not yet been able to completely figure it out—well, I think I have some of the answers [as to] why my relatives were the last people who ever came to hire me. I finally decided that they just can‟t see me as anything but a youngun on the farm. They can‟t accept the fact that I‟m now here and would be competent or qualified to handle matters for them. So, it was slow. One of the most pleasant sounds I ever heard was a footstep on a stair coming up to my office back in those early days, because I thought, well, maybe here comes a client. The only difficulty was there were two other lawyers on that same floor and most of those steps were from people going to one of those other offices. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 49 But in time, I did begin to get some business. I was told at Chapel Hill law school, when I was discussing my hopes and what I wanted to do, they said, “Now, it is going to be very slow and very tough, and it will take you at least five years to get to the point that you have a practice that will support you.” They were about right, pretty much on target. WB: They were talking about if you went out—. WJ: As a sole practitioner in a small town. I still have my little ledger I kept that first year, and it‟s somewhat humbling to go back and look at it once in awhile. Also, very mind-boggling to tell you the truth. I hear about lawyers now making three, four, five, six hundred dollars an hour, and six hundred dollars is half as much as I took in the whole year, 1945. I‟ve said many times had it not been for Mildred‟s parents and my parents and their good gardens, I don‟t know if we would have had enough to eat or not. WB: Where did you live then? Actually, what house were you living in? WJ: Well, the first year we were married we moved thirteen times. To Richmond of course, then I came back here lived with my family a couple of weeks, then with her family a couple of weeks, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Then, a fellow who was going off to service had a house with an upstairs apartment in it, we lived in that for a little while. Then, when he went into the service we moved downstairs and about, I guess the fall of „45, we decided we would try to build a house. With the help of our folks we did build a small four room house here in Lillington, moved into that December 19, 1945. I‟m still on the same lot that the house was on. Even when I worked in Raleigh, I still lived in Lillington. I drove back and forth every day. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 50 WB: Let me get, I want to be certain I have all the dates. You were not drafted or served in the military? WJ: No, I was not. WB: Is there a story behind that or—? WJ: Well, maybe so. Maybe it‟s another one of those fortuitous things, Walter. I could not wait to get in the service like a lot others. I think it was a lot of difference in the way people felt at that time and some of the sentiment that we have in this country today. I wanted to get in service, and I tried. I was in my first year of law school, of course, had that newspaper route, which I hated to leave. My first option was the Air Force. I went and applied and took the test, and they said my eyesight was not good enough. I then tried the Navy, but when I went to Raleigh to try to see about getting into the Navy, there was no Navy recruiting station in Raleigh for some strange reason, we were told. A friend of mine, Bruce Elmore, who was a lawyer in Asheville, was in law school the same time I was. We decided we would go to Charleston, South Carolina, to try to get in the Navy. Neither of us had an automobile, and we were going to hitchhike from Chapel Hill to Charleston to enlist in the Navy. We never got to Charleston. We stayed on the road one night and two days, and the furthest we got was Dillon, South Carolina. We finally just gave up on that and turned around and hitchhiked back to Chapel Hill. Then I said, “Well how about the Army?” That was my last choice. Maybe I can make that. I said, “I‟m going to learn about that eye test.” So I memorized the eye chart, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 51 and I went to the recruiting station in Raleigh, took the examination, and they said you‟re okay. So they let me enlist in the Army, sent me to Fort Jackson, South Carolina. After three days at Fort Jackson, one morning they called out my name. “Get in that truck.” I said, “Why am I getting in that truck?” They said, “You‟re going home.” I said, “What‟s the matter?” They said, “You can‟t pass the exam.” I said, “Well, when I took the eye test I asked the fellow if I passed it, and he said, yes, your eyes are good enough for combat. I don‟t understand this. “Well, you‟ve had tuberculosis. You can‟t be accepted.” So they put me in that big truck and took me down to the bus station in Columbia with a ticket to Lillington, and I came home. I‟ve never yet understood that. My mother was terribly distressed, she happened to know Dr. P. P. McCain, who was the McCain‟s sanatorium person. Now they have a correctional center down there. So she sent me down there, and they couldn‟t find anything wrong with me. But I stayed at 4-F the entire war. WB: Before this you did not know you‟d ever had TB? WJ: Dr. McCain said I never had it. Don‟t have it, haven‟t had it. That‟s what he said. And I have wondered to this day whether they got my chart mixed up with somebody else‟s chart. I was humiliated; I was embarrassed; I was upset, really very unhappy about it. But I went on back to law school, caught up my work, and went on from there. WB: I would imagine at Carolina law school during those years the classes were fairly depleted. WJ: Very small, very small. A result was that we got actually the best of an education. We‟d sit down around a table with those professors, ten, twelve, fifteen of us, Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 52 how many there were. You just had one-on-one. So it was really a very wonderful way to get a good law school education as opposed to be being in large classes. One thing you knew you were going to get called on every day. You couldn‟t play the lottery on that. You had to be ready every day. If you were in a large class, you know, you knew not every student in the classroom was going to get questioned. WB: There were no women in law school then? WJ: Yes. There were. There was a young girl from, I think she was from Philadelphia, named Adrian Levy. Then there was young lady named Margaret Faw from Wilmington. No, Margaret was from North Wilkesboro. Those are two I remember. There may have been others, but I don‟t remember any others but those two right now. The rest of us were Caucasian males. WB: When you started getting your practice to start to build, where were your clients coming from? Just word of mouth in the community? WJ: Yes. No advertising. I tried to involve myself in things which were going on in the community, the church, in order to get to know people. That was the only way you had to develop relationships, associations. You had to work very hard at that, or at least I did. Hope that somebody would decide, well, maybe he can at least handle this little item. Much of it to start with was somewhat of an insignificant nature. You wouldn‟t expect some businessman who had a very important legal matter to drop on the desk of somebody just out of law school. So you really, really had to prove yourself, Walter. WB: So when you say insignificant, what sort of cases would they be? Simple criminal cases? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 53 WJ: Criminal cases, not so simple, I don‟t know. I got pretty early involved in a lot of pretty tough criminal matters: murders and rapes and things of that nature. But commercial work, not much of that, some real estate, deeds, a little estate planning, not much. There were almost no child custody battles going on in that time. That‟s a phase of practice that‟s really proliferated. WB: Sandra, your daughter, told me I needed to ask you about your first jury argument. Do you recall? WJ: Oh, come on. Well, the young fellow was charged with what we call a “peeping Tom” statute violation. It‟s still on the books, too. It ought to be I guess. Anyhow, late in the afternoon, came time that I thought they were going to quit and I knew I was going to have to make the first jury argument. I was scared to death, never argued a criminal case to a jury. In fact, I never argued any case to a jury. I looked up at the clock, and it was about quarter till five and I said to myself, well the judge will quit at five o‟clock and I‟ll have until in the morning to get my thoughts together on what I was going to say. “State rests.” “Any further evidence from the defendant?” “No.” “Jury‟s for the defendant, Mr. Johnson.” Then I just almost fell out of my chair. When I got up in front of that jury I didn‟t know what I was going to say, Walter. I didn‟t have the foggiest notion of what to say. I literally could not open my mouth. At about that time the fire alarm went off. I said, “Judge, that may be my house.” WB: [laughs] WJ: About that time somebody popped their head in the door and said the sheriff‟s house was on fire. The sheriff‟s sitting right there in the courtroom, of course. It was, “Bailiff take a recess.” So I was rescued. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 54 WB: [laughs] WJ: And it was the sheriff‟s house, and it did, in fact, burn to the ground. It burned to the ground because the town of Lillington did not have enough water pressure in the lines serving the fire hydrants to force the water to the top of the house through the fire hoses. So, next morning I felt a little better. WB: And made your argument. WJ: And made my argument and unfortunately, not unfortunately but fortunately, the jury said the man wasn‟t guilty. WB: Do you recall how many seconds or moments you stood there before the, you thought—? WJ: It probably must have been five. It seemed like an eon. WB: [laughs] Are there any other memories in particular of your first times in court? WJ: Not really. No. I don‟t have any independent recollections. WB: Did you have any mentors or other lawyers in the community that were a particular help to you? WJ: Yes. WB: Who would they be? WJ: Can we just take about a two minute break and let me get some water? [tape turned off] WB: Talk about your mentors and elders when you started the practice that had helped you. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 55 WJ: Well, there were four whose names I recall that were very helpful to me. All of these were older than myself and had been practicing here in Harnett for a good number of years. One of them was a gentleman named Franklin T. Dupree, Sr.; he practiced in Angier, North Carolina. Had a son who was an attorney in Raleigh, F. T. Dupree, Jr., who later became a Federal judge. Neil Salmon was a very successful criminal lawyer here in Lillington. His brother was a sheriff. Lee Chaffin a former clerk of the Superior Court who did a lot of civil work. And then there was a lawyer in Dunn named Duncan Wilson with whom I had an association for awhile who was a very excellent criminal lawyer. All four of these people were helpful to me if I had a question or problem I didn‟t know how to deal with. I felt entirely welcomed by them to get help, ask questions, and I feel indebted to all four of those people for the assistance they gave me. I‟ve often said I don‟t think I ever had a client come to my office with a problem that I could answer or solve on the basis of anything I learned in law school. That, perhaps, is a bit of an exaggeration, but by and large in a small rural community like Lillington, most of the problems that came to you, initially at least, were not in the nature of those you dealt with in the case studies in law school, Walter. WB: And there was no, at that time when you went, there was no real “skills” training in how to practice or any thing like that. WJ: Never heard of CLE. It was pretty much trial and error, sometimes to the regret of yourself, as well as to the misfortune of your client. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 56 WB: So, when you were trying your earlier cases, you were trying solo, basically. WJ: Some of them. Then later I had association with Mister Wilson. WB: When did that begin? WJ: Think that must have been maybe the early 50‟s, I‟m not sure. I‟ve been practicing a right good while. WB: So by that time you had known him for quite a while. WJ: Oh, yes. I had an experience, Walter, I want to mention out of the hope it will be of value to somebody because the temptations were there, and they‟re still there. But, there was a fellow in this town whose father was Judge on our Recorders Court, it was then—we didn‟t have anything like a District Court. This is something that I have some hesitancy about even addressing, and yet again I think I should. I won‟t call names but anybody who knew anything about what was going on then will know to whom I refer. This was pretty early on in my practice when I spent most of my time waiting and hoping for a client, and this fellow came to me. He was the son-in-law of the Judge of the Recorders Court and told me he wanted to talk to me about something, wanted to discuss the matter of his bringing me business if I would agree to give him half of my fee. There was no appeal to that. You know that was the most blatant kind of proposition anybody could make to you, but even so, I have thought on occasion: well you know, what if—. In my life I guess are, like a lot people, a lot of “what if‟s”. What if I had been stupid enough to succumb to that sort of proposition? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 57 The point I want to make here is for young lawyers particularly, and they‟ll think I‟m an old fogy trying to tell them how to run their ship, but so be it: you have to be so very careful that you don‟t let something that appears on the face of it to have some sort of monetary reward for you to get you into a trap that you will never get out of. Because if I had ever let that fellow give me one client giving him half of the fee, he would have had me under this thumb for the rest of my life; and if there‟s anything a lawyer needs, it‟s his freedom. Freedom to represent his clients like he feels he should, freedom to do what he thinks is right. No matter what. WB: I would imagine at that point some sort of arrangement that would‟ve helped you get more clients and improve your financial situation would have [End of Tape 2, Side A] Tape 2, Side B: WB: Do you recall how you responded to him? WJ: Asked him out of my office. WB: Did that affect your relationship with his father who was the Judge? WJ: Not that I could detect. I would suspect that his father-in-law—. WB: It was his father-in-law? WJ: Yes, that his father-in-law knew nothing about this, and I would suspect also that he would have put a very harsh treatment on his son-in-law for something like that. WB: Are there any other incidents that have occurred to you along those lines which were a particular instance of learning about ethics or how to control your practice and how to keep your independence and so forth? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 58 WJ: Well number one, I think you have to be very careful about who you choose for your associates—and I don‟t mean legal associates—I mean in the community. Number two, I think you have to understand that making a dollar is not the most important thing. Number three, I think you have to acknowledge, sadly, that there are people who will use you to their own benefit without regards of the negative impact on you if you let them do it. There‟s a song about the only friends I have, the only thing I can count on now are my fingers, which makes a pretty good point, you know. You have got to be careful about who you come to rely on. My wife had a great ability to read people. She helped me out a lot in that respect. Alcohol is the bane of our profession, Walter. Drugs are becoming also a factor now, and the statistics on what the two together are doing to the legal profession are just absolutely frightening and depressing. I saw several good men with good minds, good legal skills, destroy themselves with alcohol right here in this county. WB: Was your wife at any time involved with you in the practice or helping in the office? WJ: No, she wasn‟t. We had an understanding about that early on, that she would not be expected to come to the office to help. She used to jokingly say, I couldn‟t stand to be with you twenty-four hours a day. So well, bless her heart, she would have if it had been necessary. She stayed home and looked after the children and did a wonderful job. WB: Are there any particular cases that stand out as learning experiences in your mind other than the one where you balked on your closing argument? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 59 WJ: Well, yes. One. I‟ve had some cases that taught me that the biggest mistake you can make in the courtroom is to take something for granted. I believe very strongly in the jury system. I hope we never abolish it. I believe that in most instances jurors do make the right decision. Often times for reasons that have nothing at all to do with the evidence in the case, but somehow or other they get the right conclusion, I think. But occasionally they do make terrible mistakes. I don‟t know if I mentioned a moment earlier on about the boys who stole the cotton to you? WB: No. I don‟t think so. WJ: Well, this will give you a little insight into how you have to read your client if you‟re doing criminal work. I was representing three boys who were charged with stealing cotton after it had been picked. Evidence was that this farmer‟s cotton pickers loaded up their sheets, tied them up, went home for the night. When they came back to the field the next morning the cotton sheets were gone. Ultimately they got to the three boys and charged them with stealing cotton. That‟s a pretty serious crime in Harnett County in those days. Judge Clawson Williams—who had himself quite a reputation as being a pretty stern judge and former District attorney, prosecuting attorney—was trying the case. Judge Williams was a great Carolina fan and this was in the week of the Duke / Carolina football game. Pretty early on in the case he called me up to the bench one day and said, “Bill, I want you to know something. Duke / Carolina are playing this Saturday, and I‟ve got tickets, and I intend to go that ballgame. I want you to move this case along.” Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 60 Well, we did, I thought as well as we could at moving it, but long about Friday lunch time it became pretty apparent we weren‟t going to finish the case. I go up to the bench, and he points his finger and says, “You‟re going to make me miss this football game and I don‟t want that to happen. You get your clients back in and tell them that if they‟ll plead guilty now they‟ll get a very light sentence, and if they don‟t you‟re to convince them I‟ll give them every day I can.” Now you can make judgment on whether or not that was prejudging by the Judge or not, but in any event that was a fact of life. I talked to my clients, “No sir, we ain‟t going to plead guilty to something we didn‟t do.” We tried the case. About four o‟clock Saturday afternoon the jury came back. “Guilty.” And good as his word he gave them every day the law would present. Deputy Sheriff told me on Monday, “You know what those boys told me? I took them to Central Prison [Saturday] afternoon after the Judge sentenced them. They were sitting in the car with me and laughing and talking about it. And they said, you know, they stole the cotton. They told me they stole that cotton. They just didn‟t want to plead guilty because they thought there was a chance the jury might turn them loose. So sometimes there are people who plead not guilty who are guilty. In fact one of the reasons I gave up practicing [criminal] law, and I don‟t want anybody to misunderstand what I‟m saying here, was because I became persuaded in my own mind that probably ninety-five percent of the people charged with a crime are guilty of something. I acknowledge that there are many—numeric, not percentage-wise—charged with a crime who are not guilty. Happily we have ways and means now of discovering a lot of those cases, which ought to distress everybody to see the number who Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 61 have been sentenced to even death when they were innocent. But I just decided that the role of a lawyer in criminal cases is not to get the client off, but to see that the client is tried by the rules, and then I finally got to the place I didn‟t like to play that game anymore, and I just walked away from it. WB: About when would that have been? WJ: Probably 1960. In fact, after I came back to practicing in ‟67, I guess, I didn‟t do much criminal work after that. WB: When you say you walked away from it is that when you became a judge? WJ: No, I just quit doing criminal work. WB: I see. WJ: Then I went to Raleigh to be Commissioner of Revenue, and then after that I went on the bench, and then when I came back from that I did very little criminal work. WB: Talk a little bit about your public career which is extensive. One thing you said about when you begin practice, was that one of the ways you realized that you had to build up your practice was to become involved in the community to incur some support; but you also were involved in community service and various official capacities weren‟t you? WJ: Yes. Well, that‟s a sort of an apples and oranges sort of thing, I believe Walter, at least for me. Part of doing that, I will confess, was a selfish motivation you know, to help myself become better known in the community and get acquainted with people who I thought might have some need for me sometime in the future. A part of it was because of absolute firm belief that all of us owe something to the community in which we live. One of the things that made me attracted to the legal profession was that Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 62 historically lawyers had, I thought at least, been outstanding in that respect. They were community leaders in many areas. And then, politics was one of the most appealing things in the world to me. I said the two most fun things I ever did in my life I had to give up. One was playing poker, and the other was fooling with politics. I decided I couldn‟t play poker in a town like Lillington where most of the people were members of the Baptist church and Methodist church. I decided I didn‟t want a career in politics, but both of those are absolutely fascinating areas to me. WB: Well, they have some things in common. WJ: They do. Absolutely, absolutely. A lot of things in common. I got involved in politics accidentally. I hadn‟t been here very long. A friend of mine who I did not know too well came to me and said, “Kerr Scott‟s running for Governor, and I want you to manage his campaign in Harnett County.” I said, “I don‟t know anything about politics. That‟d be a disaster.” He said, “Well, we‟ll help you.” I got into it, and I‟ve never done anything in my life that I found any more interesting, and there was a lot of fun in it too. A lot of disappointments. I managed his campaign in Harnett County. He won. I managed Terry Sanford‟s campaign in Harnett county. He won. I managed Richard Preyer‟s campaign in Harnett County. He lost. I managed Dr. Frank Graham‟s campaign in Harnett County, and he lost. That was one of the great disappointments in my political life. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 63 Then I was involved in others to a lesser degree, and there‟s something about politics and the way it works, the way people act and react and interact with each other—it‟s just fascinating to me. Dr. Frank Graham could have won, I think, if he‟d been willing to just do some of the things I think he could have properly done, but he wouldn‟t do it. When he came to Lillington, we had a county rally here in Lillington for him, and I had a crowd of people right up here at the courthouse who had agreed to come and hear him speak and meet him and what not. When he gets out of the car at the stop light at the courthouse corner, there were a lot of white people there and there were African Americans there, and he walks by a half a dozen white people, officials, whatnot or whoever, I don‟t know, and really went out of his way to go over and shake hands with one of the few black people in that crowd. Now that was a wonderful and commendable thing for him to do, and let me hasten to say I shared completely his beliefs about that sort of thing. But I thought that from a political standpoint, you know, he could‟ve done both at the same time. He almost went out of his way to make it difficult on that issue. WB: So he did not shake hands with—-. WJ: He did afterwards. WB: Oh, I see. WJ: Yes. Then of course they put out that despicable photograph which is another issue I won‟t even talk about now. WB: This was the one that Jesse Helms was involved in? WJ: Right. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 64 WB: Someone mentioned that you advised Frank Graham to respond to some of those attacks more vigorously than he did. Was that a frustration in the campaign? WJ: He, he just wouldn‟t do it, and we told him, you know. And we thought he could do it in a way that would be entirely proper, but, he just absolutely wouldn‟t do it. Albert Coates used to say the thing about Frank Graham was he always wanted to die a martyr. I don‟t know if there‟s a word of truth to this or not, but Albert said it. He said he went up somewhere in Virginia, they were having an air show or something and he jumped out of an airplane hoping to get killed. WB: That Frank Graham jumped. WJ: Yes. He wanted to die a martyr. But let me tell you he was a wonderful human being, and some of the happiest times I had in Chapel Hill was to go to his house every Sunday night. He had his house opened for students to come and sit and talk to him, and listen to him, and that was a wonderful experience that, of course, kids don‟t have available today for a lot of reasons. Anyhow, he was a wonderful human being and a wonderful man, a very important figure. WB: So your first contact with him, then, was when you were a student at Carolina? Between then and his run for the Senate, did you have any other relations with him? WJ: Not really. No. WB: I had seen that you had run for some local offices before all this management of campaigns. WJ: I never ran for an office in my life. WB: Is that right? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 65 WJ: That‟s right. WB: Okay. Anything about the Kerr-Sanford campaigns that you recall in specific? Of how they worked or how they��? WJ: Well, Kerr Scott was a tremendous campaigner. Terry was too. Rich [Preyer] was not as good on the campaign trail as either of those fellows. Both of them knew how to read the public sentiment and I‟m not suggesting that either of them abandoned any of their principles or their beliefs in order to make themselves more appealing; but they knew how to address political issues in a way that was receptive to a lot of people without really giving up their principles or abandoning what they really believed in. That takes real skill. I didn‟t know Rich quite that well. I got to know him better much later on and of course, his wonderful wife Emily. Those were some campaigns that were a lot of fun, a lot of disappointment too. WB: The Scott campaign was for Governor. The Sanford campaign was for Governor. WJ: Right. Also I worked for him in his Senatorial race, in both of those. WB: Preyer was for Governor? WJ: He ran against Dan Moore. Dan Moore, right here. I later got to know Governor Moore, and his wife, Jenelle, became one of my very dearest friends, and she was, in my judgment, she was the reason Dan Moore was Governor. WB: This would‟ve all been Democrats running against Democrats at that time. WJ: Right. Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 66 WB: You said you never ran for public office yourself. Was there any particular reason for that? WJ: Well, I guess there were two reasons. And I‟m not going to put these in any particular order or significance. Number one, I was afraid I‟d loose if I ran. I don‟t like to loose. Number two, my wife didn‟t feel I ought to get mixed up in politics to that extent, and I had a lot of respect for her judgment. Number three, I didn‟t ever find myself in a position that I really could afford it in the terms of time and money. In those days of course, the cost in time and money was nothing like what it is today. Regrettably, we have about priced public office out of the reach of most people. WB: When you were involved in these campaigns what would your activities be and how—? You talked about arranging the meeting for Dr. Graham at the town [square] in Lillington, but what other things would you do? Would you actually caucus where the candidate—? WJ: Well, it‟s so much unlike what is today. No TV to speak of. There was certainly none in the early Scott-Sanford. We did it by what we called precinct organization. We would set up a committee at each precinct. This would be a group of people who we thought were respected in the precinct, who had some influence with the other people, the voters in the precinct. And of course, you had to find people who were supportive of your candidate, but who were willing to get out and, as we called it in those days Walter, beat the bushes for votes, which involved going house to house, having rallies at the courthouse or even in the churches. Barbeques were big in that day and time. One of the prettiest sights I have ever seen in my life was right here in Lillington at the baseball field up at the high school. We Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 67 had a barbeque for Kerr Scott, and we had people who gave a hundred hogs. We dug a trench all the way across that baseball field, got farmers, people, to bring in wood by the truckload. We built a fire in that trench, we had wire stretched over the fire when it got to be a bed of coals, and then we had a hundred hogs split down the middle lying on that rack to be barbequed. I‟ve never seen anything like it before or since. The aroma in the air was pretty good too. And we had men who and ladies too, who knew when the pork was done and we cooked these things overnight now, you know. We were right beside the park with an old tin school building, gymnasium it was really. Then we took these into that gym, and we had people in there who cut up and chopped and seasoned this barbeque right there, and then we fed everybody who came. We had lots of pork, we had lots of barbeque, and we had lots of people. Then, another very important element was getting what we called “haulers”— WB: H-a-u-l-e-r-s. WJ: H-a-u-l-e-r-s. These were people we would get somebody who A, you thought was reliable, and B, who had some influence in the area. You would give this person X dollars and in return that person would agree that on Election Day he, sometimes a lady but mostly men, would go and pick up certain people and bring them to the polls to vote because, believe it or not, in those days there were still a lot of people who did not have automobiles, had no means of transportation. At meetings before Election Day we would say, “Ok, John Doe, your responsibility is to go get Mrs. So-and-so,” and he‟d have a list of the people he was to pick up and bring to the voting place and take back home. He would also have a list as to how we wanted this person to vote. A lot of times [the hauler would] go to the voting booth with that person to be sure that they Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 68 did vote that way. I don‟t know how that sounds in this modern era, but that is the way it was. Well, every once in a while you would find out on the next day after the election that hauler A, who you had paid, actually carried people to vote for your candidate‟s opponent, a little bit of that—. WB: And you know that they were being paid by them as well. WJ: That‟s right. Then, there were some communities, I can think immediately of two in Harnett county, you didn‟t have to have any meetings, you didn‟t hire any haulers. You had to go see “John Smith” and you gave John Smith X dollars, and that was it. John Smith would, in a very literal sense of the word, deliver the votes in that community or that precinct. Happily that isn‟t true anymore, but it was very true in that day and time. Money was a tremendous factor even in those days. Not the kind of money we have in today‟s campaigns, but the person who had [the most] money [had a big advantage]. I know the fellow who managed the campaign for Charlie Johnson, who was Kerr Scott‟s opponent and was the old so-called “Democratic machine” candidate, told me one day—I think he was trying to insult me or intimidate me—about how much money he had that he was going to spend in this county on behalf of Charlie Johnson, and of course, his numbers just blew my mind compared to what we had. We didn‟t have a lot of money. In fact, I never had a candidate that had plenty of money to spend, but it was a real game, I‟m telling you. WB: And were you also responsible for raising any of the money? Or did that come from—? Interview number C-0341 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. William A. Johnson 69 WJ: No, in fact headquarters would give you an assignment. Now you‟ve got to raise X dollars in your county. We can provide Y dollars, but you‟ve got to have more than Y dollars, so you‟ve got to raise these many dollars in your own county. Of course, we would solicit people. We would find businesses which were willing to pay for ads in papers or on the radio, and sometimes a group of women would even have fundraisers. I know one time an aunt of mine who was also a Democrat in Onslow County [working for Dr. Graham], said one of the things they did her county was have a sale of graham crackers in order to raise money for the Frank Graham campaign. WB: [laughs] WJ: And so you had to pick and choose where you might find your resources and who you could get to help. There was always somebody out there who made it clear, passively if not otherwise, that you understand that if X wins then so-and-so and so-and-so. Of course, that‟s something that at my level, a county manager, never makes any commitments of any sort on anything like that. I think I knew enough about how the system operated at that time, and may even operate in this day and time, that there were understan</dc:description>

<dc:description>&#x27;I&#x27;m in the home.of Harold Makepeace in Sanford, NC. This is August:
6, 1982.- I Have known Harold now for a number of years and we will
be discussing Everett Jordan and Luther Hodges.
Ben Bulla: Harold, If you will please, tell me when and where you met
Everett Jordain. •&quot;.■•;-
HM: I met Everett Jordan in 1952--that was when he had the restaurant-in
Danville and they had&quot; orre a^ Durham called Jorges, Inc,, on Hwy. 15
and 501 between Durham and Chapel Hill. That&#x27;s when I first met BEJ.
Everett went fnT with&#x27; tXithex and anothVr\g1*y&gt; ait Danville in that restau-
■&#x27;■&quot;■&#x27;;■■ . :&#x27; ■ ■.&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; &quot;...-&#x27;.,&quot; ■ &#x27;-y &#x27;\ %* ■ . &#x27; &#x27;&quot;■■&#x27; , i&#x27;-&#x27;&#x27; V :&#x27;&#x27;•? ■&#x27;&#x27;&quot;&#x27;... &#x27;■*&quot; &#x27;■&#x27; ■,■&quot; ■ &#x27; ■
rant business up there. Then as things progressed they got involved
in one or two more Howard Johnson&#x27;s. They had one on 301 and one on
87; Bragg Boulevard.
BB: Were you involved in any more?
HM: No, those three and then Clarence^and myself rented the one from
ie«£a Jones (?) over in Raleigh.. .renting from the Jordans when this
happened over in Raleigh...we tried to buy the one in Chapel Hill a
number of times but they didn&#x27;t show any interest in selling it.
BB: The one in Chapel Hill was prosperous wasn&#x27;t it?
HM: Yes. The most prosperous one was on 301. Tom Pearsail bought it.
Then when Luther Hodges was running for Lt. Gov. I didn&#x27;t know Everett
too well. I was.. Luther&#x27;s so called campaign manager—he knew hardly
Hf titles :~j\e&#x27;1&#x27;i&quot;r* l%&lt;&lt;- J?f7AA^ /ITf£f&gt; Mire** «- ^.^ .
anyone in political life_jLn_MG /. . .&#x27;..&#x27;/.. .&gt;and that was our base-Tfffc*&quot;
ftttd getting him elected as Lt. Gov and meeting with Everett in the
business of the restaurants we discussed a lot of politics. Everett,
back then, I think, wanted to be governor of NC--I don&#x27;t think there
is any doubt.because he would say something to me about Luther progressing
so fast. He would say that, &quot;Luther hasn&#x27;t come up through the ranks&quot;
like they did back then-.-Cherry and Umstead and Broughton; Gardner--you
knew a number of years before who the next governor was going to be.
BB: The party promoted them through the ranks to be governor?

HM:/ In&#x27;fact, you could almost know there for a while who was going
to-be the next governor. . i\vxf ■ brother served three terms in the
State Senate and two in the House.„ And Everett would talk to me
knowing I Was going to tell Luther; and Luther would do the same
thing; knowing that I was going to tell--I was the go-between a lot
of times the^e;^ what ea,ch one- was thinking. As t; said Everett said, ^
&quot;Luther is just going too fast; he ought, to come up through the ranks.&quot;
I know one Wine vre -Went oveir to/the, S^tate Democratic Meeting over at
the Sir Walter when he- was&#x27; running for ,Lt. dbvv I can just see us now;
Luther and I standing in that lobby.r.-why you would have thought Hodges
was a bastard at a family reunion almost—they just weren*t having
anything to do with Luther Hodges because Roy Rowe was running and he
had been Senator—Senate pro tern, «*e.--he was working his way up you

know and was running for It, Gov. Everybody was for him. He was from
a little town--Wa/saw? or something. He was a real strong politician--
and he could have called for a runoff but hii didn&#x27;t. ; They put Luther
in as Lt. Gov, Then after the death of Gov. Umstead he filled out his
unexpired term of two years and then ran on his own.
BB: You were his.campaign manager when he ran for Lt. Gov. and Gov.?
HM: This was his headquarters here in Sanfprd. He would come down and
we would work out from here. I&#x27;d use &quot;my car one day and then he&#x27;d use
his. He paid his expenses and I&#x27;d pay mine. One time he and Everett
spent the night here. My favorite breakfast back in my.young days was
fried chicken, gravy, sweet potatoes and hot biscuits, etc., so J told

appointing Everett Jordan as United States Senator I was on a trip out
West where*had sent me ! ./&gt;. . vi P. t { . t. . . and he told me about 8:30 that
morning. He said, &quot;I havn&#x27;t slept all night. In business, in politics—
I have^ never been under such pressure. Jordan U S Senator.&quot;
He said they really gave him f its 63-),. .&quot;&quot;. . .he was a good state senator, and
he was real active with Everett Jordan in the Democratic Party and so
when Luther appointed kirn Senator he just gave me hell (Ben to whom is
he referring?).... .couldn&#x27;t understand why Luther Hodges would appoint
Everett Jordan to the Senate now the older group, as I could see,
were all in favor of it; it was the younger Democrats wanted Terry
Sanford or who. Anyway, they soon got over it.
BB: According to the press Hodges appointed Jordan for a temporary thing;
as a seat warmer—that he, himself, wanted that seat later on.
HM: I tried my best to get him to appoint Ben Trotter, and just make
a statement that, &quot;I am appointing Ben Trotter to fill out the unexpired
term of Senator Scott and my intentions are to run for U S Senate when
my term expires as Governor.&quot; He wouldn&#x27;t agree to it—I thought that
eventually he was going to run for the Senate but then Kennedy appointed
him Commerce SEcretary you know.
BB: Harold, when Hodges appointed Jordan to the Senate do you think
they discussed that Hodges wanted to run for that seat in a couple year&#x27;s
time maybe?
HM: I don&#x27;t think so. No siree&#x27;!
BB: No deal then? The press thought there was.
HM: It was never indicated--! never felt or anything-^(he logical per&gt;&lt;
would have&#x27; Ben Trotter she died first. But he was the
most logical. I understand now why--I think I know why. I didn&#x27;t find
out until he was Secretary of Commerce. We went on a trip up to

[Tape #2 - new battery]
BB: Harold will you repeat our earlier conversation. If you would
just briefly tell me how you met Everett Jordan.
HM: I met Senator Jordan around 1952. Luther Hodges was a candidate
for Lt. Gov. Hodges, Jordan and myself were in the reataurant business.
BB: These restaurants were in Chapel Hill.and also
HM: We leased the one from them in Chapel Hill and we built the large
one down on 301 outside of Fayetteville. Gov. Hodges, Senator Jordan
and myself.
BB: When did you first meet Hodges?
HM: My daddy was cabin roommate in 1928 when he went to Europe to
a Rotary convention and I have been knowing him ever since. We became
more active after he retired from Fieldcrest because he lived in New
York and Chicago and other places when he was with them. After he
retired from Marshall-Field he called me one night and said, &quot;What do
you think about me running for Lt. Gov.&quot; I said, &quot;You want to start
in the morning?&quot; He laughed of course--he got some more friends; mainly
Rotarians and business associates because he had never been real active
in statewide politics. I think he was on the highway commission way back
years ago and it wasn&#x27;t as important then as it is now. We started a
campaign and got a few for a long time he wouldn&#x27;t even have a
card to present a person. We talked him into getting a few of those--
then he was bashful at first to give the card out--we&#x27;d give the card
out and he just^wasn&#x27;t used to that kind of operation. All the politic
ians said it would be almost impossible to defeat Roy Rowe that had
been in the Legislature--a Senator for numbers of terms.
BB: Where was Roy from?

HM: Some little town down here in Sampson Countyv-in that area there.
BB: What had he done before he ran against Hodges?
HM: He was a lawyer--been active in the Democratic Party--close friend
of Everett Jordan.
BB: He was a professional politician then?
HM: Yeah. We started the state campaign for Lt. Gov. and the Rotary
friends, etc. From there built up a right good organization. When we
went in to get the real politician&#x27;s support they said that they were
sorry, but they were for Rowe. But at the end Hodges was high man out
of the three--I forget who the other candidate was. Mr. Rowe could
have called for a second primary but he was advised not to. In fact
Lynn Nesbitt the newspaper writer from Raleigh called me during that
timev-he supported Rowe but he had advised him not to call for a second
primary because he did not think he could defeat Hodges. Later on,
after intergration came up, Rowe told the Governor that he was thankful
that he had been elected instead of himself; that he had done a grand
job in handling that proposition and he didn&#x27;t think that he, himself,
could have done it. That developed into the Governor and Jordan becoming
closer friends politically, etc.
BB: Everett Jordan supported Hodges in the Governor&#x27;s race but I&#x27;m
wondering when and where Jordan met Hodges?
HM: I can&#x27;t tell you right off the bat that Everett supported Luther
in the Lt. Gov. race. I really don&#x27;t recall.
BB: Did he know Hodges then?
HM: Yes.
BB: Jordan was also active in the Rotary, it could be that he met
Hodges in the Rotary.
HM: Well I don&#x27;t think Everett was that active I don&#x27;t know how

the tie-in started with Hodges and Jordan in the Howard Johnson&#x27;s
business. Luther was in with one of the Vice Presidents or one of
the workers of the mill up there [in Danville] I forget the fellow&#x27;s
name--they were real close friends--I guess they invited Everett to
join them in Danville. Then they got the franchise for Chapel Hill.
Hodges sold out then and we two built the one down on Bragg Blvd. and
the one on 301 in Fayetteville.
BB: And you leased one over in Raleigh?
CJ5. ,, „ , ,
HM: Clarence Daniels and I did- -from -Getia Jones.
BB: Did you have any part in that one in Greensboro?
HM: No that was Luther and Jones in Raleigh.
BB: I think so. Jordan was not involved in the one in Greensboro.
HM: Then Luther, Jr. and Jones built the one over here outside
of Durham on Interstate 85t-north of Durham. I reckon they still own
BB: Is Jones still living?
HM: Yeah, he&#x27;s a multi-millionaire now, lives in Raleigh--small contractor;
Davison and Jones just hit everything at the right time
BB: Did the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant have a big part in it?
HM: No. That was mine. That HJ he owned out there north of Raleigh
that never was a big--in fact we gave it up after a year or two. There
wasn&#x27;t that much tourist trade on No. 1.
BB: You were Hodges campaign manager when he ran for Governor?
HM: Yes.
BB: When he ran for Lt. Gov. too?
HM: Well we didn&#x27;t designate anyone back then; we just all worked
together. He and myself traveled all over the state together. He
financed his own program as Lt. Gov. I paid my own expenses and fed

him when he was here.
BB: But you were unofficially his campaign manager?
HM: Yeah. Didn&#x27;t have any titles back then--he was new at politics--
that was my first state-wide campaign.
BB: What did you do as campaign manager?
HM: Went all over the state with him--back and forth from one end to
the other a number of times.
BB: Did you make speeches for him?
HM: No. Mainly he was meeting the people. The Rotarians throughout
the state were a big help to him in the race for Lt. Gov. That was our
base to get started.
BB: You knew the people across the state through Rotary?
HM: I knew them through Scouting too. I was president of Ocaneechee
Council for two years along that time and he had been active in Boy
Scouting also. The manufacturing friends that Hodges knew came to his
aid, but the real politicians in the Lt. Gov. race were not supportive
of Hodges.
BB: Do you mind telling me why?
HM: Well back then you came up through the ranks to become Lt. Gov.,
Governor—way back there you knew about two terms ahead who was going to
be next. I delivered messages between Everett and Luther Hodges, and
I think that they knew that I was carrying it back and forth, because
they were feeling each other out--Everett came up through the Democratic
party as a hard worker and he thought that was what everyone else should
do to reach the higher post such as Senator and Governor and I personally
think that he wanted to be Governor of North Carolina. In fact he told
me one time, &quot;Luther hadn&#x27;t come up through the ranks--he&#x27;s traveling
too fast.&quot; In a good natured way, he wasn&#x27;t vicious about it or anything,

The morning that he appointed Everett to the Senate he called me, he
had sent me out west on some business, I forget what, he got -hold of
me about 8:30 that morning and said, &quot;Harold I havn&#x27;t slept a wink all
night,. In business and politics that I have been in; I have never been
pressured as much in my life as I have in the last few weeks. I&#x27;ve
made a decision and I&#x27;m going to announce at 11:00 o&#x27;clock that I&#x27;m
fill
appointing B. Everett Jordan of Saxapahaw to/the unexpired term of
Senator Scott.&quot; I was hoping that the Governor was interested in going
to the Senate himself. Why didn&#x27;t he appoint someone that was a close
friend and legal attorney like Ben Trotter to keep the seat warm until
his term expired as Governor, then he could run. But he was not interested
I wasn&#x27;t the only one that tried to get him to do it.
BB: You did not think that Everett Jordan would be a seat warmer for him?
HM: I don&#x27;t think so. I don&#x27;t think so.
BB: Hodges never mentioned that to you?
HM: Never &quot;was, but he refused to put Ben Trotter as a seat warmer.
[This is the end of side one tape #2]
Ben Trotter..
BB: He wasn&#x27;t obligated
anyone--
HM: The Democratic Party, as such, that he could appoint most anyone
that he wanted to. I, as well as sone of his other friends, tried to
;et him to appoint Ben Trotter before Everett ever entered into the
thing.
BB: Was Ben Trotter agreeable?
.i
HM: I don&#x27;t know whether Ben ever knew it or_not, I found out later
why he wasn&#x27;t appointed--not only that, but to a state jo*b in Raleigh.

HM: Well when the ABC chairmanship became vacant there was a lot of
interest in Ben Trotter being appointed to that chairmanship. He had
had problems in that area, personally, and just wasn&#x27;t suitable to be
on that particular committee.
The first time I knew he had a drinking problem was when we went
to Washington and were on Kennedy&#x27;s private yacht, Sequoia. We had
dinner on it and went down to Mount Vernon, etc. And when we got back
to Washington to get off we missed Ben. Of course we had all had cocktails
and so onr-the Governor asked me to go back to get him. So I went back
and went down in the galley and there he was. He was having a big time
down there with the Puerto Rican chefs [laughs]. We got off and
and Ed Rankin, Ben Trotter and myself tried to get a train back home--
were unable to and finally took a bus and rode all night. When we got
to Raleigh Ben was still having a little problem. He was just one of
those people that couldn&#x27;t take a drink and control himself. A lot
are that way. But he was a great friend of Luther Hodges--in fact he
was the treasurer of the campaign.
BB: He raised money for Luther Hodges?
HM: Well he was head of it. We had different ones like Hugh Morton,
Gordon Gilmore and bthers--Al Les&#x27;h-&gt; others were raising the money. Ben,
like the Governor wasn&#x27;t in the inner circle of the political party like
Everett Jordan was. Hodges wouldn&#x27;t let me tell him or let Trotter
tell him--or he wouldn&#x27;t look at the treasurer&#x27;s book--who had donated--
how much or anything and a $1,000 was the most we would accept from
any one person, I turned back a lot of checks for $5,000 or more.
BB: That was so Hodges wouldn&#x27;t be obligated to any one person?
HM: That&#x27;s what he said, &quot;He just didn&#x27;t want to be obligated to
anyone.&quot; It was a new day for him as far as that goes. When I was

appointed as his campaign--state manager--I couldn&#x27;t mess around the
Governor&#x27;s offica a&#x27;tall. He was still the Governor of N C and he
was attending to the duties. Fact is, he did more campaigning in the
Lt. Gov. race than he did in the Governor&#x27;s race. He hardly needed a
manager--£or we refunded 25% to each person that donated, after
campaigning was over and all expenses were paid. Which that was the
first time that was ever done and it was such a nice thing to do that
the News and Observer didn&#x27;t put much of it in the paper.
BB: Has anyone ever done that since then?
HM: I think it&#x27;s been done once or twice in some&#x27;race--I don&#x27;t know
whether it was the Governor&#x27;s race or not.
We were at the at the Sir Walter Hotel that night--had
a few cocktails. There were some friends from the western part of
the state and Everett Jordan--and brought him a paper bag full of
home-made sausage that Everett was so fond of. We started down in the
elevator--we stopped to pick up a passenger--it was tiny little old
lady. When she got in the elevator--she figured we had had a cocktail
or two and she had her eye on this paper bag--just staring at it.
Everett noticed it and he just dropped it right in the middle of the
elevator car--and said, &quot;Lady, that&#x27;s not what you thought it was.&quot;
Then she kind of broke a smile--it was funny--I can see him dropping
that sack now, and it hit--flooosh!
BB: When Hodges appointed Jordan to the Senate some folks have said
that Hodges wanted to get John Larkin out as chairman of the Democratic
Party. So one of the conditions of the appointment was that Jordan
help him get Larkin replaced.
HM: I know that John and the Governor didn&#x27;t hit it off a hundred
percent together. Their thinking was a little bit diffrent, politically

Harold Makepeace -12-
That&#x27;s just kind of hard to believe. I don&#x27;t see how he would have to
make that sort of appointment--being Governor--to get rid of John
Larkin as Democrat chairman. The Governor never said anything to me
about it--I knew that they did not gee-haw or get along as close friends.
BB: Did you ever have any contact with John Larkin?
HM: Yes I was with him at two Democratic conventions. One in Chicago
and in California. He was a very likeable person; you could not help
from liking the guy.
BB: Was it sort of a personality clash?
HM: I think that was it. And John was more acclimated politically
than the Governor. It&#x27;s like I told you about meeting Jonathan Daniels
in the hall of the Sir Walter Hotel shortly after Hodges was elected
Governor and Mr. Daniels told the Governor, &quot;Well politics makes a lot
of strange bedfellows,&quot; Luther&#x27;s reply was, &quot;Well I don&#x27;t have to sleep
with them&#x27;.&#x27; and walked off.
BB: He didn&#x27;t want to sleep with John Larkin either, did he?
HM: No, he didn&#x27;t want to sleep with John Larkin either. John is a
real likeable fellow. Typical, nice, good eastern boy--loved politics.
He and Thad Eure came from the same area down there. You know I&#x27;m
afraid that Thad Eure is going to keep on running until somebody comes
along and beats him and it&#x27;s a shame. He ought to quit while he&#x27;s ahead,
BB: It would kill his spirit if that happens.
HM: He wouldn&#x27;t live two months, probably, after,
BB: This hurt Everett Jordan very much when he lost.
HM: Its bound to have.
BB: Would you analyze for me why you think Jordan lost?
HM: Well I think the illness and his age--he had made a good Senator--
he and Ervin made a good pair; working together--but here&#x27;s the time

when the youth came along running against a man for a six /ear term--
running a man with some age and illness and the strikes were just
against him. I could feel it and 1 think most of them could feel it.
Somebody probably didn&#x27;t tell Everett all he should have known.
BB: Did you and Hodges both tell him?
HM: I don&#x27;t know whether Luther--I feel that he did.
BB: Did you tell him?
HM; I told him--I told him that I thought it would be a losing deal
for the simple reason of his health and age was against him.
BB: What did he say?
HM: I don&#x27;t remember.
BB; Were you in Washington or Saxapahaw or where?
HM: I can&#x27;t tell you that. It might have been here or it might have
been on the road or something. I t--I&#x27;d certainly support him and
help him in every way I could possibly do and I was sure that Hodges
would do the same thing but--
BB; Did you ever confer with Jordan on any political matters?
HM: No. I never had any--other than I might call him or write him
to tell him that somebody from Sa.hford was coming up and to please--
we would appreciate any favors or considerations7-
BB; How would you describe the relationship between Hodges and Jordan?
HM: ■ I thought they were always friendly or they wouldn&#x27;t have asked
Everett to start in business up there in Danville.
BB: Politicians had to-&quot;-.-&#x27; ;
HM; Different politic--Everett was a seasoned politician and Luther
Hodges wasn&#x27;t. Luther Hodges wasn&#x27;t the mixer that Everett Jordan--
Everett Jordan would keep you laughing the whole time you were with

keeping it. There was more &quot;ruckus&quot; over that than when Everett
was
BB: Folks who criticized the appointment of Everett Jordan were
the young folks in the Democratic Party.
HM: I think it was the younger element--there was one high up in
the Democratic Party that held some of the high positions were really
upset at his appointing Everett Jordan to the United States Senate.
BB: Did he say why?
HM: Just the general purpose that a---
BB: Didn&#x27;t think he was qualified?
HM: Didn&#x27;t think he was qualified in the first place and that was
when the young people were getting more interested--Terry Sanford was
elected young as the Governor,which was unheard of--almost.... Bob Scott
taking over... thought...younger people should be appointed.
I told you about kidding Bill the other day about it. After you called
me I said, &quot;By the way, Ben Bulla was so close to Everett Jordan--that
you fussed so much about--was going to be down...tell him why you was
so opposed to him.&quot; He said, &quot;Just let by-gones be by-gones.&quot;
BB: Bill who?
HM: Staton. He had served ten years in the state senate--made a good
representative—stayed out for about four terms and ran again--didn&#x27;t
beat the man in Raleigh.
BB: folks who were eligible to be appointed to the Senate when
Jordan was. You mentioned Ben Trotter and also a man named Goraid
Saunders that might be considered for that post. Why would Hodges
consider Bill Saunders?
HM: I don&#x27;t know that he was one of them. He could have been a
possibility because they were long time friends and associated in the

same type of business — textile business. I forget the company he
represented--that was down in Aberdeen--big mill, been operating
ever since. Enormous plant--one of the biggest mills in Moore County
I&#x27;d say. They have a big outlet store and everything.
BB: Would Bill Saunders have been receptive to the idea; do you think?
HM: I believe he would. That&#x27;s quite an honor just to get to be
Senator you know.
BB: We were discussing earlier about Hodges ambition to become Vice-
President under the Kennedy administration--did you ever hear Hodges
discuss that?
HM: No. Out in California Lloyd Gilmore and Hugh Morton and some of
us thought that wrangling was going on out there with Lyndon Johnson
and Governor Brown and different ones in fact we had a few
placards where would start marching inside the convention hall--thing
looked like it was gonna turn--in fact we contacted a few of the
delegation and got a good response.
BB: For Hodges for Vice-President?
HM: Yeah. GotTa good response--particularly from some of the western
states.
BB: That was 1960 wasn&#x27;t it?
BB:Later on you said that Hodges went to Washington in the Cabinet
with Kennedy and that he never did have much success in getting a
private meeting with the President—that he always had his son in
HM: ......it never was as serious a meeting as Hodges would have
preferred. In other words if he had something that he wanted to take
up with the President he would certainly want it seriously considered.

BB: Knowing Hodges, that must have irked him.
really
HM: Yeah it irked him. Luther told me one time that he never/had
a sit-down discussion with the President as he thought it should be.
just didn&#x27;t—wasn&#x27;t interested in that particular phase of his
problem. I know one time President Kenndey asked him to represent
him down in Mexico.for three days--which he did--but he, just for
curiosity, had Mitchell Havinger, his secretary to call the airport
to see how much it would cost to send him down there for three days
in this plane. As I remember it was around $25,000 and instead of
using it he goes commercial. I said, &quot;Well you&#x27;re just a
if you had a bunch of people up there that would go in with you on
this kind of savings well and good, but you are just one little man
up there and would be about the only politician that would even think
about that.
BB: Hodges was a good business man--he knew the value of a dollar.
HM: Heck yeah. I went up there and stayed with him about a month
when he first went up there.to help him get his office force and so
on and I saw right off--he had a secretary that had been
secretary to the other Commerce Department head--I saw that she
wouldn&#x27;t last two weeks under Luther Hodges; and I told her so. I
said, &quot;If you stay with him six months, you&#x27;ll love the guy. The
first few weeks you&#x27;re going to hate him--he ain&#x27;t going to put up
with stuff that I see going on up here now, I don&#x27;t give a dern who
it is.&quot; I went back up there a month or two later and I said, &quot;Where&#x27;s
Mrs. Miller?&quot; He said,&quot;I tell you what I had to do to get her out of
the office. I had to give her an office; had to give her a title; had
to give her a secretary.&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; He said,
&quot;Alright you know both of them--go to office so-and-so and you&#x27;ll find

them.&quot; I went around there and there they were....a blame thing.
BB: Why didn&#x27;t he just fire her?
HM: Civil Service! Civil Service the autocrats--the bureaucrats--
chauffeur had one of the prettiest mahogany paneled offices
that you&#x27;ve ever seen. He used a private elevator that Kennedy used
to I think maybe 18 or 20 thousand working in that big building.
By the time they all get there and get settled in the office--it&#x27;s
coffee break. You can&#x27;t even walk in the halls....I told the Governor
if
then that/everybody can see what&#x27;s going on in just this one building
there&#x27;d be a revolution tomorrow.
BB: This was the Secretary of Commerce office building?
HM: Yeah. Well I went down to office, he was in the
weight division--sold scales and all--married to Rachel , Hodges
secretary....appointed in the department. I walked in and he
was as mad as anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen. I said, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter P. G.?&quot;
He said, &quot;Well you know, here at lunch these secretaries and all go
out to these restaurants and have two or three cocktails and they come
back--two of them came back today and one of them picked up an ink
bottle and threw it at the other one. I wanted to fire them.&quot; I said,
&quot;Well why don&#x27;t you?&quot; He says, &quot;Well I&#x27;ve got to prove that she
intended to murder or kill the girl that she threw the ink bottle at.&quot;
He finally didn&#x27;t stay on--he couldn&#x27;t take it. I remember one day
during the inauguration this black chauffeur--Luther Jr. wanted to
do something, I forget what--boy he told him off right quick! Says,
&quot;He don&#x27;t tell me what to do.&quot; Damn black n-chauffeur. Of course he
had a secretary in his office--black chauffeur.
BB: Why does a chauffeur need a secretary?

HM: That&#x27;s what I want to know, [laughs] I&#x27;m sorry, and I always
will regret it that I didn&#x27;t go up there and stay a year just to
really see. However we went on the yacht, and it&#x27;s a beautiful ship.
You get on down in the basin somewhere near a big bridge. We got on
board--didn&#x27;t see an American--Captain of the ship; waiter, porter
or whatever--all Puerto Ricans. Softest job down there or up there--
be on a private yacht for somebody to use....few cocktails or something.
And in the boat basin there are a lot of private yachts--people
spending a week--a few days sightseeing, etc. and as we went out the
ship hit the bridge and tore off a piece of the metal--well you never
heard such booing in your life as the people sitting out there on
those boats--sitting on the deck having a drink. So when we got back
that night we came in all right--from the dock you never heard such
applause in your life. Got back through without hitting the cement
abutment. [laughs] All Puerto Ricans!
BB: You&#x27;d think that on the President&#x27;s yacht they would have the
very top, qualified people.
HM: Why certainly! We were out on the Potomac there--there came on
the loud speaker that the President of the United States was approaching
A much smaller boat. All of us, of course, went on deck--Kennedy--
just a regular size little old open board motor boat but he had secret
service men all around him you know--other boats. He waved--of course
they gave the signal back to him promised Luther....
&gt;: I wonder how Hodges and Kennedy got along as politicians working
together? Different styles; different philosophy.
HM: Well--two people--just completely different--mode of living and
everything else,
uxj: Why did Kennedy appoint Hodges; because of his ability or because

Harold Makepeace -20-
of his political influence.
HM: His ability. See he went on speaking tours for Kennedy and
Johnson. Johnson was running for President--no they ran together--
&gt; . • . i* w ■; &#x27;■ ■
Kennedy ran for President and Johnson for Vice President. Hodges
made these speeches all over the state. I went with him some down
in Texas. The first one he made was down in Atlanta at club.
The next night we were going to be in Dallas . After the speech
was over this doctor came up and introduced his staff--and I met him--
and he said, &quot;I want you to call this doctor friend of mine in Dallas,
I understand that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going to speak tomorrow night--
invite him to the meeting if you will--he&#x27;s a good Democrat.&quot; I said
sure and he gave me his name. When we got down there and got a room,
one of the first things I did was to call this guy.and invite him to
come hear Hodges speech for Kennedy and Johnson. He said, &quot; I don&#x27;t
want to give any short answer Makepeace, but I wouldn&#x27;t walk out my
front door th hear anybody talk about that crooked son-of-a-bitch,
Lyndon Johnson. That thing tickled me to death. We heard some bad
things on Lyndon Johnson out in Texas.
BB: A lot said he was a crook.
HM: Crooked as a snake. You appoint a school teacher to the United
States Senate and he becomes a multi-millionaire--that just don&#x27;t
happen. That guy just wasn&#x27;t about to listen to Hodges stumping for
him--he couldn&#x27;t stomach that!
BB: You told me earlier about a speech Hodges made to the business
men in Washington for the president--would you repeat that please.
HM: I forget the exact problem they were having but being a former
Vice-President of Marshall-Fields he knew all these big boys in
business throughout the U S and Europe as well. They wanted &quot;big

Harold Makepeace
business&quot; to be chastised a little bit and that was his duty to do
which was very unpopular. I heard later that some of the business
people just couldn&#x27;t believe that Hodges would stand up there and
do such a thing.
BB: Chastise for what--wage scales? x
HM: No--I don&#x27;t know .. ,. iprob/.£/yi.with big management back then...
attitude back then almost like it is now--this Carolina Power and Light
Company—that kind of feeling--big business monopolizing everything,
etc I don&#x27;t think the Governor was ever as influential after that.
I don&#x27;t think he ever recovered from it.
BB: How long did he serve as Secretary of Commerce?
HM: Four. He finished with Johnson the term of Kennedy.
BB: Could he have stayed on longer if he had wanted to?
HM: I think he could. I believe Johnson would have reappointed him.
BB: He had had enough of it.
HM: He had enough. He figured before he left to take that job how
much it would cost him. He figured it would cost him, out of his
pockets in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 thousand dollars a year.
BB: What kind of salary did the position pay?
HM; That I don&#x27;t remember. Of course I sure it&#x27;s more now. He had
a car and a chauffeur—uh--the biggest character that I met up there
in Washington was old Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House. This time
we were down in Dallas he was there at the hotel--suite of rooms--he
had a man--smart--as his secretary you know. He was getting ready to
have the press to come up. The secretary--the man--fixing all of the
chairs and he had a desk there. I asked if it would be all right if
I stayed and listened and he said &quot;sure.&quot; So I was looking forward
to hearing the exchange back and forth you know--these little old
Interview number C-0175 in the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection,

Harold Makepeace -22-
piss-tail boys coming in with their hats in their hands like servants--
you know coming to a great guy like Sam Rayburn. Old Sam welcomed them
and told them how much he appreciated their coming--told them what
he wanted to say and when he got through he says, &quot;Boys I really
appreciate your coming,&quot; then he went on back to his room. They
didn&#x27;t get any chance to ask any questions. He said what he wanted to
say then gets up. Hodges can do some of that--he could get rid of
people the best I ever seen--I mean people that would come in overstaying
their time. He could handle that thing the best--you almost had to
get home and think about it--that your ass was kicked was out of therer-without
your realizing it.
BB: Everett Jordan seemed to be different, i^* &#x27;
HM; Very--take time. I&#x27;ve seen him fwferft hang up on a person--just
telephone--just hang right up.
BB: Didn&#x27;t they call him the &quot;minuteman&quot; because he was so prompt?
HM: Prompt? Oh...we had a lawyer from here that was going to be
appointed judge and was going to be sworn in and Hodges was invited
to/lthe swearing-in. &#x27; was even late for his funeral when
he died a few years ago. I told &#x27; ___, &quot;We&#x27;re going to come
down there at ten o&#x27;clock when you&#x27;re supposed to be sworn in, and if
you are not there, he won&#x27;t be there to swear you in. I&#x27;m telling you,
just like a friend.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do you like you did
me the first time I was ever on a jury, you was the solicitor, there
was a big black woman had been cut across her breast--great big--and
it so happened that my chair was right in front of her--I could almost
reach over and touch--smell her goodness knows. And he was making this
charge and he says, &quot;Now I want you to share with the gentlemen of the
jury how you were slashed and mutilated,&quot; And she started opening that

Harold Makepeace -23-
thing and pulling that thing out and I just turned my head--I didn&#x27;t
want to see that black thing--almost sticking in my face. I just turned
my head. She got it all back and everything--that son-of-a-gun says,
&quot;Now I feel that there&#x27;s one member of the jury that failed to observe
the mutilation that you had and I&#x27;m afraid that he will be unable to
make a just decision—show this to him.&quot; And he grinned you knowr-and
there she pulled that dern thing again. So I had a mind to pay him
back at this swearing-in ceremony.
BB: Was he there on time?
HM: Yes sir! He was there waiting.
Sometimes you didn&#x27;t think he would enjoy what he was doing--but
he did. A lot of his speeches at a school building or someplace--when
they would start coming out the front he would go out the back.
BB: Didn&#x27;t he want to see the people?
HM: I think he kind of figured they didn&#x27;t want to see him!! I think
he honestly felt that way sometimes. It was just his nature

cocktail party or whatever it might be and it got ten o&#x27;clock
...he went home. Early riser. He&#x27;d get up at five o&#x27;clock every
morning. You never saw any papers or anything On his desk in the
Governor&#x27;s office. He&#x27;d get up every morning--the chauffeur would
get all the mail and everything--he had a box--carry it to the mansion—
he&#x27;d get up at five in the morning. Son-of-a-gun would call me some
times at five o&#x27;clock in the morning. He always answered the letters
on his back in the box, carry it back to his secretary and that
was it. He was tending to business—state government—instead of
answering letters

BB: As his secretary, when he was Governor, your primary function was
to do what?
HM: Like....lady friends...it came out in the paper--I&quot; came home that
weekend--saw her at church--she said, &quot;You never did tell me you
could write on a typewriter [laughs] private secretary! I says&#x27; &quot;No
I can&#x27;t even take shorthand.&quot; Then I told her It was like onetime
he left on a trip somewhere and he didn&#x27;t call , the Lt. Gov.
and I got involved in some of that dad blame stuff--I just told
the Governor to get old Lt. Gov. .&#x27; listen Luther, &quot;The Governor
is going to be gone for a few more days and I&#x27;m snowed under--some
things I&#x27;m supposed to be doing--I&#x27;m doing&#x27;-&#x27;-in fact I was in the
Governor&#x27;s office. I said, &quot;I can&#x27;t do it all. I&#x27;ll send a patrol
car up tlhere after you or I&#x27;ll send a plane after you--you won&#x27;t have
to do a thing but get in it and come over here and stay a few days.&quot;
And do you know that son-of-a-gun woundn&#x27;t do it!
BB: Lt. Gov.?
HM: You take an average person--Lieutenant Governor would have been
there--I wouldn&#x27;t ha*ve had to send for him. He would have loved that--
coming in and taking charge you see ...trying to get rid of him.
He never did come. Everytime he-ever left or tq be gone--he never did
come over there.
BB: He just didn&#x27;t want to do it? Too busy or what?
HM: No he wasn&#x27;t too busy, he was just that type of guy,
BB; What did Hodges say to him when he gtft back, anything?
HM: Nothing. Hodges didn&#x27;t even ask him to come. I was the one that
did the asking.
BB; I know you were the one that had all the work to do. Did Hodges
ever criticize you for anything you did?

Harold Makepeace -25-
HM: No [laughs] I&#x27;d tell him to go jump in the water. No we got
along real good--I knew him well enough--we played golf together--
back then I would drive with a three iron--I couldn&#x27;t drive with a
wood--one time we been to Pinehurst got back over here to Haw River
told the driver to stop. He said I want you to take that three iron
that
and I want to throw it right in the middle of/dern river [laughs].
He said, &quot;If I&#x27;d do that then you couldn&#x27;t even hit a ball--if you
didn&#x27;t have that three iron.&quot;
BB: So you agree that Henry Jordan was a better politician?
HM: I think that Everett, as a fund raiser, was tops. Everybody can&#x27;t
do that.
BB: I wonder why he was so good at it--people he knew or
HM: Well people he knew--and he knew all them big shots in the state
and they of course, knew him. That&#x27;s number one and as I say, back
then they had a pretty close organization. The Republican Party just
wasn&#x27;t in it. And the Democratic Party just wouldn&#x27;t give them a
chance to stick their heads up out of the water. It was easy!
BB; The Democrats had all the big money didn&#x27;t they?
the Broyhills
HM: Oh sure! Sure--they almost still have--take / and that group-of
course it&#x27;s changing now. So many of these people are Republicans.
You know I remember a lot of people came from Massachusetts and that
area way back when they first came down here and I remember an old
she lived to be ninety some years old--but they were staunch
Republicans. She thought that a Democrat down here--he just wasn&#x27;t
anything. And you know that thing is reversed now? ...switched ...
up there. Take the average Democrat now-- at Chicago--I&#x27;m
not exaggerating—he had an afternoon cocktail party at a big hotel--
elaborate place. And we went to it--and I&#x27;m telling you the honest

truth--with the characters that were there--I was afraid to get my
back away from the wall! No kidding--I just never seen people that
you
looked like that--do/remember the guy that used to wear the dark
glasses all the time--they finally ran him out of the--crooked as a
rattlesnake--from New York--he was the top Democrat man and always
wore black glasses--nice looking guy.
BB: Wasn&#x27;t Javits was it?
HM: He never was elected office or anything he was these Democrats--
just like Everett was to the Democratic Party in North Carolina. But
that was in his heyday--and they had all--you couldn&#x27;t--why the way
they had things set up with the type of people--a decent person couldn&#x27;t
get elected in a ward or anyplace to save their neck. Couldn&#x27;t
possibly.
BB: I understand that when Everett JOrdan was Chairman of the Democratic
Party he pretty well controlled things. How did he do this?
HM: Well he was just a top-rated politician. Organizer.
BB: Did he know all these people in the various counties?
HM: Yeah. And the newspaper people were with Everett.
BB: Were for Him?
HM: Yeah. He got good--
BB: Except when he got appointed to the Senate?
HM: Why sure then they--they you get--after that but they couldn&#x27;t
do anything or control him when he was head of the Democratic party.
Back then, patronage was terrific--coming through from the county
level right on up to him you see.
BB: If you wanted a job you had to be a democrat.
HM: Right. You dern right. See Luther didn&#x27;t do that at all. He
didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the Democratic Chairman in the state or
the ones down here. He figured they didn&#x27;t elect him.

Harold Makepeace -27-
BB: Is the patronage not as strong now as it was then?
HM: I think it&#x27;s just a bad. Look at Hunt--what do you think? He&#x27;s
the best politician since Simmons--Senator Simmons--he&#x27;s got the best--
I didn&#x27;t vote for him; never will vote for him,
BB: What&#x27;s Hunt&#x27;s ambition?
HM: He&#x27;s going to run for Senate. He&#x27;s a--well they said that the
most Terry Sanford ever made as a lawyer was $6,000 a year when he
was elected Governor--I was told that down in Fayetteville. See, he
didn&#x27;t even go back to his hometown of Laurenburg to practice law--
you can tell he&#x27;s not sharp--he couldn&#x27;t compare with Luther Hodges.
This Jim Hunt--if he hadn&#x27;t got in the Governorship he couldn&#x27;t have
made a decent living--he&#x27;d have been farming.
BB: Did he study law?
HM: He&#x27;s a lawyer.
BB: He&#x27;s a great organizer they say.
HM: Oh boy! He&#x27;s got enough commissions—what was it--he appointed
three people here the other day--Fair Treatment, something--anyway they
went to a highway meeting down here in Aberdeen and I thought then--I
says, &quot;If those three !* I would love to have gone--I bet they didn&#x27;t
open their mouth--they wouldn&#x27;t have known what to have said!! Gee, I--
but he&#x27;s got that all over the state. And another thing; he&#x27;s got some
people that Luther Hodges had--big people! Just as tied up as this
other group--I mean big people.
BB: Committed to him?
HM: Yes sir! They&#x27;re committed to him--whole hog!
BB: Harold, there is a limit which you can//to a campaign is there not?
HM; Legally?
„&gt;.&#x27;■■&#x27;■,. i- -&#x27;&#x27; ■H* * &#x27; ■-.&#x27;

was planning on coming by there today.&quot; They&#x27;d say, &quot;How about dropping

<dc:description>&#x27;tj* ;I&#x27;m in the home of Harold Makepeace in Sanford, NC. This is August 6, 1982.-I Have known Harold now for a number of years and we will be discussing Everett Jordan and Luther Hodges. Ben Bulla:  Harold, If you will please, tell me when and where you met Everett Jordan. - HM:  I met Everett Jordan in 1952--that was when he had the restaurant in Danville and they had&quot; oire at Durham called Jorges, Inc,, on Hwy. 15 and 501 between Durham and Chapel Hill.  That&#x27;s when I first met BEJ. Everett went iA with!Luther. and another igiay at Danville in that restaurant business up there.  Then as things progressed they got involved in one or two more Howard Johnson&#x27;s.  They had one on 301 and one on 87; Bragg Boulevard. BB:  Were you involved in any more? HM:  No, those three and then Clarence,and myself rented the one from C.3.                                        A &quot;Coda, Jones (?) over in Raleigh.. .renting from the Jordans when this happened over in Raleigh...we tried to buy the one in Chapel Hill a number of times but they didn&#x27;t show any interest in selling it. BB:  The one in Chapel Hill was prosperous wasn&#x27;t it? HM:  Yes.  The most prosperous one was on 301.  Tom Pearsall bought it. Then when Luther Hodges was running for Lt. Gov. I didn&#x27;t know Everett too well.  I was. Luther&#x27;s so called campaign managers-he knew hardly h&#x27;9b&#x27;*i6   h*iw* i&amp;.    ft97AM/ //fr^nMir***-&#x27;.&#x27;&quot;:&#x27;   *   . , , anyone in political life_Ln_MG J.,.1*1/.. .&gt;and that was our base-ffffc*r**p W getting him elected as Lt. Gov.....and meeting with Everett in the business of the restaurants we discussed a lot of politics.  Everett, back then, 1 think, wanted to be governor of NCI don&#x27;t think there is any doubt.because he would say something to me about Luther progressing so fast.  He would say that, &quot;Luther hasn&#x27;t come up through the ranks&quot; like they did back then--Cherry and Urnstead and Broughton; Gardneryou knew a number of years before who the next governor was going to be. BB:  The party promoted them through the ranks to be governor? Harold Makepeace                                  _2_ HM:&#x27; In&#x27;fact, you could almost know there for a while who was going ( to be the next governor.  ...my brother served three terms in the State Senate and two in the House.. And Everett would talk to me knowing I was going to tell Luther; and Luther would do the same thing; knowing that I was going to tellI was the go-between a,lot of times there on  what each one was thinking.  As I said Everett said, &quot;Luther is just going too fast; ne ought to come up through the ranks.-&quot; I know one/*time we Went ove*, to/the. State Democratic Meeting over at the Sir Walter when he was running for Lt. Gov.  I can just see us now; Luther and I standing in that lobby?-why you would have thought Hodges : was a bastard at a family reunion almostthey just weren&#x27;t having anything to do with Luther Hodges because Roy Rowe was running and he Aa/p  $&lt;?*&#x27;*&#x27; had been SenatorSenate pro tern, **e.--he was working his way up you :   &#x27;     :: :.&quot; m know and was running for Lt, Gov.  Everybody was for him.  He was from a little town--WafsaW? or something.  He was a real strong politician and he could have called for a runoff but he didn&#x27;t.  They put Luther in as Lt. Gov.  Then after the death of Gov. Umstead he filled out his unexpired term of two years and then ran on his own. BB:  You were his campaign manager when he ran for Lt. Gov. and Gov.? HM:  This was his headquarters here in Sanford.  He would come down and we would work out from here.  I&#x27;d use my car one day and then he&#x27;d use his.  He paid his expenses and I&#x27;d pay mine.  One time he and Everett spent the night here.  My favorite breakfast back in my young days was fried chicken, gravy, sweet potatoes and hot biscuits, etc., so I told Helen to let&#x27;s surprise them and serve that for breakfast; so she got ut&gt; early the next morning and got it ready and they talked about that .    , ,                                                                                  they breakfast from then onabout that big breakfast that/had at Harold Makepeace&#x27;s house.  The morining that the Gov. announced that he was Harold Makepeace                                      -3- appointing Everett Jordan as United States Senator I was on a trip out ;t where,had sent me! ./&gt;. . y\ fi &quot;. ( . t. . . and he told West where,had sent me;./&gt;.. i&quot; r..&#x27;.....and he told me about 8:30 that morning.  He said, &quot;I havn&#x27;t slept all night.  In business, in politics (HA-   1014^  &#x27; L nave, never been under such pressure. *TfT7T7y. .TTZZ He said they really gave him fits 63-)......he was a good state senator, and I have never been under such pressure. &#x27;VrTTTTT). .T7TJordan&quot; U S Senator.&quot; he was real active with Everett Jordan in the Democratic Party and so when Luther appointed him  Senator he just gave me hell (Ben to whom is he referring?)....couldn&#x27;t understand why Luther Hodges would appoint Everett Jordan to the Senate.....now the older group, as I could see, were all in favor of it; it was the younger Democrats.....wanted Terry Sanford or who.  Anyway, they soon got over it. BB:  According to the press Hodges appointed Jordan for a temporary thing; as a seat warmerthat he, himself, wanted that seat later on. HM:  I tried my best to get him to appoint Ben Trotter, and just make a statement that, &quot;I am appointing Ben Trotter to fill out the unexpired term of Senator Scott and my intentions are to run for U S Senate when my term expires as Governor.&quot; He wouldn&#x27;t agree to itI thought that eventually he was going to run for the Senate but then Kennedy appointed him Commerce SEcretary you know. BB:  Harold, when Hodges appointed Jordan to the Senate do you think they discussed that Hodges wanted to run for that seat in a couple year&#x27;s time maybe? HM:  I don&#x27;t think so.  No siree! BB:  No deal then?  The press thought there was. HM:  It was never indicatedI never felt or anything-Vthe logical person would have Appoint e^Ben Trotter........she died first.  But he was the most logical.  I understand now whyI think I know why.  I didn&#x27;t find out until he was Secretary of Commerce.  We went on a trip up to Harold Makepeace                                          -4- Washington on Kennedy&#x27;s Sequoia.^YX...Ben^got drunk__that was the first time I found out he was an alcoholic.  ..I told..Ben should have been..to appoint...head of ABC--Chairman.  I think Ben wanted it the way he discussed it but after this thing happened on the boatafter we got back to the dock in Washington we couldn&#x27;t find Ben Trotter didn&#x27;t know if he had fallen overboard or what.  Hodges told me to go back on the boat and go downstairs where they cookthe galley there was old Ben down there.  He was just having a helluva time /laughs7 F         Puerto Rican.....President&#x27;s ship.....Trotter.....you know.

I had to sit next to him and that&#x27;s the first time I had known he was an alcoholic.  I never had remembered when we were off anyplace him taking a drink......Everett ever tell you___married in Gastonia ...off an orange crate?  Lived in one of the mill houses and they didn&#x27;t have money enough to buy furniture...... tell you that? BB:  Why did Hodges appoint Jordan? I think there was a lot of pressure From whom? HM BB HM EEEverett E-E-Everettthe Democratic Partyera segment of the Democratic Party?-the older ones. BB:  Who was the old guard then? HM: BB: [battery is weak and conversation is garbled and unintelligible] viiw   wclo   cut:   uiu   guara   men.&#x27; Harold Makepeace                                       -5- [Tape #2 - new battery] BB:  Harold will you repeat our earlier conversation.  If you would just briefly tell me how you met Everett Jordan. HM:  I met Senator Jordan around 1952.  Luther Hodges was a candidate for Lt. Gov.  Hodges, Jordan and myself were in the reataurant business. BB:  These restaurants were in Chapel Hill.and also-- HM:  We leased the one from them in Chapel Hill and we built the large one down on 301 outside of Fayetteville.  Gov. Hodges, Senator Jordan and myself. BB:  When did you first meet Hodges? HM:  My daddy was cabin roommate in 1928 when he went to Europe to a Rotary convention and I have been knowing him ever since.  We became more active after he retired from Fieldcrest because he lived in New York and Chicago and other places when he was with them.  After he retired from Marshall-Field he called me one night and said, &quot;What do you think about me running for Lt. Gov.&quot;  I said, &quot;You want to start in the morning?&quot; He laughed of course--he got some more friends; mainly Rotarians and business associates because ho had never been real active in statewide politics.  I think he was on the highway commission way back years ago and it wasn&#x27;t as important then as it is now.  We started a campaign and got a few_____for a long time he wouldn&#x27;t even have a card to present a person.  We talked him into getting a few of those then he was bashful at first to give the card out--we&#x27;d give the card out and he just/wasn&#x27;t used to that kind of operation.  All the politicians said it would be almost impossible to defeat Roy Rowe that had been in the Legislature--a Senator for numbers of terms. BB:  Where was Roy from? .... .- - Harold Makepeace                                       -6- HM:  Some little town down here in Sampson Countyv-in that area there. BB:  What had he done before he ran against Hodges? HM:  He was a lawyer--been active in the Democratic Party--close friend of Everett Jordan. BB:  He was a professional politician then? HM:  Yeah.  We started the state campaign for Lt. Gov. and the Rotary friends, etc.  From there built up a right good organization.  When we went in to get the real politician&#x27;s support they said that they were sorry, but they were for Rowe.  But at the end Hodges was high man out of the three--I forget who the other candidate was.  Mr. Rowe could have called for a second primary but he was advised not to.  In fact Lynn Nesbitt the newspaper writer from Raleigh called me during that timer-he supported Rowe but he had advised him not to call for a second primary because he did not think he could defeat Hodges.  Later on, after intergration came up, Rowe told the Governor that he was thankful that he had been elected instead of himself; that he had done a grand job in handling that proposition and he didn&#x27;t think that he, himself, could have done it.  That developed into the Governor and Jordan becoming closer friends politically, etc. BB:  Everett Jordan supported Hodges in the Governor&#x27;s race but I&#x27;m wondering when and where Jordan met Hodges? HM:  I can&#x27;t tell you right off the bat that Everett supported Luther in the Lt. Gov. race.  I really don&#x27;t recall. BB:  Did he know Hodges then? HM:  Yes. BB:  Jordan was also active in the Rotary, it could be that he met Hodges in the Rotary.  i HM:  Well I don&#x27;t think Everett was that active........I don&#x27;t know how And you leased one over in Raleigh? Clarence Daniels and I did--from -Getta Jones. Did you have any part in that one in Greensboro? No that was Luther and Jones in Raleigh. I think so.  Jordan was not involved in the one in Greensboro. Then Luther, Jr. and Bmdm  Jones built the one over here outside Harold Makepeace                                       -7- the tie-in started with Hodges and Jordan in the Howard Johnson&#x27;s business.  Luther was in with one of the Vice Presidents or one of the workers of the mill up there [in Danville] I forget the fellow&#x27;s namethey were real close friendsI guess they invited Everett to join them in Danville.  Then they got the franchise for Chapel Hill. Hodges sold out then and we two built the one down on Bragg Blvd. and the one on 301 in Fayetteville. BB HM: BB: HM: BB: HM: of Durham on Interstate 85t-north of Durham.  I reckon they still own it. BB:  Is @*da Jones still living? HM:  Yeah, he&#x27;s a multi-millionaire now, lives in Raleighsmall contractor; Davison and Jones.......just hit everything at the right time..... BB:  Did the Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant have a big part in it? HM:  No.  That was mine.  That HJ he owned out there north of Raleigh that never was a big--in fact we gave it up after a year or two.  There wasn&#x27;t that much tourist trade on No. 1. BB:  You were Hodges campaign manager when he ran for Governor? HM:  Yes. BB:  When he ran for Lt. Gov. too? HM:  Well we didn&#x27;t designate anyone back then; we just all worked together.  He and myself traveled all over the state together.  He financed his own program as Lt. Gov.  I paid my own expenses and fed Harold Makepeace                                       -8- him when he was here. BB:  But you were unofficially his campaign manager? HM:  Yeah.  Didn&#x27;t have any titles back then--he was new at politics that was my first state-wide campaign. BB:  What did you do as campaign manager? HM:  Went all over the state with him--back and forth from one end to the other a number of times. BB:  Did you make speeches for him? HM:  No.  Mainly he was meeting the people.  The Rotarians throughout the state were a big help to him in the race for Lt. Gov.  That was our base to get started. BB:  You knew the people across the state through Rotary? HM:  I knew them through Scouting too.  I was president of Ocaneechee Council for two years along that time and he had been active in Boy Scouting also.  The manufacturing friends that Hodges knew came to his aid, but the real politicians in the Lt. Gov. race were not supportive of Hodges. BB:  Do you mind telling me why? HM:  Well back then you came up through the ranks to become Lt. Gov., Governor--way back there you knew about two terms ahead who was going to be next.  I delivered messages between Everett and Luther Hodges, and I think that they knew that I was carrying it back and forth, because they were feeling each other out--Everett came up through the Democratic party as a hard worker and he thought that was what everyone else should do to reach the higher post such as Senator and Governor and I personally think that he wanted to be Governor of North Carolina.  In fact he told me one time, &quot;Luther hadn&#x27;t come up through the ranks--he&#x27;s traveling too fast.&quot;  In a good natured way, he wasn&#x27;t vicious about it or anything Harold Makepeace                                       -9- The morning that he appointed Everett to the Senate he called me, he had sent me out west on some business, I forget what, he got hold of me about 8:30 that morning and said, &quot;Harold I havn&#x27;t slept a wink all night,.  In business and politics that I have been in; I have never been pressured as much in my life as I have in the last few weeks.  I&#x27;ve made a decision and I&#x27;m going to announce at 11:00 o&#x27;clock that I&#x27;m fill appointing B. Everett Jordan of Saxapahaw to/the unexpired term of Senator Scott.&quot;  I was hoping that the Governor was interested in going to the Senate himself.  Why didn&#x27;t he appoint someone that was a close friend and legal attorney like Ben Trotter to keep the seat warm until his term expired as Governor, then he could run.  But he was not interested I wasn&#x27;t the only one that tried to get him to do it. BB:  You did not think that Everett Jordan would be a seat warmer for him? HM:  I don&#x27;t think so.  I don&#x27;t think so. BB:  Hodges never mentioned that to you? HM:  Never was, but he refused to put Ben Trotter as a seat warmer. [This is the end of side one tape #2] .......Ben Trotter.. anyone--BB:  He wasn&#x27;t obligated to/lkexBKmBEialiKxBaxlfxasxsNEhxxkEXKBKia KppHiHtxaHyHHKXlhalxhExwaHisHxtHX HM:  The Democratic Party, as such, that he could appoint most anyone that he wanted to.  I, as well as some of his other frionds, tried to get him to appoint Ben Trotter before Everett ever entered into the thing. BB:  Was Ben Trotter agreeable? HM:  I don&#x27;t know whether Ben ever knew it ornot,  I found out later why he wasn&#x27;t appointednot only that, but to a state jo*b in Raleigh. BB:  Do you mind telling me why?                                                   ^ Harold Makepeace                                       -10- HM:  Well when the ABC chairmanship became vacant there was a lot of interest in Ben Trotter being appointed to that chairmanship.  He had had problems in that area, personally, and just wasn&#x27;t suitable to be on that particular committee. The first time I knew he had a drinking problem was when we went to Washington and were on Kennedy&#x27;s private yacht, Sequoia.  We had dinner on it and went down to Mount Vernon, etc.  And when we got back to Washington to get off we missed Ben.  Of course we had all had cocktails and so onr-the Governor asked me to go back to get him.  So I went back and went down in the galley and there he was.  He was having a big time down there with the Puerto Rican chefs [laughs].  We got off and _______ and Ed Rankin, Ben Trotter and myself tried to get a train back home-were unable to and finally took a bus and rode all night.  When we got to Raleigh Ben was still having a little problem.  He was just one of those people that couldn&#x27;t take a drink and control himself.  A lot are that way.  But he was a great friend of Luther Hodgesin fact he was the treasurer of the campaign. BB:  He raised money for Luther Hodges? HM:  Well he was head of it.  We had different ones like Hugh Morton, Gordon Gilmore and othersAl Leshothers were raising the money.  Ben, like the Governor wasn&#x27;t in the inner circle of the political party like Everett Jordan was.  Hodges wouldn&#x27;t let me tell him or let Trotter tell himor he wouldn&#x27;t look at the treasurer&#x27;s bookwho had donated  how much or anything and a $1,000 was the most we would accept from any one person.  I turned back a lot of checks for $5,000 or more. BB:  That was so Hodges wouldn&#x27;t be obligated to any one person? HM:  That&#x27;s what he said,  &quot;He just didn&#x27;t want to be obligated to anyone.&quot; It was a new day for him as far as that goes.  When I was Harold Makepeace                                   -11- appointed as his campaign--state manager--I couldn&#x27;t mess around the Governor&#x27;s offica a&#x27;tall.  He was still the Governor of N C and he was attending to the duties.  Fact is, he did more campaigning in the Lt. Gov. race than he did in the Governor&#x27;s race.  He hardly needed a managerfor we refunded 25% to each person that donated, after campaigning was over and all expenses were paid.  Which that was the first time that was ever done and it was such a nice thing to do that the News and Observer didn&#x27;t put much of it in the paper. BB:  Has anyone ever done that since then? HM:  I think it&#x27;s been done once or twice in some race I don&#x27;t know whether it was the Governor&#x27;s race or not. We were at the                       at the Sir Walter Hotel that night--had a few cocktails.  There were some friends from the western part of the state and Everett Jordan--and brought him a paper bag full of home-made sausage that Everett was so fond of.  We started down in the elevatorwe stopped to pick up a passengerit was tiny little old lady.  When she got in the elevator--she figured we had had a cocktail or two and she had her eye on this paper bagjust staring at it. Everett noticed it and he just dropped it right in the middle of the elevator carand said, &quot;Lady, that&#x27;s not what you thought it was.&quot; Then she kind of broke a smile--it was funny--I can see him dropping that sack now, and it hitflooosh! BB:  When Hodges appointed Jordan to the Senate some folks have said that Hodges wanted to get John Larkin out as chairman of the Democratic Party.  So one of the conditions of the appointment was that Jordan help him get Larkin replaced. HM:  I know that John and the Governor didn&#x27;t hit it off a hundred percent together.  Their thinking was a little bit diffrent,  politically. Harold Makepeace                                 -12- That&#x27;s just kind of hard to believe.  I don&#x27;t see how he would have to make that sort of appointment--being Governor--to get rid of John Larkin as Democrat chairman.  The Governor never said anything to me about it--I knew that they did not gee-haw or get along as close friends. BB:  Did you ever have any contact with John Larkin? HM:  Yes I was with him at two Democratic conventions.  One in Chicago and in California.  He was a very likeable person; you could not help from liking the guy. BB:  Was it sort of a personality clash? HM:  I think that was it.  And John was more acclimated politically than the Governor.  It&#x27;s like I told you about meeting Jonathan Daniels in the hall of the Sir Walter Hotel shortly after Hodges was elected Governor and Mr. Daniels told the Governor, &quot;Well politics makes a lot of strange bedfellows.&quot;  Luther&#x27;s reply was, &quot;Well I don&#x27;t have to sleep with themV and walked off. BB:  He didn&#x27;t want to sleep with John Larkin either, did he? HM:  No, he didn&#x27;t want to sleep with John Larkin either.  John is a real likeable fellow.  Typical, nice, good eastern boyloved politics. He and Thad Eure came from the same area down there.  You know I&#x27;m afraid that Thad Eure is going to keep on running until somebody comes along and beats him and it&#x27;s a shame.  He ought to quit while he&#x27;s ahead, BB HM BB HM BB HM It would kill his spirit if that happens. He wouldn&#x27;t live two months, probably, after, This hurt Everett Jordan very much when he lost. Its bound to have. Would you analyze for me why you think Jordan lost? Well I think the illness and his age--he had made a good Senator- he and Ervin made a good pair; working together--but here&#x27;s the time Harold Makepeace                                 -13- when the youth came along running against a man for a six year term-running a man with some age and illness and the strikes were just against him.  I could feel it and 1 think most of them could feel it. Somebody probably didn&#x27;t tell Everett all he should have known. BB HM BB HM Did you and Hodges both tell him? I don&#x27;t know whether Luther--I feel that he did. Did you tell him? I told him--I told him that I thought it would be a losing deal for the simple reason of his health and age was against him. BB:  What did he say? HM:  I don&#x27;t remember. BB;  Were you in Washington or Saxapahaw or where? HM:  I can&#x27;t tell you that.  It might have been here or it might have been on the road or something.  I tI&#x27;d certainly support him and help him in every way I could possibly do and I was sure that Hodges would do the same thing but  KB;  Did you ever confer with Jordan on any political matters? HM:  No.  I never had any--other than I might call him or write him to tell him that somebody from Sanford was coming up and to please we would appreciate any favors or considerations7- BB; How would you describe the relationship between Hodges and Jordan? HM:  I thought they were always friendly or they wouldn&#x27;t have asked Everett to start in business up there in Danville. BB:  Politicians had to--;- &#x27; HM;  Different politic--Everett was a seasoned politician and Luther Hodges wasn&#x27;t.  Luther Hodges wasn&#x27;t the mixer that Everett Jordan-Everett Jordan would keep you laughing the whole time you were with him?-with some of his antics and so on. BB:  Do you remember any of the stories he told? Harold Makepeace ...                             -14- HM:  I heard plenty of them--if I could remember--some of them I couldn&#x27;t tell [laughs]. BB:  Have you got one you can tell me? HM:  NO.  I wish I couldi^/I used to remember jokes and could tell them--I can&#x27;t.  I got a sOn,Richard, he knows the Waitress&#x27; first namehe knows more people in North Carolina right now and can call them by their first name, than I can and he&#x27;s never been in politics. [Tape #3 side 1] ......from High Point... on the newspaper in High Pointwhat  BB:  Holt McPherson?  &#x27;-  .                                                                                       f, HM:  It was Holt&#x27;s boss; the old man--they appointed him Attorney GeneralAtchison..Atkinson of the North Carolina Guard.  He&#x27;s still living--ninety some years old.  If I had my list all I&#x27;d do would just turn to High Point. BB:  Why did he criticize him? HM:  Well he was not an army man.  I don&#x27;t know if you know how promotions are made in the army and state guardyou just get in the right group you see.  We&#x27;ve had Lt. Colonels in Sanford here--Colonels and everything elsehe had a man that just didn&#x27;t have any leanings in that area a&#x27;tall.  CAPUS WAYNICK!! Doggone itI&#x27;d get it.  The newspapers and a lot of them just raising hell.  I called him private. I&#x27;d call over there and tell his secretary I wanted to speak to private Waynick.  He got a big kick out of thatwhen/he left over there he turned in and wrote the nicest letter.....___says I know you are pretty high up in the affairs over there in the Governor&#x27;s office-he always had a little---.........back here and he appreciated...... Harold Makepeace                                 -15- me keeping it.  There was more &quot;ruckus&quot; over that than when Everett was-- BB:  Folks who criticized the appointment of Everett Jordan were the young folks in the Democratic Party. HM:  I think it was the younger element--there was one high up in the Democratic Party that held some of the high positions were really upset at his appointing Everett Jordan to the United States Senate. BB:  Did he say why? HM:  Just the general purpose that a- BB:  Didn&#x27;t think he was qualified? HM:  Didn&#x27;t think he was qualified in the first place and that was when the young people were getting more interested--Terry Sanford was elected young as the Governor,which was unheard of--almost.... Bob Scott ......taking over... thought...younger people should be appointed. I told you about kidding Bill the other day about it.  After you called me I said, &quot;By the way, Ben Bulla was so close to Everett Jordan--that you fussed so much aboutwas going to be down...tell him why you was so opposed to him.&quot;  He said, &quot;Just let by-gones be by-gones.&quot; BB:  Bill who? HM:  Staton.  He had served ten years in the state senatemade a good representativestayed out for about four terms and ran againdidn&#x27;t beat the man in Raleigh. BB:  .....folks who were eligible to be appointed to the Senate when Jordan was. You mentioned Ben Trotter and also a man named Goraid Saunders that might be considered for that post. Why would Hodges consider Bill Saunders? HM:  I don&#x27;t know that he was one of them.  He could have been a possibility because they were long time friends and associated in the Harold Makepeace                                 -16- same type of businesstextile business.  I forget the company he represented--that was down in Aberdeen--big mill, been operating  ever since.  Enormous plant--one of the biggest mills in Moore County I&#x27;d say.  They have a big outlet store and everything. BB:  Would Bill Saunders have been receptive to the idea; do you think? HM:  I believe he would.  That&#x27;s quite an honor just to get to be Senator you know. BB:  We were discussing earlier about Hodges ambition to become Vice-President under the Kennedy administration--did you ever hear Hodges discuss that? HM:  No.  Out in California Lloyd Gilmore and Hugh Morton and some of us thought that wrangling was going on out there with Lyndon Johnson and Governor Brown and different ones...........in fact we had a few placards where would start marching inside the convention hallthing looked like it was gonna turnin fact we contacted a few of the delegation and got a good response. BB:  For Hodges for Vice-President? HM:  Yeah.  GocTa good responseparticularly from some of the western states. BB:  That was 1960 wasn&#x27;t it? HM:  ..... BB:Later on you said that Hodges went to Washington in the Cabinet with Kennedy and that he never did have much success in getting a private meeting with the Presidentthat he always had his son in-- HM:  ......it never was as serious a meeting as Hodges would have preferred.  In other words if he had something that he wanted to take up with the President he would certainly want it seriously considered. Kennedy would be on the floor playing with his son, John John. Harold Makepeace                                 -17- BB:  Knowing Hodges, that must have irked him. really HM:  Yeah it irked him.  Luther told me one time that he never/had a sit-down discussion with the President as he thought it should be. ___just didn&#x27;twasn&#x27;t interested in that particular phase of his problem.  I know one time President Kenndey asked him to represent him down in Mexico.for three days--which he did--but he, just for curiosity, had Mitchell Havinger, his secretary to call the airport to see how much it would cost to send him down there for three days in this plane.  As I remember it was around $25,000 and instead of using it he goes commercial.  I said, &quot;Well you&#x27;re just a_______ if you had a bunch of people up there that would go in with you on this kind of savings well and good, but you are just one little man up there and would be about the only politician that would even think about that. BB:  Hodges was a good business man--he knew the value of a dollar. HM:  Heck yeah.  I went up there and stayed with him about a month when he first went up there.to help him get his office force and so on........and I saw right off he had a secretary that had been secretary to the other Commerce Department head--I saw that she wouldn&#x27;t last two weeks under Luther Hodges; and I told her so.  I said, &quot;If you stay with him six months, you&#x27;ll love the guy.  The first few weeks you&#x27;re going to hate him--he ain&#x27;t going to put up with stuff that I see going on up here now, I don&#x27;t give a dern who it is.&quot;  I went back up there a month or two later and I said, &quot;Where&#x27;s Mrs. Miller?&quot; He said,&quot;I tell you what I had to do to get her out of the office.  I had to give her an office; had to give her a title; had to give her a secretary.&quot;  I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot; He said, &quot;Alright you know both of them--go to office so-and-so and you&#x27;ll find Harold Makepeace                                 -18-                      &#x27;, them.&quot;  I went around there and there they were....a blame thing. BB:  Why didn&#x27;t he just fire her? HM:  Civil Service!  Civil Service the autocrats--the bureaucrats-- ........chauffeur had one of the prettiest mahogany paneled offices that you&#x27;ve ever seen.  He used a private elevator that Kennedy used to......I think maybe 18 or 20 thousand working in that big building. By the time they all get there and get settled in the office it&#x27;s coffee break.  You can&#x27;t even walk in the halls....I told the Governor if then that/everybody can see what&#x27;s going on in just this one building there&#x27;d be a revolution tomorrow. BB:  This was the Secretary of Commerce office building? HM:  Yeah.  Well I went down to   &#x27; _______ office, he was in the weight division sold scales and allmarried to Rachel________, Hodges secretary....appointed in the   &#x27;_____department.  I walked in and he was as mad as anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I said, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter P. G.?&quot; He said, &quot;Well you know, here at lunch these secretaries and all go out to these restaurants and have two or three cocktails and they come back--two of them came back today and one of them picked up an ink bottle and threw it at the other one.  I wanted to fire them.&quot;  I said, &quot;Well why don&#x27;t you?&quot;  He says, &quot;Well I&#x27;ve got to prove that she intended to murder or kill the girl that she threw the ink bottle at.&quot; He finally didn&#x27;t stay on--he couldn&#x27;t take it.  I remember one day during the inauguration this black chauffeur--Luther Jr. wanted to do something, I forget whatboy he told him off right quick!  Says, &quot;He don&#x27;t tell me what to do.&quot; Damn black n-chauffeur.  Of course he had a secretary in his officeblack chauffeur. BB:  Why does a chauffeur need a secretary? &lt; HCTrifLdr Makepeace                                  -19- HM:  That&#x27;s what I want to know, [laughs]  I&#x27;m sorry, and I always will regret it that I didn&#x27;t go up there and stay a year just to really see.  However we went on the yacht, and it&#x27;s a beautiful ship. You get on down in the basin somewhere near a big bridge.  We got on boarddidn&#x27;t see an American--Captain of the ship; waiter, porter or whateverall Puerto Ricans.  Softest job down there or up there-be on a private yacht for somebody to use....few cocktails or something. And in the boat basin there are a lot of private yachtspeople spending a week--a few days sightseeing, etc. and as we went out the ship hit the bridge and tore off a piece of the metalwell you never heard such booing in your life as the people sitting out there on those boatssitting on the deck having a drink.  So when we got back that night we came in all right--from the dock you never heard such applause in your life.  Got back through without hitting the cement abutment.  [laughs]  All Puerto Ricans! BB:  You&#x27;d think that on the President&#x27;s yacht they would have the very top, qualified people. HM:  Why certainly!  We were out on the Potomac there--there came on the loud speaker that the President of the United States was approaching. A much smaller boat.  All of us, of course, went on deck Kennedy  just a regular size little old open board motor boat but he had secret service men all around him you knowother boats.  He wavedof course they gave the signal back to him.....promised .....Luther.... BB:  I wonder how Hodges and Kennedy got along as politicians working together?  Different styles; different philosophy. HM:  Well two people just completely differentmode of living and everything else. BB:  Why did Kennedy appoint Hodges; because of his ability or because Harold Makepeace                                 -20- of his political influence. HM:  His ability.  See he went on speaking tours for Kennedy and Johnson.  Johnson was running for President--no they ran together  Kennedy ran for President and Johnson for Vice President.  Hodges made these speeches all over the state.  I went with him some down in Texas.  The first one he made was down in Atlanta at......club. The next night we were going to be in Dallas     After the speech was over this doctor came up and introduced his staff--and I met him and he said, &quot;I want you to call  this doctor friend of mine in Dallas, I understand that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going to speak tomorrow night-invite him to the meeting if you will--he&#x27;s a good Democrat.&quot;  I said sure and he gave me his name.  When we got down there and got a room, one of the first things I did was to call this guy and invite him to come hear Hodges speech for Kennedy and Johnson.  He said, &quot; I don&#x27;t want to give any short answer Makepeace, but I wouldn&#x27;t walk out my front door th hear anybody talk about that crooked son-of-a-bitch, Lyndon Johnson.  That thing tickled me to death.  We heard some bad things on Lyndon Johnson out in Texas. BB:  A lot said he was a crook. HM:  Crooked as a snake.  You appoint a school teacher to the United States Senate and he becomes a multi-millionaire--that just don&#x27;t happen.  That guy just wasn&#x27;t about to listen to Hodges stumping for himhe couldn&#x27;t stomach that! BB:  You told me earlier about a speech Hodges made to the business men in Washington for the president--would you repeat that please. HM:  I forget the exact problem they were having but being a former Vice-President of Marshall-Fields he knew all these big boys in business throughout the U S and Europe as well.  They wanted &quot;big ge scales?                                        \ prob/.&lt;yi.with big management ba Harold Makepeace                                 -21- business&quot; to be chastised a little bit and that was his duty to do which was very unpopular.  I heard later that some of the business people just couldn&#x27;t believe that Hodges would stand up there and do such a thing. BB:  Chastise for whatwage scales? HM:  No I don&#x27;t know .. .. (prob/./yi.with big management back then... attitude back then almost like it is nowthis Carolina Power and Light Companythat kind of feelingbig business monopolizing everything, etc......I don&#x27;t think the Governor was ever as influential after that. I don&#x27;t think he ever recovered from it. BB:  How long did he serve as Secretary of Commerce? HM:  Four.  He finished with Johnson the term of Kennedy. BB:  Could he have stayed on longer if he had wanted to? HM:  I think he could.  I believe Johnson would have reappointed him. BB:  He had had enough of it. HM:  He had enough.  He figured before he left to take that job how much it would cost him.  He figured it would cost him, out of his pockets in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 thousand dollars a year. BB:  What kind of salary did the position pay? HM;  That I don&#x27;t remember.  Of course I sure it&#x27;s more now.  He had a car and a chauffeur--uhthe biggest character that I met up there in Washington was old Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.  This time we were down in Dallas he was there at the hotel suite of roomshe had a man--smart--as his secretary you know.  He was getting ready to have the press to come up.  The secretary--the man--fixing all of the chairs and he had a desk there.  I asked if it would be all right if I stayed and listened and he said &quot;sure.&quot; So I was looking forward to hearing the exchange back and forth you know--these little old Harold Makepeace                           &#x27;  -22- piss-tail boys coming in with their hats in their hands like servants--you know coming to a great guy like Sam Rayburn.  Old Sam welcomed them and told them how much he appreciated their coming--told them what he wanted to say and when he got through he says, &quot;Boys I really appreciate your coming,&quot; then he went on back to his room.  They didn&#x27;t get any chance to ask any questions.  He said what he wanted to say then gets up.  Hodges can do some of thathe could get rid of people the best I ever seen--I mean people that would come in overstayin their time.  He could handle that thing the best--you almost had to get home and think about it--that your ass was kicked was out of there  without your realizing it. 7 BB:  Everett Jordan seemed to be different. I *) &#x27; L. ^&#x27; HM;  Very take time.  I&#x27;ve seen him fwiwrt hang up on a person just telephone--just hang right up. BB:  Didn&#x27;t they call him the &quot;minuteman&quot; because he was so prompt? HM:  Prompt? Oh...we had a lawyer from here that was going to be appointed judge and was going to be sworn in and Hodges was invited toflthe swearing-in._____________was even late for his funeral when he died a few years ago.  I told___________, &quot;We&#x27;re going to come down there at ten o&#x27;clock when you&#x27;re supposed to be sworn in, and if you are not there, he won&#x27;t be there to swear you in.  I&#x27;m telling you, just like a friend.&quot;  I said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do you like you did me the first time I was ever on a jury, you was the solicitor, there was a big black woman had been cut across her breastgreat bigand it so happened that my chair was right in front of her--I could almost reach oyer and touch--smell her goodness knows.  And he was making this charge and he says, &quot;Now I want you to share with the gentlemen of the jury how you were slashed and mutilated,&quot; And she started opening that Harold Makepeace                                    -23- thing and pulling that thing out and I just turned my head--I didn&#x27;t want to see that black thing--almost sticking in my face.  I just turned my head.  She got it all back and everything--that son-of-a-gun says, &quot;Now I feel that there&#x27;s one member of the jury that failed to observe the mutilation that you had and I&#x27;m afraid that he will be unable to make a just decision--show this to him.&quot;  And he grinned you knowr-and there she pulled that dern thing again.  So I had a mind to pay him back at this swearing-in ceremony. BB:  Was he there on time? HM:  Yes sir!  He was there waiting. Sometimes you didn&#x27;t think he would enjoy what he was doing--but he did.  A lot of his speeches at a school building or someplace--when they would start coming out the front he would go out the back. BB:  Didn&#x27;t he want to see the people? HM:  I think he kind of figured they didn&#x27;t want to see him!!  I think he honestly felt that way sometimes.  It was just his nature........ [End of side 1 tape #3]                                            ;  . ......cocktail party or whatever it might be and it got ten o&#x27;clock ...he went home.  Early riser.  He&#x27;d get up at five o&#x27;clock every morning.  You never saw any papers or anything On his desk in the Governor&#x27;s office.  He&#x27;d get up every morning--the chauffeur would get all the mail and everything--he had a box--carry it to the mansion he&#x27;d get up at five in the morning.  Son-of-a-gun would call me sometimes at five o&#x27;clock in the morning.  He always answered the letters on his...... back in the box, carry it back to his secretary and that was it.  He was tending to businessstate governmentinstead of answering letters....... Harold Makepeace                                 -24- BB: As his secretary, when he was Governor, your primary function was to do what? HM:  Like---lady friends  it came out in the paper--I came home that weekend--saw her at church--she said, &quot;You never did tell me you could write on a typewriter [laughs] private secretary!  I says&#x27; &quot;No I can&#x27;t even take shorthand.&quot;  Then I told her......It was like onetime he left on a trip somewhere and he didn&#x27;t call ________, the Lt. Gov. ......and I got involved in some of that dad blame stuffI just told the Governor to get old Lt. Gov...........listen Luther, &quot;The Governor is going to be gone for a few more days and I&#x27;m snowed under--some things I&#x27;m supposed to be doing  I&#x27;m doing&#x27;-&#x27;-in fact I was in the Governor&#x27;s office.  I said, &quot;I can&#x27;t do it all.  I&#x27;ll send a patrol car up tlhere after you or I&#x27;ll send a plane after you--you won&#x27;t have to do a thing but get in it and come over here and stay a few days.&quot; And do you know that son-of-a-gun woundn&#x27;t do it! BB:  Lt. Gov.? HM:  You take an average person--Lieutenant Governor would have been thereI wouldn&#x27;t have had to send for him.  He would have loved that-coming in and taking charge you see.......trying to get rid of him. He never did come.  Everytime he:ever left or to be gone--he never did come over there. BB HM BB HM He just didn&#x27;t want to do it?  Too busy or what? No he wasn&#x27;t too busy, he was just that type of guy. What did Hodges say to him when he got back, anything? Nothing.  Hodges didn&#x27;t even ask him to come.  I was the one that did the asking. BB:  I know you were the one that had all the work to do.  Did Hodges ever criticize you for anything you did? Harold Makepeace                                 -25- HM:  No [laughs] I&#x27;d tell him to go jump in the water.  No we got along real goodI knew him well enoughwe played golf together-back then I would drive with a three iron--I couldn&#x27;t drive with a wood--one time we been to Pinehurst got back over here to Haw River told the driver to stop.  He said I want you to take that three iron that and I want to throw it right in the middle of/dern river [laughs]. He said, &quot;If I&#x27;d do that then you couldn&#x27;t even hit a ballif you didn&#x27;t have that three iron.&quot; BB;  So you agree that Henry Jordan was a better politician? HM:  I think that Everett, as a fund raiser, was tops.  Everybody can&#x27;t do that. BB:  I wonder why he was so good at it--people he knew or-- HM:  Well people he knew--and he knew all them big shots in the state and they of course, knew him.  That&#x27;s number one and as I say, back then they had a pretty close organization.  The Republican Party just wasn&#x27;t in it.  And the Democratic Party just wouldn&#x27;t give them a chance to stick their heads up out of the water.  It was easy! BB:  The Democrats had all the big money didn&#x27;t they? the Broyhills HM;  Oh sure!  Sure--they almost still have--take__/_____and that group  of course it&#x27;s changing now.  So many of these people are Republicans. You know I remember a lot of people came from Massachusetts and that area way back when they first came down here and I remember an old _______she lived to be ninety some years old--but they were staunch Republicans.  She thought that a Democrat down here--he just wasn&#x27;t anything.  And you know that thing is reversed now?  ...switched ... up there.  Take the average Democrat now--________at Chicago--I&#x27;m not exaggeratinghe had an afternoon cocktail party at a big hotel-elaborate place.  And we went to it--and I&#x27;m telling you the honest Harold Makepeace                                 -26- truthwith the characters that were there--I was afraid to get my back away from the wall!  No kidding--I just never seen people that you looked like that--do/remember the guy that used to wear the dark glasses all the time--they finally ran him out of the&#x27;crooked as a rattlesnake--from New York--he was the top Democrat man and always wore black glasses--nice looking guy. BB:  Wasn&#x27;t Javits was it? HM:  He never was elected office or anything he was these Democrats  just like Everett was to the Democratic Party in North Carolina.  But that was in his heyday--and they had all--you couldn&#x27;twhy the way they had things set up with the type of peoplea decent person couldn&#x27;t get elected in a ward or anyplace to save their neck.  Couldn&#x27;t possibly.                                                                   ,;,/,. BB:  I understand that when Everett JOrdan was Chairman of the Democratic Party he pretty well controlled things.  How did he do this? HM:  Well he was just a top-rated politician.  Organizer. BB:  Did he know all these people in the various counties? HM:  Yeah.  And the newspaper people were with Everett. BB:  Were for Him? HM:  Yeah.  He got good BB:  Except when he got appointed to the Senate? HM:  Why sure then they--they you get--after that but they couldn&#x27;t do anything or control him when he was head of the Democratic party. Back then, patronage was terrific--coming through from the county level right on up to him you see. BB:  If you wanted a job you had to be a democrat. HM:  Right.  You dern right.  See Luther didn&#x27;t do that at all.  He didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the Democratic Chairman in the state or the ones down here.  He figured they didn&#x27;t elect him. Harold Makepeace                                 -27- BB:  Is the patronage not as strong now as it was then? HM:  I think it&#x27;s just a bad.  Look at Huntwhat do you think? He&#x27;s the best politician since Simmons--Senator Simmonshe&#x27;s got the best I didn&#x27;t vote for him; never will vote for him, BB:  What&#x27;s Hunt&#x27;s ambition? HM:  He&#x27;s going to run for Senate.  He&#x27;s awell they said that the most Terry Sanford ever made as a lawyer was $6,000 a year when he was elected Governor--I was told that down in Fayetteville.  See, he didn&#x27;t even go back to his hometown of Laurenburg to practice law you can tell he&#x27;s not sharphe couldn&#x27;t compare with Luther Hodges. This Jim Huntif he hadn&#x27;t got in the Governorship he couldn&#x27;t have made a decent living--he&#x27;d have been farming. BB:  Did he study law? HM:  He&#x27;s a lawyer. BB:  He&#x27;s a great organizer they say. HM:  Oh boy!  He&#x27;s got enough commissionswhat was ithe appointed three people here the other day--Fair Treatment, something--anyway they went to a highway meeting down here in Aberdeen and I thought then--I says, &quot;If those three!* I would love to have gone--I bet they didn&#x27;t open their mouththey wouldn&#x27;t have known what to have said!!  Gee, I- but he&#x27;s got that all over the state.  And another thing; he&#x27;s got some people that Luther Hodges hadbig people!  Just as tied up as this other group--I mean big people. BB HM BB HM BB Committed to him? Yes sir!  They&#x27;re committed to himwhole hog! Harold, there is a limit which you can/to a campaign is there not? Legally?                                                                                   i i        . &quot; &lt; It can be done I&#x27;m sure. Harold Makepeace                                 -28- HM:  Shucks!  I&#x27;ve been called from say a certain place in Durham, &quot;You going to be through Durham any time soon?&quot; I&#x27;d say, &quot;Well yeah, I was planning on coming by there today.&quot; They&#x27;d say, &quot;How about dropping in uh attorneys office up here-in the board room.&quot;  &quot;0. K.&quot;  I&#x27;d go in there and there&#x27;d be an envelope-no address; no return, nothing-hand it to me--well I knew what it was----_------be $10,000; $20,000 whatnot.  The most I ever experienced was $50,000. I know Sougliern Bell that thing isn&#x27;t on is it? [Recorder is turned off]  1   )</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interview with MAXINE SWALIN February 25, 1985 Chapel Hill, North Carolina By Amy Glass Transcribed by Amy Glass Original transcript on deposit at The Southern Historical Collection Louis Round Wilson Library The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina Amy Glass;  The date is February 25th, 1985 and I&#x27;m. at the home of Benjamin and Maxine Swalin.  I&#x27;m about to interview Maxine Swalin on the early days of the North Carolina Symphony and talk with her about her career and her formative years.  I&#x27;d like to start out by asking what it was like to come to Chapel Hill in the 1930s, Maxine Swalin:  We came to Chapel Hill on the railroad, getting off in the station in Durham.  I remember we were met by Dr. and Mrs. Glen Haydn.  And it so happened that my husband was to teach during the second semester at the music department (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).  We were to stay at the Haydn&#x27;s house while they were on vacation in California, and during that time we got acquainted with the &quot;village&quot; life, and it really was a village at that time.  The Stringham s were friends of ours from Mr, Swalin&#x27;s days in New York.  Ed Stringham was a musicologist and had been head of the music department at Queens.  They were our good friends, as well as the Shinhans, Jan Shinhan and his wife.  They lived diagonally across the street. So the Shinhan&#x27;s dog and the Stringham&#x27;s dog were great pals and we had some very good picnics and times together. But during this time, my husband was urging me to go on with graduate studies and assuring me all the time that it would be the very best insurance, during my lifetime.  We felt that if I enrolled in such studies at the music department at Chapel Hill, that it would be very difficult because of social duties . . . A.G.:  ... as the wife of a professor . . . Swalin:  ... to really be enrolled as a student.  So we decided Swalin 2 on an eastern college.  Previously, before doing my undergraduate work at the University of Iowa, I had made visits to various women&#x27;s colleges in the east, for instance Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Radcliffe and Smith.  At Smith I was offered a scholarship, but because of my mother&#x27;s ill health, I stayed in Iowa,  And I always regretted that I didn&#x27;t get my undergraduate work there because I was very spoiled when I went to the University of Iowa.  I missed New York terribly, and also Hartford where I taught for two years after completing the work at Julliard.  So I was an irresponsible student who resisted everything at the University of Iowa.  I was very spoiled. So, I did want to go back (for graduate work) to an eastern college, but it was a great sacrifice because it meant that my husband would have to &quot;be a bachelor&quot; again.  Previously, we had been engaged for six years, with the ocean between us for three and a half of those years, so it was high time that we could stay together.  Anyway, he found a very comfortable place to room and board while I went to Radcliffe.  There, of course, I had a very inspiring time with not only wonderful colleagues, but a very fine faculty.  It was a priviledge to study under such men as Dr. Hugo Leichtentrit,  and Dr. Davidson of the choral department. A.G.:  Were you getting a Master&#x27;s Degree in performance? Arts degree. Swalin: A Master of/ They had no respect at all for performance. It was all composition and study and musicology.  And, of course, I did nothing but apply myself in order to get this work behind me as fast as possible. A.G.: What year would that have been? Swalin: I got my degree in &#x27;36. And the only time my husband and I could be together was at Thanksgiving and at Christmas. We would meet Swalin 3 half way, in Washington or Richmond.  But, I used to see the young faculty wives wheeling their babies out on the park at Radcliffe and Harvard Square and think, &quot;Oh, why am I here?&quot; A.G.:  But, it wasn&#x27;t long before you were out again? Swalin:  Yes.  I actually stayed the following summer and my husband joined me there in Cambridge.  And I was able to study with a famous man by the name of Kinkeldey from the University of Ithica who came there as a musicologist.  So, I was always grateful in the interest he took in showing me how to do original research by taking me down to the files in Widener Library.  Always before the Radcliffe girls would have to go to what we called &quot;the Breakfast Room&quot; in Widener, and we would order our books through a little hole in the door. A.G.:  My goodness,&#x27; Swalin:  So, because we were females in disrespect,     And so it was a thrill and a great enlightenment to me to be able to have access to all of the campus of Harvard.  So I was very grateful for that.  And then we went up to the Green Mountains and hiked the rest of the summer.  We hiked up Mt. Washington.  I remember we weren&#x27;t prepared and I had six layers of summer clothes as we climbed up there and the wind was 60 miles per hour and we had to crawl in order to get into the one hotel up there. But we had a wonderful hiking experience all summer, and then came back here (to Chapel Hill) and were ready to work. I wanted to use the music.  The village of Oxford, forty-two miles away, had no music at all in it&#x27;s schools, so they invited me to open up Monday a department.  I used to get up every/morning at 6:00 o&#x27;clock and drive there.  And I remember that the highway was always being torn up and it was always a grueling trip to get there, in all kinds of weather.  I had Swalin 4 classes from the primary grades up through the high school.  Every class was thirty minutes and I took off thirty minutes for lunch and that endured for two years.  And finally, they gave enough musicals and dramas, and raised      enough   funds for a salary for a full time music teacher. So that was behind me.  Later, I did the choral music at the Chapel Hill High School. But, we never even thought about the North Carolina Symphony or had any contact with it because when we came here in 1935, Lamar String-field was in town just for the day, and somebody said, &quot;There goes the conductor of the North Carolina Symphony.&quot;  And he was in a white cadillac, so I never will forget the sight of the dissappearing white cadillac. A.G.:  Did you ever meet Lamar Stringfield? Swalin:  No, not at that time.  But my husband had known him at Julliard.  So, in 1938, during the war, there was a &quot;Bundles for Britain&quot; concert in Greensboro and my husband used the students from his University Orchestra combined with some of the North Carolina Symphony players who had no activity at the time.  That seemed to excite enough interest, so that a gentleman from Greensboro by the name of Edward B. Benjamin asked us to come for Thanksgiving dinner at his beautiful home.  And, he asked my husband then if he thought he could create, or build a North Carolina Symphony that would be self-supporting. A.G.:  Who was Benjamin? Was he an entrepreneur? Swalin:  Edward B. Benjamin was a philanthropist who lived part of his time in New Orleans where he grew up; his family was a distinguished one there.  Then his wife, Blanche, was the daughter of a distinguished&quot; family b/ the name of Sternberger. Swalin 5 A.G.:  A North Carolina family?  They lived in Greensboro, then? Swalin:  Oh, yes.  Friendly Acres was the name of their estate.  So, through that friendship, my husband was encouraged to inquire of the first president (the only president the N. C. Symphony had had), Dr. Joseph Hyde Pratt, whether or not he thought there was any hope to resuscitate the North Carolina Symphony.  And, by that time, Dr. Pratt lived in Washington.  He was a geologist and had been State Geologist for many years as well as being head of the department here at the University.  So, he encouraged Ben (Mr. Swalin) to see if there were enough players and if there was enough interest and so on, to get started.  I&#x27;ll skip over those early years.  They were one of a great deal of inquiry and discouragement, and not so much encouragement except from a friend in Chapel Hill, Mrs. A. C. Burnham who was a violinist, She came here after her distinguished husband, a medical doctor, had passed away in New York.  She resided in Teney Circle and while I was away at Radcliffe, she was very kind to my husband and had him to dinner often.  Then she started studying violin with him.  So, through her wonderful friendship and encouragement, she knew a lot about the early symphony, as did Adeline McCall, Mrs. Fred B. McCall. A.G.:  Had they been members of the earlier North Carolina Symphony Society? Swalin:  Oh, yes.  They had been some of the very earliest friends of the symphony, and knew Lamar Stringfield very well, of course.  And then, Paul Green.  We depended on him very much.  Paul and Elizabeth became very fine friends who encouraged us.  One time, I think it was the first concert that was given under the name of the North Carolina Symphony again (that was March 16th), at Meredith College in the auditorium there, Swalin 6 a lady attended the concert.  She thought that musically it was quite worthy and she wrote an aritcle in the Raleigh News and Observer, scolding the public for not attending.  So, my husband got in touch with her, and learned that Mrs. Charles E. Johnson was to become a very important supporter of the Symphony.  In fact, she became the first president after it was reorganized. A.G.:  Was it unusual, do you think, for a woman to become president? Swalin:  Well, she was a reticent person and she claimed that she didn&#x27;t know how to preside or do anything that was in a public way, but she really was a very stimulating personal friend and she supervised her meetings very well.  In fact, the most creative thing she did was to introduce us to Governor and Mrs. Broughton. One night, the three of us went to see them in the executive mansion and then posed the idea that the orchestra could eventually, and should, become a state organization, with legislative support.  And, the governor liked the idea and Mrs. Broughton actually went to his office and one by one would call the legislators in and talk to them about this proposal.  And, so the bill actually went through in 1943 as the &quot;Horn Tootin&#x27; Bill.&quot; A.G.:  Do you have any idea of the length of time between that first conversation with the governor and when the bill was passed in &#x27;43? Swalin:  No, I think it was only a few months as far as that&#x27;s concerned. A.G.:  I see.  But, the work that had gone into it up until that point was tremendous. Swalin:  Yes,  And Mrs. Burnham, of course, was a friend of Mrs, Johnson, and the Broughtons and Paul Green. Swalin 7 A.G,:  So, you had spokespeople. Swalin:  We had spokespeople, that&#x27;s right.  So, from that time on, we were     proud to actually be invited to play in some of the communities, such as Kinston, Statesville and Asheville.  And we took the group on tour to, I think, eight concerts that first year which was probably 1944.  So, the idea began to grow that perhaps we could get an orchestra from the state. President Graham (Frank Porter Graham) gave Mr. Swalin an indefinite leave of absence in order to see if he could build a North Carolina Symphony and to see if it was a practical idea.  And so, after ten years of teaching, he did search through the state to see if there were enough string playersthere were always enough wind players, but there had been very little expert teaching in strings in the state at that timewho were available to go on the road.  For instance, there would be housewives, there would be faculty people and so those early concerts, during those early years, were on weekends.  And they were prepared for the concerts by my husband leaving Chapel Hill every Friday afternoon, either driving (rarely could he take the car because there wasn&#x27;t enough gas in those days). So, he would either take the train to Asheville, or take a bus to one of other centers that had &quot;units&quot; for N. C. Symphony players, such as High Point, Charlotte,   Greensboro,    and Raleigh.  Then, during the war, there were so many of the players who were   drafted into the service, that he established a unit in Richmond. He would leave every Sunday morning, at about 7;00, and arrive in Richmond and have a rehearsal that afternoon, and then come back and arrive in Raleigh about 9:00 at night.  So, you see, he was , . . A.G.:  . . . putting it together. Swalin 8 Swalin:  Yes, but previous to the time when he was given indefinite leave to test this out, he was always working with these eleven units in the state, on weekends.  They would rehearse in a gymnasium or in an auditorium in one of the colleges, and they would pool their gasoline and all arrive together and rehearse very hard for a few hours.  And they would eventually get their concerts.  Some of the players were very skilled and very fine.  It was surprising, the quality of the programs in those very early days. A.G.:  Can you explain exactly what you mean by a &quot;unit?&quot; Swalin:  A unit would be combined of all of the professional musicians in the area.  For instance, in Charlotte, there would be Sam Citron, a violist and Bill Green, a cellist and then there would be musician students from Davidson who would come in.  There would be two or three girl honists. Then, in High Point perhaps there would be only a violist and a tympanist. But he would rehearse what he had, and they would rehearse their parts. A.G.:  That&#x27;s incredible.  And then all of those units put together would constitute the symphony? Swalin:  Yes, on several weekends before a concert would be scheduled. A.G.:  That must have been an incredible amount of work and travel. Swalin:  Too much, yes.  I remember we had to furnish night accommodations sometimes when we were too far off home base.  And it was always up to me and to a very good friend who was a student of Ben&#x27;s by the name of here Albin Pikutis.  He came/from DePauw University, where he was a student of Ben&#x27;s,     when Ben transferred to the University of North Carolina.  And so he graduated in violin here and he became an instructor of orchestra in the Durham schools.  But all that time he was very, very loyal and faithful and helped in the arrangements for these players who had to have overnight Swalin 9 accommodations.  Generally this correspondence was carried on by me and I was just as inexpert as I could be in these things, A.G.:  There were no rules for this kind of thing! Swalin:  No.  And after a concert there would be no one to instruct the draymen in loading and unloading, so I would get up on the truck and tell them where to put these instrument cases so they would be safe. I had all kinds of mundane jobs. A.G.:  Well, it sounds more than mundane to me. Swalin:  But, in 1945 the idea became concrete that we should try to open up the state and see if we could get enough support to really tour with a professional orchestra.  And, so my husband and I would go almost constantly on the roadfrom one district or one area to another in order to meet people and give violin and piano recitals, and then .Symphony present the idea of forming a/chapter.  The chapter would then get support through memberships and then bring the orchestra there for a concert. Then, by 1946 we wanted to be able to play for the children as well. And, so the chapters were formed on the basis of having a pair of concerts. The adult concert, with admission through memberships, would make it possible for us to give a free concert for school children.  And, of course, the legislators were especially interested in the early education of students. So we had had auditions for young children who had potentially solo possibilities as early as 1944, I remember.  And little Jane Winfield of Washington (little Washington) came with her monther; she was 12.  She was perhaps one of the first performers to play at children&#x27;s concerts. And, of course, she became a very fine musician and later on in her career married Daniel Ericourt, the very fine pianist of Greensboro who&#x27;s Swalin 10 a specialist in Debussy.  She claims in her brochure that she played with the Symphony 50 times!  And I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it because she became such a cherished soloist that we also presented her at night concerts. Then, of course there was the little granddaughter of Governor Umstead, who played here at a children&#x27;s concert in Chapel Hill, I remember, as early as 1943 or &#x27;44.  And there was Nancy Lassiter of Smithfield, who&#x27;s father had the Smithfield Herald, who later graduated from Duke University.  She was a very fine pianist as well as having an excellent voice.  She is now connected with the staff of the Metropolitan Opera Co. of  NY.  Then other very fine discoveries were Carolyn Taylor or Wadesboro, the granddaughter of the Honorable Taylor and his son (who was another legislator).  She later went to Julliard and came back and played, in her late teens, in night concerts.  Then of course there was Bobby Morris, from Atlantic.  One wonders, you know, with these children coming from little towns, how it was possible for them to show such expertise. Morris now teaches at Morehead City. A.G.:  Were these soloists generally pianists? Swalin:  These were pianists, that&#x27;s right.  We didn&#x27;t open up the auditions to vocalists because it didn&#x27;t seem that their voice would be matured.  Anyway, the auditions were opened up (I think in 1946) to adult vocalists, violinists, cellists and pianists.  It was always difficult for us to arrange for a piano soloist at night because there were so few good pianos, and it was so expensive to have a large grand moved from a large city.  So there were more cellists and violinists and singers than others. [END TAPE I, SIDE I] Swalin 11 A.G.:  I&#x27;d like to back up a little bit and ask you if you can remember where and when the idea of the children&#x27;s concerts first came about, or first came into your or your husband&#x27;s mind? Swalin:  Yes.  My husband was always interested in the early training in the arts for children.  And I think that the possibilities were open to him, not only when he played with the Minneapolis Symphony, but also when he was in Russia and went to the public parks for culture and saw the wonderful concerts and plays that children were exposed to.  And, so as early as 1944, we were having very few concertsbut actually travelling to the extreme parts of the state.  For instance, we had a chamber group that went to Cullowhee for an engagement and we stopped in Asheville in order to give a children&#x27;s concert.  This was in a movie theatre.  And, of course, it was not ideal at all.  The environment was wrong, it was dark, and it had a small stage, and, you see, we couldn&#x27;t present anything with a sort of spectacular lighting thatiwould be necessary.  Anyway, we noticed that what we played was not the right thing for children; they were restive.  And, I remember going to children&#x27;s concerts at Carnegie Hall when I was at Julliard, and I used to seeup in the balconysome boys would be having fist fights. And once or twice I would separate them, and this would be during the time when Serkin would be playing brilliantly, you know, and the orchestra would be performing meticulously, perfectly.  And yet, these inattentive children were having a fight. So I learned then that the attention span was very fleeting and one had to measure it and know what to present, aAd how to contrast the moods and the elements and how to break up what was presented.  So we learned that what we were doing there, at Asheville at this trial run, was wrong. Swalin 12 So, we got in touch with Adeline McCall, who was the supervisor of music in the Chapel Hill schools.  She was an expert in music for early childhood, and knew what was successful and what wasn&#x27;t so far as the small ears, the listening ears, was concerned.  And, so we started to work together.  The idea was to contact the schools, through the superintendents and the teachers, and to mail the program in advance.  Then Mrs. McCall had, what she called &quot;Symphony Stories,&quot; and she had the theme of the things we were to play.  And, on the back leaf of the little Symphony Stories, which the children bought through the schools for 10 cents, they learned not only how to read rhythm by using their tambourines and their little percussive instruments, but to listen and also to march and to dance and to fingerpaint and to interpret the music. A.G.:  So they were incorporating all the different skills. Swalin:  Incorporating, yes.  So there was a correlation of the spirit of music with what they put on paper in paint, what they molded in clay, what they wove in straw.  And Symphony Day became a flag day.  When we would arrive, sometimes there would be practice cheers, you know.  And I remember arriving at Elizabethtown one time and the bus carrying the Little Symphony Players drove up the back part of the school there.  The little Boy Scouts were on a cinder mold and they were all ready for us and they gave some kind of a &quot;rah-rah&quot; cheer.  And then they were thrilled at being given the privHedge of carrying the big drums in.  The little Girl Scouts were at the doorway, telling us where to go to remove our wraps and so on.  And one little girl who approached me asked if I would like to go to the lingerie room.  And then after the concert, of course, we were given a wonderful chicken lunch by the home economics department. So, that&#x27;s the kind of cordial welcome that we generally had in these Swalin 13 schools.  And it was thrilling to be able to return year after year to the same communities, to the same rural, consolidated schools and know that these children were being bussed in.  Those that were in the third grade for the first year, would get to hear the orchestra at least for three more years or maybe four, through the sixth or seventh grade.  So, of course, Mr. Swalin meets people on the street and in cafes and so on who stop him and say, &quot;I was in the fifth grade in Roxboro when you came there,&quot; and so on.  So, it evidently has meant quite a bit. A.G.:  To travel the great distances that you had to, would you do that all at a certain time during the year so that the Symphony members could take a certain amount of time off from their other responsibilities? Swalin: Yes. The most difficult time was from January until mid-April, when we travelled with one Little Symphony. And it was so difficult to get string players who were free to be away that long. As I explained, housewives and faculty wives couldn&#x27;t do it. So Mr. Swalin would go to New York, Boston, Baltimore and to Chicago and audition people. Then we would travel with 26 players, and sometimes we never got back to Chapel Hill until the end of the tour because we were booked up to solidly and away all the time. I can remember getting back at the end of a Little Symphony tour, going to the post office, and I had to stand out in front of the post office to figure out which was the way home!  I&#x27;d been away so long. But it was a very exhilarating time because of the wonderful friends in all these communities.  Sometimes they didn&#x27;t always understand. For instance, at Morehead City we would stay at the Jefferson Hotel and people from the nearby military base would say, &quot;Well, why can&#x27;t the players come over here and play on Saturday.  You&#x27;re not doing anything Swalin 14 on Saturday.&quot; A.G.:  You were in demand. Swalin:  Yes, that&#x27;s right.  And then of course I can remember up in Franklin, it was such a hospitable community.  And the first time we went there we played in a tabernacle with a sawdust floor.  Of course, there were not enough busses in Macon County to bring all the children from Tryon and from those remote mountain places to the concert in so some children traveled  in trucks. Franklin/ And that&#x27;s where this first concert was given.  There was a big bellied stove in the center of the room with the longest, red hot stove pipe I have ever seen.  And the platform was up near the stove and of course, the oboists were concerned that their instruments would crack. But still it was so cold that some of the players wore gloves.  The contrast with the heat and the cold was terrific in some of the places those days. And then, of course, the same situation with a long pipe from a fat bellied stove was at Hatteras when we went out there to play. The parents brought their babies and their young children over to the concert in the afternoon at Hatteras from Ocracoke. They came in a boat from Ocracoke. Then, of course, we had such an exciting time there. They had a square dance at night and then the Coast Guard took us on rides down the dunes, so that was a memorable time.  One time we were ......  ........ ......&#x27;.......  Swalin 15 so exhausted after the complete tour that Mrs. Harry McMullan, the wife of the Attorney General, said, &quot;We have a house on Cape Hatteras, and here&#x27;s the key.  Go down there and rest.&quot;  So we went, with Albin Pikutis. And I remember I could hardly wait to get my bathing suit on and when I did, I felt these sharp punches in my rear.  And the Sound was just full of these king crabs, and of course, I never went back after that. But we were to have gone to Ocracoke years later, and it was such a colorful prospect that a photographer from Life magazine came and met us at the Jefferson Hotel in Morehead City.  But, a storm came up as we were leaving Campbell College and we had to slide on the ice until we got to Jefferson Hotel.  The storm didn&#x27;t abate the next day and they telephoned from Ocracoke and said they had no heat in the hotel, and the ferry was not running.  And so that colorful experience was cancelled. I remember the photographer left for Washington that Sunday afternoon to take over an assignment with President Truman, so it was in that period you see. Of course, there were other colorful concerts.  We always played at hospitals, for instance at Morganton and at Kinston.  Then one time we played at the state prison in Raleigh.  The news that evening, since we were to play for the legislators that evening, said &quot;the orchestra plays for the law breakers in the afternoon and the law makers at night.&quot; A.G.:  You did House Chamber &quot;Thank you&quot; concerts.  What was that like?  Did you actually play in the legislature? Swalin: Yes, in the cramped quarters of the capitol. And Mr. Swalin not only believes so thoroughly in bringing good music to children, but to high school students who were in outstandingly fine choral groups.  For Swalin 16 instance there was a very good group at High Point and also one at Durham. So those two choral groups were joined together and we did some choruses from Mendelsohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah,&quot; for the legislature.  And how they stood close I together!  And we got the orchestra down at the lowest level and then these singers were up behind the pillars.  But, anyway, those were historic concerts and, I think, convinced the legislators that the support of the Symphony was a very fine subsidy for them, you see. And, of course, Mr. Swalin was always trying to plan (with his influential trustees) for the next bicentennial presentation. &#x27; Sometimes I would take the most colorful paintings from some of the children, and we actually had a tape of their singing.  So we tried to make these presentations in a colorful, interesting way so that the legislators would get a sense of what the school children were getting. A.G.:  Great.  I also read that when the literature was chosen for the Symphony to play, literature was chosen that was available for the schools and the children could learn it beforehand.  How was that done? Swalin:  Always, yes.  It was my responsibility to correspond with all the schools in the state before our tour started.  And we would not only send the material for the teachers (that Mrs. McCall prepared) &quot;How to Get Ready for the N.C. Symphony Concert,&quot; but we would send pounds and pounds of these Symphony Stories after we received an order from the schools.  And the children would bring their dimes and get their little Symphony Stories and they would have them there, not only for the music teacher to prepare, but sometimes in these communities there was no music teacher.  So the grade teachers would do their best to read the biographies of the composers and then on the little flutophones they would play the themes, then they would dance with the records that we mailed them Swalin 17 in advance.  And, of course, it was very difficult to plan these programs because we had to know what records would be available in quantity, and also what would be available economically for the schools.  And very often their library of recordings consisited only of what they bought from the Symphony.  And, of course, we did all of this gratis; we never made any money from it.  Anyway they had to pay for the postage.  But it was a large bookkeeping assignment to do all of this correspondence in advance. A.G.:  Was there an administrative office for the Symphony? Swalin:  Oh, yes.  The first one was in a little room on Columbia Street, behind what is now a restaurant on the corner of Columbia and Franklin.  Let&#x27;s see, what is that now? Oh, yes, it&#x27;s a beer joint! William&#x27;s, I think it was.  We had no heat and we had no  accommodations, no water, so we used to borrow water by going over to the town hall which was diagonally across the street. A.G.:  How far we&#x27;ve come from those days! Swalin:  Yes, and we had a little coal stove.  And Paul Green was successful in getting Dr. Frank Porter Graham to cooperate with us in allowing a leave of absence to J.  0. Bailey.  He was an excellent English teacher, and he came to us in this first office with a gel machine and one typewriter (on which he typed with two fingers).  We got out all the letters in preparation and organized the whole state into, I think, eleven districts.  And we were fortunate, after having given these piano and violin recitals and meeting up with such fine friends, in having a chairman for each of the districts, you see.  For instance, Mr. G. K. McClure, of Asheville, who had established the Farmers Federation of Western Swalin 18 Carolina, was our very competent supervisor of all the western counties. And he actually employed a wonderful fund raiser, by the name of Virginia Dameron, to travel about and get these communities such as Troy, Franklin, Cashiers, Murphy and Cullowhee and so on to bring the Symphony there. And then another fine supervisor was L. C. Gifford, who was editor of the Hickory newspaper.  He was so energetic also in organizing that Piedmont area.  So we really had a successful, 1946, first state-wide tour. And, I remember such very fine players who got leave of absences from their colleges and who dropped their studies in order to go with the Symphony,  For instance, May Jo Perky (May Jo DeNardo), who was a violin student of Ben&#x27;s and taught afterwards in Asheville, got a leave of absence and came with us on tour as the concertmaster.  And just to show what a wonderful talent she was, she played the Grieg Piano Concerto with us eight times during that first tour. A.G.:  She played the piano? Swalin:   Yes, she was the piano soloist as well as concert master. A.G.:  Incredible. Swalin:  So we had some very fine people. A.G.:  Mainly they were faculty and students from the University of North Carolina system? Swalin:  Well, yes, in addition to those who came from New York and Chicago and so on. A.G.:  I suppose over the years, more and more players came from outside of the state.  Would that be fair to say? Swalin:  Well, yes.  For instance, you see, this Little Symphony Swalin 19 Tour extended only until mid-April and then we would meet up with very, very fine professional musicians from the National, from the Minnesota (the Minneapolis, it&#x27;s now called Minnesota), from the Baltimore, from the San Antonio.  Some of those players were through with their season, and so they came in. A.G.:  Oh.  Then your season came at the end of theirs. Swalin:  Yes, this extended their professional year.  And so some of these distinguished are, for instance, the first flutist of the Chicago Symphony was with us, and the first tubist of the New York Philharmonic was one of those players, and some of the very fine double bassists were with the San Antonio.  So we had an excellent, just an excellent, superior musical group.  And I don&#x27;t think people realize what a treasure we had in those early years.  Of course, we have many, many tapes, but they were made live on the stage without ideal acoustics.  We still have those tapes which we still listen to occasionally. And, of course, another fine tribute was that the Orchestras of the Nation invited us to broadcast and this was a Sunday afternoon nation-wide broadcast that was picked up in Asheville, I remember, one of the times. Then CBS sent a person to Banner Elk to tape a concert of children there and of course, that was one of our treasures, because the children were so ecstatic.  They seemed to live all the year for the time when the Symphony would arrive.  And James Fawcett was the commentator who came, and he arrived a day early at Banner Elk.  He explained, over this nationally broadcast tape that he stopped at the drug store.  He explained that there was a general store, a drug store and there was one stop light that didn&#x27;t light, and so he went over to the orphanage and he was so intrigued with Swalin 20 the wonderful drawled mountain speech of not only the children who were the orphans there, but of the house mother.  So he later told us that when he took that tape back to New York, that the engineers measured some of the vowels.  And I remember after a children&#x27;s concert we had to go somewhere, and so we went next door to the wonderful residence of a widow lady who had five children.  And the oboist would go with us and we would rest, and she would take the littlest boy on her lap and have him read out of a primer.  And I remember she was from Chicago and she was so intrigued by his reading, &quot;Betty caught the bus.&quot; [Read with a drawl] Then that night we would play at Lee&#x27;s McRae   College and all the mountain women would bring in their beautiful cakes, with exciting greetings on top of the cakes in frosting.  Then they had fresh cranberry juice.  So, that mountain concert we always looked forward to, not only because of the students, but because of the mountain folks who would come in. Then I can remember we would travel in mid winter, and sometimes we would curl around those mountain curves and we would look down on a Christmas card scene, you know, the snow everywhere.  And you could see the house down below where you wound around. A.G.:  I know the type of place, I&#x27;ve been there. [END OF INTERVIEW]</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Architect and politician Harvey Gantt describes his ascent from a childhood in segregated Charleston, SC, to becoming the first black mayor of Charlotte, NC. Along the way, Gantt led sit-ins in Charleston, integrated Clemson University, and became a successful architect in Charlotte. While he describes his career path, Gantt discusses civil rights in the American South. As a southerner, he sees the accomplishments of the civil rights movement as dramatic; as a member of the black middle class, he leans toward negotiation rather than revolt. After the movement&#x27;s major successes, while northern activists were pushing for more change, Gantt was seeking to take advantage of his new opportunities. He sees his success both resulting from and contributing to civil rights for African Americans.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  LYNN HAESSLY: This is Lynn Haessly. It is January 6, 1986, and I&#x27;ll be interviewing Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt in his city hall office. As I explained, I&#x27;d like to talk to you about your life beginning with your childhood and your family background. Can you tell me about where you were born and your family?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, I was born in Charleston County, on one of the islands surrounding Charleston, Young&#x27;s Island to be exact. My family, my mother and father, were very young��my father was twenty-one, my mother was eighteen. We moved immediately to Charleston when I was an infant. I lived in public housing in the City of Charleston then, as opposed to the county. My father got a job working in the war industries. At that time, Charleston was a big naval base; it still is. For the first four years of my life I lived in public housing. Then my father decided to move out of public housing as things got better for him and he got a leg up on the economic ladder. And as the war wound down, we moved to the center of Charleston in our own house. Probably I got my first interest in architecture by remembering that he built the house himself and started off and the house sort of grew with our family. I ultimately had four sisters, me being the oldest in the family. I went to public schools; first went out to a kindergarten school that I remember very vividly because I somehow didn&#x27;t like the idea of going to school and the teacher was rather mean. But I went to public school and never went to first grade—I always remember that, I never was a first grader. I went from kindergarten to second grade.  LYNN HAESSLY: Why was that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, because the first day or two that they put me in first grade they found that I had done so well in kindergarten that there was no point in keeping me there and so they put me in second grade. My mother was very pleased about that.  LYNN HAESSLY: You were a high achiever from early on.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I didn&#x27;t call it a high achiever then but, yes, I guess you could say that. I remember her being so very happy about me going into second grade after only about two days in school. But apparently they tested me, I don&#x27;t remember the test, and I moved to second grade.  LYNN HAESSLY: Let me turn you back and ask you about your family background a little more. Had your family&#x27;s families lived in the sea islands off Charleston? Is that where they had come from?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes, they all came from Young&#x27;s Island. My mother&#x27;s family, as far back as they can remember, and my father&#x27;s family came from two different sections of the island. My father came the Adams Run area of Young&#x27;s Island and my mother came from the Oakville area of Young&#x27;s Island. She was an only child but my father came from a big family of Gantts that were there. I would assume, you know, we got into this thing with Alex Haley, but we assume that there must have been some Gantts that owned a plantation or something in that area maybe a couple of generations or more back. My father&#x27;s father had considerable landholdings, or at least it was considered amongst the folks in that area to be fairly large.  LYNN HAESSLY: Do you know how he acquired that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I think he was given it, or at least earned it in some fashion. As a matter of fact, this last July 4th, we all took a sort of historical tour of the family holdings and went back into some deep sections of the islands to see land that was still being held by our family and had been passed on.  LYNN HAESSLY: Had you visited the island regularly as a child to visit relatives?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Oh, yes. I visited my grandmother; it was a yearly trip that my sisters and I would go and spend the summer or at least two or three weeks of the summer where my father grew up. Very few trips to my maternal grandfather&#x27;s home. He had a rather small farm and he died when I was about eleven years old. We spent most of our time with my paternal grandmother&#x27;s homeplace. And so we got an appreciation for the rural life of South Carolina. We were always kidded as being the city kids because my father&#x27;s brothers and children, our cousins, all grew up in the country so to speak.  LYNN HAESSLY: So your forebears were farm owners rather than tenants on Young&#x27;s Island?  HARVEY B. GANTT: That&#x27;s right.  LYNN HAESSLY: One question I had wanted to ask you was to kind of characterize your family&#x27;s social and economic status when you were growing up.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, I would have to say that my folks were economically the lower, lower income family, what I call salt of the earth working people, not a lot of frills, a great deal of love and attention of course to their children, and a great deal of belief in America as the land of opportunity if you work hard and you get an education. We had a high degree of emphasis on education. So we were middle class in concept. You know, we believed in the country and believed in those goals of the middle class that I think is the stuff that America is probably made of, which is a certain degree of education to gain a certain level of material acquisition to live comfortably and of course to do the same thing over and over again with your children. My father worked two or three jobs. In retrospect, probably at relatively low wages except in the latter parts of my stay at home he started to move up the ladder in the naval shipyard.  LYNN HAESSLY: What kinds of different jobs did he have?  HARVEY B. GANTT: He would do a little carpentry work on the side because he had taught himself carpentry when he built our house, so he would assist a small contractor on weekends. Oftentimes he held a job picking up dry cleaning for a dry cleaners. Things that you could do on the weekend. His most stable job, obviously, was the one he had working as a rigger mechanic at the navy yard, and as I started to say, he did generally that kind of laborious work for quite a few years until the latter part of my stay at home, which was when I was about sixteen or seventeen years old. He started to move up in the ranks to supervisor, etc., and I would say most of the years away from home before he retired he had entered some kind of supervisory position within the same group of people, where the physical work was not nearly as intense.  LYNN HAESSLY: Was your mother employed?  HARVEY B. GANTT: My mother was a housewife for all of our time. We have these strong standards about women. My father had a strong feeling for the fact that with five children that my mother needed to be home with them. It&#x27;s a value that I sort of carry, I&#x27;m kind of old-fashioned about that. I still feel very strongly about children coming home from school because when I used to come home from school, beginning as a little kid in kindergarten, the first thing I&#x27;d say when I hit the door was &quot;Mama&quot; and she would answer back and it was so reassuring to me. I didn&#x27;t realize it was reassuring until later years looking back on it. And that really happened all the way through high school. I&#x27;d come home, whether it was from a football game or football practice or senior high club meeting or something and holler out that same &quot;Mama.&quot; She was always home and I always tell the story about my father. The role of a father I think I probably emulate from the way my father treated us. He was never a pal to me and I was an only boy. You know, he didn&#x27;t try to get out and play Little League baseball with me, occasionally he&#x27;d come to the games when I played football in high school and they would come as a family to the game. But he didn&#x27;t get very gung ho and never tried to be a pal; he was always there, sort of reassuring. He would always be stern on discipline at the appropriate times. But he was a great talker about the weightier issues of the time, politics, etc., and it really is in my father that I got more of the inspiration to enter the world of politics first as a pioneer involved in other kinds of activities during the civil rights era. My mother, on the other hand, was always there. So it is in the little but important things about life that value transmissions occurred with my mother. My father was, for example, a very religious man but my mother said, &quot;yes, your dad believes in God, I do too, but you shall study your homework and you shall put two hours of work into that because that is how you are going ultimately to be successful as an architect one day,&quot; and so forth and so on.  LYNN HAESSLY: How young were you when you first realized that you wanted to be an architect?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I&#x27;m one of those fortunate people who early on recognized that I wanted to be an architect and that was in ninth grade. I consider that to be early, I mean, you toy around with a lot of things and I did probably as most kids do, wanting to be everything from a pharmacist to a doctor to a preacher to a lawyer. But finally it was putting together my aptitude for drawing and my interest in the technical aspects of putting things together that led me to architecture.  LYNN HAESSLY: What church did you go to?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I attended Morris Street Baptist Church with my family. I literally grew up in that church. My father and mother came from the island and they were members of a small Baptist church that we revisited this summer also. They came right in and settled into that church and that&#x27;s the only church that our family has known. They were both very active in it and we grew up in it literally to speak, you know, being members of the choir and the Boy Scouts and all the central things I think you go do there.  LYNN HAESSLY: What do you remember about drawing and what kinds of things did you do mechanically?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, I first of all remember about third grade one of my teachers noticed that I doodled in my pad quite a bit, and I would try to draw the prettiest girl in the class. She thought she would take that stray energy that was always doodling and drawing and get me to draw the Christmas scene or the Thanksgiving scene or the pumpkin and horn, etc. And I would do right well at it. She&#x27;d tell other teachers that &quot;he can draw,&quot; you know, &quot;let him draw this.&quot; I did that all the way through elementary school and people started to know me as a person who really could sketch very well. As I look back on it they weren&#x27;t all that good in terms of sketches but they were probably better than most of the kids could draw. And I stuck to doing that. I did that all the way through high school for my own edification, just sketches, just drawing things that I saw and I do it even in city council meetings when I&#x27;m sitting down, just drawing things—doodling.  LYNN HAESSLY: But you were rewarded for it early on, too, at least teachers recognized.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, they recognized the talent there and I guess by their pushing it, it gave me confidence. It was pulled out of me more so. My mother was concerned. She didn&#x27;t want me to be an artist. She thought that that wasn&#x27;t really a stable enough career. As I said, she was a very practical person who looked at things that way. So when I landed on architecture, it seemed to be the perfect blend. It seemed to make sense, too.  LYNN HAESSLY: Can you talk a little about the social atmosphere in Charleston in the &#x27;50s when you were growing up?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Changing! You know, for the first ten years of my life I paid no attention to it. The things that happened around me were accepted. From our little house that my father built, I would walk past an elementary school—I mean, I&#x27;d walk up to the corner and I&#x27;d look to my left and there was a white elementary school, but I would turn to my right and go four or five blocks to a black elementary school. But they looked no different in my opinion and I thought nothing of it except that that&#x27;s the way things were. If my mother took us on Saturdays shopping, we got on the bus, we as young kids would go to the back of the bus and we wouldn&#x27;t question that too much at all. When we got to water fountains, we were taught early on that you drank from the colored fountain because white folks drank from the other one. So in other words, the world was made up a certain way. We lived generally in an integrated neighborhood. It was very strange. There were white people nearby and numbers of cases on the playgrounds without sanction we&#x27;d end up playing together. The law, we later found out, did not really allow that but kids would do it anyway, basketball …  LYNN HAESSLY: Charleston is a city of alleys, isn&#x27;t it?  HARVEY B. GANTT: No, really it&#x27;s a city where servants lived closer to the bigger houses and then they live along the alleys. Traditionally that&#x27;s the way it is, not the alleys, of course, are just as expensive, in fact chic, in terms of having higher income units, or high income units. In the old days, the way the city was laid out, is you had the big houses around the Battery and lots of little, small alleys that were servants&#x27; quarters. That&#x27;s how you got the kind of pattern of integration that occurred in many of the Southern cities like New Orleans and Charleston and Mobile. At any rate, at that time we lived not in that older section of Charleston and so most of the streets were standard little streets. You know, my world was colored by the drugstore around the corner, the street became a playground for us where we played football and stickball in the street, and the neighbors who lived around me, it was a very circumscribed world but it was very comfortable. I never felt &quot;disadvantaged&quot;, which is a new word in the lexicon of the language that came in the late &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. Comfortable, love, secure.  LYNN HAESSLY: How would you characterize the education you got in elementary and in high school?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Excellent. I always have said that. I mean, I didn&#x27;t know that the bad books or the books that were out of date were out of date. And I thought people were generally interested in me and my classmates and they wanted us to do well. There was a great deal of competition to do well, to achieve excellence, a lot of pushing about education. My folks were very much involved with the PTA and other people that were around me were involved. We were all relatively low income folks as it was. I don&#x27;t want to use that term &quot;low income.&quot; We were all salt of the earth kind of average, lower income Americans who had jobs.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did you have jobs when you were in high school?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes. I did the traditional: carried the paper, a black newspaper that I carried.  LYNN HAESSLY: What was the name of it?  HARVEY B. GANTT: The Baltimore Afro-American, it&#x27;s still there. As a matter of fact, I remember I used to sell the paper for fifteen cents, got four cents for each paper I sold and, God, it seemed like a lot of money in those days. And after you sold forty papers you got four times forty which was a dollar sixty cents. It was a big deal. I graduated up from that to working as a delivery boy at a drugstore and I did that in my junior high school years. And then I graduated up from that to working in a supermarket on weekends. I guess that&#x27;s ultimately the last job I had before I graduated from high school. In the last couple of years, I was involved in athletics.  LYNN HAESSLY: What sports?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Football. Can&#x27;t you guess? Let me go back to the social thing a minute because I said it was changing. It was comfortable up until year eleven. It changed dramatically for me with the Supreme Court decision in 1954. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in 1954 was a watershed year in my whole life. I was about eleven years old and had become an avid reader. A couple years earlier I found this small branch library in the black community and teachers would encourage me to go there and to read. I started reading little boy&#x27;s type novels about baseball, football, some short stories. And I started reading everything that I could get my hands on. But when this happened I started to get curious about the whole thing about segregation and why it was unconstitutional. And then I started to see our society in a different light, blacks, whites, and why we do things. Wow, there were actually people who questioned that! I never questioned it before and then I started.  LYNN HAESSLY: When your father talked about politics, were civil rights one of the things that he talked about even before Brown?  HARVEY B. GANTT: He was talking about it before but he talked about it primarily with my mother then. When I started asking questions it became more of a topic of conversation at the dinner table, as it started to become a topic of conversation at everybody&#x27;s dinner table, I suppose. And I just voraciously consumed everything I could find. I read novels, news magazines, and he reinforced a lot of it. He himself was a member of the NAACP so I was very proud of my father for having the courage back then to be a member of that organization as I found out more about it. It finally manifested itself in the fact that he led an effort of parents to get the use of the white high school stadium because ours was in such bad shape. It was very dramatic to see him and other parents get together and cause a change to occur. So it was probably my family&#x27;s first direct encounter with politics and , doing something about a problem. They had been active in the PTA and so it was almost natural for them to continue to be active. And their son was a quarterback on the football team, so they were that much involved in it. But it also was the thing that allowed me��that occurred in 1957—that by the early part of 1960 as I was senior, that&#x27;s when the sit-in started to occur and so I led. I had to act on my own conscience then about the system and had been sufficiently radicalized enough that I thought we ought to do something. I later on with a few other students led a sit-in demonstration which caused us to go to jail.  LYNN HAESSLY: Tell me about that.  HARVEY B. GANTT: We sat down at S. H. Kress&#x27;s lunch counter, after planning to do so for about three or four weeks in selecting our students very carefully, about twenty-three of us. All of us seniors in high school, about to graduate, one April day in 1960, one month before graduation. Our parents were fit to be tied. We couldn&#x27;t tell them about it. But we felt very strongly. I guess we were caught in that whole thing as it spread across the across the country. This wasn&#x27;t right; it seemed ridiculous now that you really examined it.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did you have any organizational support for that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: We were all youth members of the NAACP. But the whole effort was kind of an adjunct thing that was done in secrecy. We didn&#x27;t want any and everybody to be a part of it. We started reading about Martin Luther King and non-violence and we were concerned that we got people who were not hot-headed because they would be a liability and all kinds of complications to occur. We didn&#x27;t want any violence beyond whatever was necessary. We trained ourselves to resist the ridicule we would experience. What we were doing was developing statements on a lot of things that we&#x27;d read. We didn&#x27;t get any of the national leaders to come down to give us any advice. In fact, they would not likely pay much attention to Charleston. Most of the action was occurring on big college campuses in North Carolina and other places.  LYNN HAESSLY: Yes. I think it was unusual for high school students to have taken the initiative.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Very unusual.  LYNN HAESSLY: Why?  HARVEY B. GANTT: We were the only high school at that time when we got involved.  LYNN HAESSLY: Why do you think that was?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Primarily because parental sanctions wouldn&#x27;t allow it anyway, and we decided if we were going to do it we couldn&#x27;t tell our parents.  LYNN HAESSLY: Is there not a black university in Charleston?  HARVEY B. GANTT: There is none. That was probably one of the other reasons is that it would never occur here, that it never would come to a head, and we felt that if thing were going to happen, the kind of negotiations they had gotten into in Greensboro to bring about some changes, you had to do something to make it happen because to do something. This class that graduated in 1960 is a pretty unusual class, too. I think a lot of those people have gone on to be fairly well known in their field and so we had an unusual crop of leaders, I think, at that time.  LYNN HAESSLY: Who were some of the other people who led the sit-in?  HARVEY B. GANTT: James Blake who is now a Methodist minister in Charleston, who is doing quite well and probably will be a bishop in his church pretty soon. Myself. Cornelius Flood who is down at the University of Georgia working on a Ph.D. and working as a chief tutor of the entire athletic program at that school. Some of the names fade. Some of the members of that class: Dr. Deland Merriweather who is doing research in tropical Africa right now, used to be a well-known runner. The remarkable thing about him was that he became a sprint runner world-class well after people had given it up and he picked it up in his late twenties and early thirties and became a star featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. A lot of people are doing very in their professions today.  LYNN HAESSLY: And it was the boys rather than girls?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, there were women but the men led that actually. Anyway, that happened and it turned out to be a positive result. We were not locked up in a jail, we were kept in a courtroom. My parents came to pick us up. The City of Charleston acted in a very civil manner. We were charged and our case ultimately ended up in the Supreme Court which was thrown out. This was a couple years later, I was on my way to Clemson.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did it permanently change the segregation at the lunch counter?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Oh, it started a change in the minds of the whole place. It ultimately ended up in a movement that spread throughout all of Charleston. That occurred two years later, three years later. The year I went to Clemson, one of the same people, the young minister that led a movement called the Charleston Movement, which was massive demonstrations a la the Birmingham type things that occurred for public accommodations, not just lunch counters, but the whole works. That ultimately culminated in a large number of people who wanted to march on Washington and the North. I think all across the South those changes occurred during that year and the following year. But the sit-ins were the first, the very first, time this had ever happened.  LYNN HAESSLY: When you began to think of going to college, what colleges did you pick out and apply to?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, there were two ways I looked at that. In the circumscribed world of segregation, there was Howard and Tuskeegee and A. &amp; T.  LYNN HAESSLY: North Carolina A. &amp; T.?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes. I never applied to them. I only applied to Howard. But I had made a decision already, being into what I thought America was going to be all about in the future—that is an integrated world—I had already made a decision that I was going to go somewhere to get an integrated education. In other words, I wanted to be in a school where I was taught by black and white professors, etc., because architecture is practiced mainly by whites and I thought that you needed to be in an environment where I got that kind of teaching, or at least integrated teaching. I was a National Achievement Scholar out of high school and that meant that I had some scholarship to any school that I could get accepted to. Howard, and I applied to Iowa State, and Ohio State, and a few others, I don&#x27;t remember all of them. And decided ultimately, I think I got accepted to all of them, the Ivy League schools were beyond question for me, I got accepted at Iowa State, thought that that would be a great place to go. It was in the midwest, in the middle of the country, in middle America. I got out there and didn&#x27;t like it.  LYNN HAESSLY: How many black students were there?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Not many. In fact, there weren&#x27;t many blacks anywhere. And that was a culture shock for me; it was really a considerably different place than I had thought it would be. I was mesmerized by the big-time college football and seeing so many black athletes and assuming that the schools were a lot more integrated than they were and made it complicated to find out. Very few blacks matriculated at those universities and those that did were primarily athletes. As a matter of fact, in the first couple of days I was there standing in the registration line, everybody assumed that I was playing on the football team, which insulted me and was degrading.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  LYNN HAESSLY: Had you considered going to college on a football scholarship?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I had a scholarship at a small school in South Carolina, Claflin College. My high school coach was a graduate of that school. But, no, I wasn&#x27;t that good, really, to consider myself for anything more. Our high school team did play in two state championship games and I love football a lot, but not enough to sacrifice architecture which required a lot of afternoon laboratories, which is precisely the time you play football. When I got to Iowa, I used to go occasionally and look at the football practice primarily because I&#x27;d gotten so used to playing football in high school during the fall of a year. As I watched the people play I felt I could play with them but it was just not in the cards. And my mother would have had a fit had I not stuck with architecture. That turned out to be the best decision.  LYNN HAESSLY: When did you begin thinking of transferring and what schools did you consider transferring to?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I only considered one school and it was for the reason that I didn&#x27;t like the cold weather and as I got more and more into it I found that Clemson had a pretty good school of architecture. Things just came to some logical conclusions as they do in my life. I mean, there are times when truth itself sort of snaps its head straight up in my face and you know that you&#x27;ve got to go in a different direction. It&#x27;s like that period when I was politicized by the segregation decision, which was another kind of milestone that said, &quot;it makes no sense for you. If you are lonely out here in the midwest which is hostile to your upbringing in terms of climate and being close to people you know, etc, you ought to be home. That&#x27;s where you ought to go.&quot; And it was nice to make that decision on a twenty-three below zero day in Iowa.  LYNN HAESSLY: You must have known that Clemson, even though it was close to home, would be even more all white and culturally different from your upbringing than Iowa State was then. What were your thoughts about that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, as a matter of fact, Clemson turned out to be blacker. The great surprise was the day that I went up to register amidst the hullabaloo of all the news and press people. Once that was over, I remember going to my room, getting a clue of what the world was going to be like seeing a janitor in the corridor, black, and I realized how different that was immediately from Iowa, where the janitors were all white. Then I walked into the dining room, and here I&#x27;m expecting to see this sea of white faces, and literally all over the dining room are black people. Admittedly, in a subservient role or workers in the dining hall. I felt very comfortable. I walked through the line and I got the biggest piece of apple pie because these folks were handing it out to me. They were saying, &quot;hey, we are glad you&#x27;re here. Boy, we&#x27;re going to take care of you.&quot; So, all of a sudden my world was a different one. It was, &quot;hey, you&#x27;re not alone at all. You&#x27;re the only student but, my gosh, look around you. You&#x27;re going to be taken care of because you&#x27;re back home in the South.&quot;  LYNN HAESSLY: I had wanted to ask you how you survived that experience emotionally. That was your support?  HARVEY B. GANTT: That was the initial support. I don&#x27;t think there is any environment I can ever go into where I&#x27;m not going to make friends with anybody, I don&#x27;t care how hostile you&#x27;re likely to be. Whether it&#x27;s a group of females or whether it, back in those days, being a single man, I could never believe that anybody could stay angry with me. I just always have this confidence that if I can get you to sit down and look you in the eye we can talk, we can get to know each other. So all of the business at that time about ostracizing this pioneer, this integrationist, who wants to destroy our way of life, all of the efforts to make me something other than a human being, all of those efforts that say that he was an agent of some evil force that was causing some changes, just was ridiculous on its face. I always had a feeling that South Carolina was going to be like South Carolina was going to be, which is aristocratic, dignified, stiff upper lip. We are going to resist this to the end but we are going to do it with dignity and when we lose we are going to lose with dignity. We were one of the thirteen original colonies, da da da da da. I grew up in Charleston, I was accustomed to this kind of aristocracy that says that even if I can&#x27;t appeal to your morality I can appeal to …, or to put it another way, if I couldn&#x27;t, in my efforts to get into Clemson, appeal to the morality of the situation, which is that I had a right to go there, I could ultimately win out on manners. They were going to do the right thing in the end because they were told to do so but they&#x27;d do it with dignity.  LYNN HAESSLY: Let me turn back and ask you about what the process was that enabled you to enter Clemson.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, after so many different efforts to get in at the beginning of the sophomore year at Iowa, I mean the latter part of freshman year at Iowa. Ultimately, I left Iowa State in the first quarter of my junior year, having filed a suit the previous summer, after we had tried on three different occasions for each semester to get in to it and being given different kinds of excuses.  LYNN HAESSLY: Who was &quot;we&quot;? You said &quot;we&quot; had tried to get in.  HARVEY B. GANTT: My lawyer and I. The first time I started this, I did it on my own and I sensed that they would do it. They sent me catalogs and nice things about Clemson. They delighted to have it in an application. I filled the application out and then we had trouble. The application then signalled that this was not a usual application because it was coming from a student who was at Iowa State who attended Burke High School in Charleston, South Carolina. Burke was known as a black school, so he had to be a black student. I got a letter back essentially saying, &quot;hey, we notice you are doing very well at Iowa State. You&#x27;re getting some state aid to go to school there, plus you are on a scholarship. Enjoy yourself!&quot; Then I got mad. I went back and said, &quot;but you don&#x27;t understand. I want to go school there.&quot; The same lawyer that assisted us, Matthew Perry, in the sit-in case in high school when we met at the march. I remembered his name; called him up; and told him what I&#x27;d done. He said, &quot;Great! Now, from now on, just send me a copy of all the letters you send them, a copy of all the letters they send back to you. And we&#x27;ll see if we can&#x27;t develop a file and if we can pursue it.&quot; And that&#x27;s what happened.  LYNN HAESSLY: Now, the case that led up to the Brown decision had been very much orchestrated by the Legal Defense Fund and they were bringing suits all over the country. Your decision to enter Clemson was not a part of that.  HARVEY B. GANTT: People keep wanting to make it that. No, it was not a part of that grand design. It really wasn&#x27;t. I never had anybody to talk to me about doing that or even thinking about doing that. A lot of people have wondered about that all these years. Stories about Harvey going to Iowa State as a kind of training for going to Clemson, and that it was planned by the Legal Defense Fund, but that is not true, absolutely not true, never was.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did you get any support from the NAACP after you began to file your suit?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Oh, the Legal Defense Fund took the case over once it had gotten to the point where it was clear that they were going to resist my application. We sought to exhaust all the administrative avenues we could force. And after Perry took the case, after about the third or fourth exchange of letters, and I think the state then knew that we would be getting some legal help.  LYNN HAESSLY: He was with the Legal Defense Fund?  HARVEY B. GANTT: He had his own law practice but he was like Julius Chambers. He was really employed by the Legal Defense Fund for a lot of the cases in South Carolina.  LYNN HAESSLY: So they paid the legal fees.  HARVEY B. GANTT: They paid our legal fees. My family didn&#x27;t have to pay it; they couldn&#x27;t afford it. I could not have afforded to do that. Let&#x27;s see. We proceeded to file it in district court in Anderson, South Carolina, and that was heard on its merit and the federal district judge ruled that Clemson was not guilty. So we took it to the court of appeals in less than three or four weeks, trying it in January of 1963 . And the court of appeals said, &quot;yes, you did discriminate. You&#x27;ve got to admit him.&quot; Then the State of South Carolina took it to the Supreme Court and they refused to hear it and that ended the case. What was remarkable about the whole thing was that it was like a charade; I mean, the state was going through the motions that had to be gone through in order to satisfy the people of South Carolina, or at least a portion of the people of South Carolina, that they had exhausted every legal remedy available to them before they let the gates open that would never be closed again.  LYNN HAESSLY: Tell me about the basketball bounced on the floor above your room.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I think too much has been made of that. I don&#x27;t recall any … Somebody developed that story and they&#x27;ve attributed it to me that people were rude and they bounced basketballs all night long and I never could go to sleep. That&#x27;s really not true. I don&#x27;t know where that came from. During the entire time that I was at Clemson, I had about three epithets hurled at me, and they were all done by someone who was on the fourth floor of some dorm, it was a Friday afternoon, he was probably drunk as hell, and he&#x27;d say something like &quot;nigger this&quot; and hide. I used to tell people maybe it was my size that kept people from coming up to me and doing some of the things that I&#x27;d heard had happened to other pioneers in situations like that, like being spat upon, being physically abused in some kind of way. That really just never happened. I&#x27;ve seen stories that attributed the basketball bouncing, I&#x27;ve heard Clemson students say that that occurred. Those were concrete floors and you would have to bounce a basketball pretty hard for me to have heard it. I made a habit of not sitting in front of an open window, little precautions I took to avoid the fate of some crazy person with a shotgun who might want to do something. But generally, I felt quite able to move about the campus quite freely. They had some guards who were rather unobtrusive and there was once that we played a game with a kid that I got to know in the architecture school. We were coming from class one day and we were fooling around, we lived in the same dorm, and we faked a fight, you know, we were just trying to see how much of the security that was still there. They came out of the woodwork. But other than that…  LYNN HAESSLY: Were you isolated in your dormitory?  HARVEY B. GANTT: No, we had people in our hall. The way the design of the hall was made up, there was a solid wall on one side, there were no rooms on the other side, there were rooms only on one side. They tended to put more mature students in that dorm. I did not have a roommate, by my own request. I didn&#x27;t want to have a roommate my last year.  LYNN HAESSLY: You met your wife, Lucinda Brawley, at Clemson. Was that relationship of being the first black student …  HARVEY B. GANTT: I didn&#x27;t intend to marry her then. I&#x27;m sorry what was your question?  LYNN HAESSLY: I just wanted to ask you what that was like and if that&#x27;s what drew you together.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes, somebody said, &quot;boy, you guys got caught in an environment where you were made for her and she was made for you and there was nobody else anyway so you might as well get married.&quot; It could have been like that. I met her prior to her coming to Clemson. I became a very famous person all of a sudden in the period leading up to that and so I went to speak to a lot of high schools and got to meet her and heard that she was interested in being a student at Clemson and she was a very smart girl. So I finished talking to her class and then we talked. She was pretty and I thought it was nice. She matriculated at Clemson the very next semester. She got in.  LYNN HAESSLY: With no question of her application?  HARVEY B. GANTT: With no fanfare, no questions about her application. She was more than well qualified for it and she was a math student. At first I had no idea of ever really dating her, you know, in the sense of carrying her out for a date. There were people who were quite concerned about my dating habits as to whether I would end up seeking to date one of the white girls on campus. That gave the president and some others a great deal of concern in that first semester with no one else there before Cindy came. There was a big dance, Brook Benton, a pop singer, was going to be there. I decided I wanted to go and a few people in the administration wanted me not to go because they thought that people would be drunk at the dance portion of the thing and I&#x27;m standing around, I might get some lonely young lady who would ask me for a dance and I would be crazy enough to dance with her. That might create a problem. Think about that.  LYNN HAESSLY: So did you go?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes, I went.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did you dance?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes, I danced.  LYNN HAESSLY: With white girls?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Yes.  LYNN HAESSLY: Any problems?  HARVEY B. GANTT: No. Nobody did anything. That&#x27;s the way I felt, anyway, that they wouldn&#x27;t. I just thought that the administration was a little bit too cautious. At any rate, that&#x27;s the only sign that people were concerned about what my social life might be like. One of the big fears of that period was the fear of the mixing of the races; the fear of interracial dating was always in the back of the minds of the dyed-in-wool segregationists. They saw that as the end of whatever. Then Cindy comes along and I just primarily treated her as a sister for maybe six months. I mean I would just take her and we&#x27;d go to dinner together, we&#x27;d occasionally go out on a date together. I&#x27;d introduce her around to the black community which was very nearby and it turned into other things.  LYNN HAESSLY: Did you feel that the attitudes towards racial mixing had to affect the way you came to college? Did you feel like you needed to be extra careful because of it?  HARVEY B. GANTT: No. I didn&#x27;t believe in that attitude and I guess I was developing fast as being a person who would, if I didn&#x27;t believe it I could take it all away. I couldn&#x27;t support doing something that was not a part of my belief system. What I&#x27;m saying is that if I met a person and I liked that person I thought I had the right to talk to that person and be whatever I wanted within the bounds of decorum and everything else, with the values of our society. But someone simply say that because I&#x27;m black I can&#x27;t talk to someone white insults me in terms of who I am. So you can&#x27;t confine me that way and I refuse to be confined that way. So, I admired some very attractive girls that were on campus but I&#x27;ve never been aggressive in the sense of pursuing them and I didn&#x27;t in that case. I think most of my concentration probably was on my studies and my social life was somewhat limited.  LYNN HAESSLY: How would you characterize your education at Clemson? I mean the quality of your professional training.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Very good. Much better than average. I&#x27;m not saying that individually I got better or special treatment, I just think that the program in the School of Architecture was a very, very good one, and it still is. I&#x27;m still hiring students from that program. I think they are the best architectural school in three states, but Georgia Tech and N. C. State are having problems.  LYNN HAESSLY: In 1965 when you graduated from Clemson, did you consider going to Charleston or did you, when I looked at your background thinking of the social atmosphere in Charleston and Charlotte as a New South city, were those the kinds of things that you were balancing when you picked Charlotte?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Probably not very consciously but I admit the reason I didn&#x27;t stay in South Carolina was that nobody offered me a job. It was about as simple as that. Not that people wouldn&#x27;t have offered me a job, I was graduating third in my class in architecture, and usually the first three or four or five students are the ones that are gobbled up. It didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out I wasn&#x27;t getting the offers from South Carolina, I was getting them from North Carolina and Georgia, Atlanta specifically. I came to Charlotte because I got the best offer. I had never heard of the place; I mean, I&#x27;d heard of it, I&#x27;d been here once during a civil rights rally or something back when I was in college, and I guess it was prior to me going to Clemson. Other than that, I knew nothing about Charlotte. Beyond the North Carolina colleges that I grew up being familiar with—A. &amp; T. and Central—we didn&#x27;t pay much attention to North Carolina. But the first time I saw Charlotte I fell in love with it.  LYNN HAESSLY: Why?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, it just seemed perfect in terms of size. It just had an air about it that said, &quot;hey, here is a place that&#x27;s growing. You might be able to grow with it.&quot; Besides I got the best job offer, as I said. Atlanta was too big, kind of overwhelming. I was newly married. I thought that we could do better in Charlotte. God, I&#x27;m glad I made that decision! [laughter]   LYNN HAESSLY: When you&#x27;d been talking about your involvement in civil rights, it seems like you&#x27;re very much of the generation of Jesse Jackson, younger than King, that group that came up with the expectations of Brown, but older than Rap Brown and Stokely [Carmichael] who moved on to black power. Do you think that is kind of an accurate assessment of where you might fall?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, we&#x27;re in the group now that are becoming the mayors. We did the demonstration things, too, believe me, in the King philosophy. We saw what happened to the black power movement and probably never thought it was reasonable. Many of the people who led those movements, Stokely and Rap and others came from the North, really, they were not Southerners. We Southerners growing up under the shadow of King really did see change occur, dramatic change, and so there was a certain believability about pushing direct action and then ultimately evolving that into politics that made some sense to us. Jesse really is still a civil rights activist, he and I really have taken two slightly different roads. I&#x27;m more a believer in taking the benefits that were brought about by Martin and Jesse and all the other direct action kinds of things and molding them into long-term, institutional changes that would occur, systemic changes that have occurred in our society. I read about the Observer&#x27;s report yesterday on the increasing amount of blacks that are registering. That is significant to me and its been significant enough in this community that I&#x27;ve been elected to public office and it&#x27;s been in no small part due to the increased amount of participation by black voters in the electoral process. We see that now as the vehicle for change: to assume and to aim higher in local and state and other places to bring about, carry on that revolution that started back there when the Supreme Court made that decision. And so for us, it was the civil rights movement had its purpose; black power, those people were slightly younger than we are (well, I guess, we&#x27;re really about the same age) that was an offshoot of the student non-violent coordinating committee, the shock troops of the civil rights movement that got disillusioned with the lack of more rapid progress, the falling away and the more tension beginning with the Vietnam war that got into totally different things. Again, you know, you&#x27;ve got to remember folks that came from the South, many of us were very much attuned to the changes that we saw occurring that were in our eyesight dramatic and many of us came from those middle-class type environments that said, you know, the way to do things is not to destroy them but to try to negotiate power.  LYNN HAESSLY: I&#x27;ve read that many white voters who vote for Jesse Helms also vote for you.  HARVEY B. GANTT: That&#x27;s remarkable, isn&#x27;t it?  LYNN HAESSLY: I&#x27;d just like to know what your assessment of that is.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Where did you read that? [laughter] Well, it is true, well at least we track that in our own  political campaigns. I think people really do believe, or think they want people who will serve them in public office who will tell them like it is. They think Jesse Helms tells it like it is. Jesse Helms stands for a lot of things that in my opinion are anathema to what&#x27;s good for North Carolina. But people find a believability in Jesse. He understands them. What I&#x27;ve noticed in Charlotte is that people believe me, they don&#x27;t agree always with me. But when I say it they believe it, they don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m putting them on. And they don&#x27;t believe that I say things simply for political effect, having no meaning or substance to it. And I suspect that there is a degree of comfort in the average citizen to know that even though I don&#x27;t agree with the guy, I know he&#x27;s honest. I hear them saying that about Jesse, too. He didn&#x27;t like Martin Luther King and he didn&#x27;t try to tell you he did. They like that. It gave them some comfort, they have to agree with him on that, some of them. But for them they are uncomfortable with the politician.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  LYNN HAESSLY: Can you tell me about your involvement with Soul City?  HARVEY B. GANTT: When I left graduate school, I left Boston and came south, I accepted a joint appointment, one which took me to Chapel Hill to do a visiting lectureship in the planning school. And I would spend three days a week working with Floyd McKissick in Warren County on something called the Warren Regional Planning Corporation, which was an organization that had gotten a 701 planning grant to study a new town in that area. It was all an effort on the part of Republicans to provide a way to enhance economic development and the Democrats for that matter, Governor Robert Scott, I think, was governor of North Carolina at the time.  LYNN HAESSLY: What year was that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: &#x27;70. Anyway, this grant was there, and I went down to work as a senior planner on a project. I was already a registered architect, now with a new master&#x27;s degree. I helped to assemble a group of eight or nine people who were economists, housers, people who worked in housing, land planners, and designs of that nature. And I served one year as a senior planner and then as a director of planning for what we called the overall base maps for how to use something like two thousand acres of land. So I got to work with Floyd for two years. It was very exciting to work on this idea of a new town being grown literally out of the tobacco fields of North Carolina&#x27;s eastern corridor where there was a great deal of poverty. Floyd&#x27;s idea of a new town where you built an economic base as an alternative to the welfare state, appealed to me. It was a very Republican idea but it was a very appealing one to a fledgling planner who was looking for experimentation in an area that architects and planners could find fascinating. It also was occurring at a time when there was a great deal of emphasis being placed by the Nixon administration on new towns. And Soul City ultimately ended up being one of twenty new towns that got started, all of which were fraught with massive problems; i.e., concepts of how you put them together financially. But I stayed there from 1970, June, through October of 1971. I did the visiting lectureship for three semesters in Chapel Hill.  LYNN HAESSLY: Why do you think Soul City failed?  HARVEY B. GANTT: For what I just said earlier.  LYNN HAESSLY: Jesse Helms had a certain amount to do with that.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, no. Jesse Helms was more extraneous to it, you know. He would like to have you believe that he did but I don&#x27;t agree with that. I think that had Soul City been rolling along, selling land at a pace that could ultimately pay the interest or service the debt for the funds granted by the federal government, Jesse Helms or no one else could have touched it because it would have been a successful experiment working itself out. But it didn&#x27;t do that, as did most of the other new towns that had a better chance, I think, than Soul City. Soul City was built about fifty miles from any large town, and it was the only new town that was going to be holding on, so to speak. The others were parasites to larger metropolitan areas and were just better planned housing communities, in my opinion.  LYNN HAESSLY: Something located like Research Triangle? That&#x27;s not a new town, but having a better location.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, Research Triangle still is parasitic, in my opinion. It&#x27;s basis for being is the universities that exist in other towns. Most of the other new towns were the same way. I mean, if you built one outside of Minneapolis you could enjoy being on the Minneapolis housing market. And you are just simply doing a better job of subdivision planning because you are going to put a little more mixed use in it. Soul City was an experiment to try in the middle of nowhere to grow an economic base, which meant that you really have to start with selling the land off to industrial locations, and build plants and jobs—create the market, which Floyd McKissick didn&#x27;t do. He wasn&#x27;t willing to wait that time. He started off with a small subdivision which was about all they ultimately got built, just one subdivision and then some other out-buildings, one of which my architecture firm designed for them. But, the town failed because they couldn&#x27;t sell the land, they couldn&#x27;t make that concept go. And when they couldn&#x27;t sell, it didn&#x27;t take long for political enemies to think that Floyd had just wasted federal dollars. The good that it did do, though, was that it provided Henderson and Oxford with a water source. It got some more sophisticated water sewer systems into that area and I think the area is ripe now for further industrial development. This is precisely the kind of thing they wanted to accomplish. They can do it. Maybe not through a private company, but maybe if there is an aggressiveness on the part of the Warren County board of county commissioners and some industrial development people they can probably still pull that off, primarily with more industry. I always thought you had to have a lot of industry.  LYNN HAESSLY: Let&#x27;s turn to Charlotte politics. It was not that long after you ended your involvement with Soul City that you got your first appointment to a council seat here.  HARVEY B. GANTT: Well, it was three years. I mean, I got that appointment that December of 1974 to fulfill a term. I didn&#x27;t come here with the intentions of going into elected politics. But I did come here and got very much involved in architectural type activities with the AIA, American Institute of Architects, and got involved in a task force study of the planning and development going on here in Charlotte that got a lot of attention in &#x27;74. I think that ultimately gave me the visibility that you wouldn&#x27;t normally get because of what we said in that planning study. A lot of what we said then we have started to take up over the twelve years I&#x27;ve been involved in local politics, which is much more now than we have had in the past. A greater degree of relationship between land use and transportation which is important to a city. So, in that period from leaving Soul City to coming to Charlotte by way of involvement in civic activities with the AIA, we got a little bit of attention and ultimately got appointed to fulfill an unexpired term. When I served that one time I liked it so much I decided to run again.  LYNN HAESSLY: I&#x27;ve talked to reporters who covered you and they say that you really enjoy the political process, that being out and meeting people and all those kinds of things. I would find it very gruelling and I&#x27;d just like to ask you why you enjoy it.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I love people. I love this city. I like what I&#x27;m doing. I think I&#x27;m very comfortable with myself first, so you start there and then the second thing is that I&#x27;ve always been one who sort of enjoyed working with people. My mother tells a joke about as a boy growing up and wanted to keep all the little boys in my yard playing marbles. I would always be inventing things to do to keep them interested. She said a little bit manipulative maybe, too, to the extent that I would open up the refrigerator and whatever was in there my playmates would have their choice. Apples, for example. She buys a dozen and I take the apples out and there was somebody who looked like they were getting a little impatient, I&#x27;d offer apples to the crowd. Well, people see that as an effort always to try to work with people and to be with them and I don&#x27;t like being alone. I like being around people. Yet, in many ways I am alone in this office. I mean, being the mayor, but I just enjoy working with folks.  LYNN HAESSLY: When you said that you were infatuated with politics, there is certainly more to politics than involvement with people. What else have you been infatuated with?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Power. To get things done, I mean. You know, mayors in North Carolina are not strong mayors as they are in other states. But Charlotte comes closest to being the strongest mayor that you have with veto power and the ability to appoint people, the ability to set the agenda for what the city ought to be thinking about or doing. It is definitely in the mayor&#x27;s office and it has been dictated in the years past by other mayors. But it&#x27;s the ability to get things to happen for the good. I think I&#x27;ve seen a different kind of world since being an eleven-year-old boy. That big decision on segregation being unconstitution. There is a different possibility for the South and for North Carolina and South Carolina and other places. And I think in my own mind I see that unfolding every day. And the ability to help that unfold, to see a state where education is a top priority and people are literate, trained using the best of all of our resources, whether they are black or white, is important to me. If I get an opportunity to get that to happen just a little bit quicker by being mayor of Charlotte, it&#x27;s important to move us along.  LYNN HAESSLY: What would you say is you biggest accomplishment as mayor?  HARVEY B. GANTT: People working together. There is a lot more communication in this town than in a lot of other places. When I hear about other communities having race relation problems, Charlotte certainly hasn&#x27;t reached the millenium in terms of that either but there is a fairly good network going on in this community. I can pick the phone up right now and talk to the Greek community, the Jewish community, the black community, and so forth and so on. And we can have everybody in this office inside a couple of hours to resolve a problem. That&#x27;s very important. It&#x27;s just as important as getting the community to attract new industry, build the next highrise, build the next park. When you&#x27;ve got the people sort of working together you can get them to put away their thing for our thing, that is the city. That to me is a big accomplishment. I see a lot of that happening. We passed a lot of bond issues, big ones, since I&#x27;ve been mayor and they&#x27;ve all overwhelmingly passed because we could get a diverse group of people who might have been disparate on that issue but once we get them in here and start talking and we get them to go with us, the city.  LYNN HAESSLY: That style sounds very different from that of your predecessor, Eddie Knox, who I&#x27;ve heard characterized as an arm twister.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I don&#x27;t twist arms very well, but I try persuade you in other ways.  LYNN HAESSLY: Where would you like to be more effective?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Where? I want to be very effective doing this job.  LYNN HAESSLY: I meant in what kind of areas would you like to be more effective as mayor.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I want to have more influence on young people. I want them to grow faster, maybe, and that&#x27;s not realistic. But I do spend a lot of time worrying about whether or not a forty-three-year-old mayor has any influence on a sixteen-year-old high school kid about what direction he ought to go in. I think I see things about what&#x27;s going on, what&#x27;s going to happen in the nation that I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s seeing. And I worry a little bit about it. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a father of four children, and I&#x27;ve got two teenage daughters and one who&#x27;s in college. I wish I could be more effective there. As far as the actual machinations of this government in terms of what we&#x27;re doing, I&#x27;m comfortable. I think the people who need to hear what my thinking is and the people I need to work with, the city council, the manager, we enjoy a very positive up-beat relationship. I think I couldn&#x27;t ask anything better. But it is how the constituency is hearing me. And I believe that the older constituents are hearing them and the election was as good an example of that as anything that someone who publishes has talked about. They heard it. But I&#x27;m always sure younger people hear.  LYNN HAESSLY: One question on political ambition and possibilities. In looking for a 1986 U.S. Senate candidate for the Democrats, your name is not one name that I&#x27;ve heard mentioned and you seem to me that you would be a politically ambitious man, but it seems that some possibilities are limited. What are your thoughts about that?  HARVEY B. GANTT: I didn&#x27;t get the last part of the question. Some possibilities of it?  LYNN HAESSLY: Some possibility at this time might be warranted.  HARVEY B. GANTT: I&#x27;m not running for the Senate in 1986 and I don&#x27;t think you would hear my name. First of all, you&#x27;ve heard too many names from Charlotte already. So, you wouldn&#x27;t likely hear me interested in it. I was busy running in the campaign telling people of this community that I wanted to be their mayor for the next two years when everybody else was should I do the Senate thing so it would have been inconsistent for me to be interested in the mayor&#x27;s job and also interested in running for the U.S. Senate seat. One day maybe I&#x27;ll want to do that. I don&#x27;t want to do that now. I&#x27;m kind of one-track. I want to do this and do it well. And if the spirit of the Lord tells me that I need to be looking somewhere else maybe I&#x27;ll look somewhere else. But there are a lot of other good people out there. I&#x27;m an ambitious person but I don&#x27;t believe in serving in a public office with the sole purpose of stepping up to the next office. It happened from being appointed to running for the election, I felt the need to serve as councilman. When the position came open with Eddie Knox announcing his candidacy as mayor in 1979 I thought that I was better qualified than he was, having served and he hadn&#x27;t. That was my rationale for doing what I did at that point. People now automatically say, &quot;well, you know, where do you go in Charlotte politics after you&#x27;ve been mayor? You can&#x27;t do anything else here, you got to go to another level. You&#x27;ve got to go to Raleigh or you&#x27;ve got to go to Washington. I don&#x27;t think you have to go anywhere. You can do a job here and quit, rest, relax, re-create yourself, and then see if there is something that you really want to do. And since there is nothing I really want to do then  LYNN HAESSLY: Well?  HARVEY B. GANTT: Got it?  LYNN HAESSLY: Yes, thank you.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>!    I i       This is Sunday afternoon, February 2, 1986.  I am Ben Bulla &#x27;      in the home of Mr. G Mrs. James &quot;Jim&quot; Sloan of 509 West Fifth St I  |   in Gastonia, N. C.  Mrs. Sloan is known by the nickname of &quot;Mutt&quot; I J        and her husband is called &quot;Jim&quot; and they were good friends of Katherine and Everett Jordan, and visited withthem in Montreat where the Sloans also have summer home. Ben Bulla:  When did you first meet Katherine and Everett Jordan? Mutt:  Well we&#x27;ve known Everett--gosh, we&#x27;ve known him since he came to Gastonia as a young boy. BB:  How old was he when he came here? Mutt:  I don&#x27;t know--he hadn&#x27;t gone to college. BB:  You&#x27;ve heard his father nreach? Mutt:  Oh I&#x27;ve heard his father preach--yes--but I don&#x27;t know that he was one--now you don&#x27;t quote me--I don&#x27;t know that he was an outstanding r&gt;reacher--he was a good man and all, and he raised nice v. V  children.  I&#x27;ve heard Everett tell this--he&#x27;d say his daddy--well to start off with:  We had this man in Gastonia who was a prominent mill /man named J. Seamark and he started a lot of our cotton mills around N /here and he took a fancy to Everett.  Well he was a big Methodist and v j he gave Everett a job in the mill as a sweener and Everett worked at \o /it before he went to college, and then he helned him get in big.  But in the meantime they said that Everett worked in the mill a while then he decided he&#x27;d go west, and he went to Texas somewhere--worked ^S &quot;  in a jewelry store, but said he didn&#x27;t like it out there, because he I   was used to being in a Methodist congregation and Methodist town where people knew his father and everybody was friendly and you know--folksy-he didn&#x27;t like it out west and he came back home, and when he came \ back home Mr. SEapark made him superintendent of one of his mills. See he was being sponsored by this man that was real prominent and had a lot of businesses.  Then--it was before the degression I think Mrs. James Sloan 2-2-86 2 --I remember that there was some men that heard that the Saxapahaw mill was going to be sold and they wanted to invest in it.  I guess it was Mr. Seapark and some of his mill people, and they wanted to invest in it and they asked Everett if he would like to go down there and run it.  And I understood that Everett and Katherine put everything in the world they had in that mill.  So they went down there to run the mill and they put every nenny they could scrane together in that mill--it was before the depression--and I think they went through some pretty rough times, because back then things were just bad, but he came out and just did great. BB:  What kind of sermons did Rev. Jordan preach? MS:  Typical.  Typical Methodist preacher&#x27;s sermons.  He was against everything.  I mean, you know, as far as drinking and you know how the Methodists are, they are very opposed--they drink, but that&#x27;s one of their main things is sign the temperence thing.  But I can&#x27;t tell you, really, much about those people except that we did know Everett and Katherine. BB:  Over in Montreat when Everett sat on your front porch and talked did he tell any stories? MS:  I don&#x27;t remember him telling any stories much.  He would tell us a little about life in Washington and how he felt about different things and we would kind of pick him about different things you know in Washington, but he wasn&#x27;t telling us a whole lot about what was going on ur&gt; there or how he felt about it.  Now Mrs. McLean told v me this:  That she and her husband were ur&gt; at Katherine&#x27; s--her husband, I of course, is Katherine&#x27;s brother--they were up there spending the weekend and Katherine had sunner ready and Everett didn&#x27;t come, and y Mrs. James Sloan  2-2-86                                                                                     3 didn&#x27;t come, didn&#x27;t come and they said that finally he came in late ) after they had all finished eating and Katherine jumped on him and  ( he said he had just been to a meeting and that he had taken the     / chairmanship of the N. C. Democratic party, and said Katherine just  \ laid him out.  She said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got enough right here to keep you busy looking after us and the mill and all like that.&quot;  And said she just laid him out, but he--BB:  Mrs. McLean told you this? MS:  Yes.  Well he kept it, and she said that was the only political office he ever had until he was elected Senator.  So he helped all of the old politicians and when the time came and he ran-I believe she told me that Luther Hodges got Everett to run for the Senate. And the story was that when Luther got Everett up there and when he got ready Luther was going to take it over.  But it didn&#x27;t turn out--I don&#x27;t believe Luther Hodges was ever Senator. BB:  Luther Hodges was governor when he appointed him Senator--MS:  Well you know how those things were--anyhow she said that Everett never had a political office except head of the Democratic Party until he ran for Senate.  That he had helped so many politicians and worked with them and everything like that and they liked him so he didn&#x27;t have any problem getting elected.  And I&#x27;ll never know why he got defeated the last time--I never did understand that.  Was that Jesse Helms that defeated him? BB MS BB MS Nick Galifinakis. You don&#x27;t mean from Durham!  He defeated Everett? In the primary. Well that&#x27;s hard to understand; now what was back of that? Mrs. James Sloan  2-2-86                                                                                     4 BB:  Well you said age and health; those were the two main things that people tell me mostly. MS:  But he had such a good record and everybody thought so highly of him and everybody liked him so much--we were really shocked and I think he was too; that he was defeated. BB:  Yes, I think he was surprised.  Did folks in Gastonia support him pretty well? MS:  Yes.  They liked him.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say that they liked him, that he was one of their favorite politicians, however he got beat and that&#x27;s just what I couldn&#x27;t quite understand.  Of course people in Gastonia weren&#x27;t the total picture. BB:  Well your son Jim said you might know some humorous stories that he told in your presence--that you might remember them. MS:  Now I can&#x27;t remember anything very humorous.  I may be like Katherine, my mind--but, no we had a lot of humorous stories up there at Montreat, but I don&#x27;t ever remember Everett telling--Mrs. McLean might know some.  But Mrs. McLean has told me about Everett:  Sometimes he was gone a lot and Katherine worried that he didn&#x27;t spend enough time with the children, so she said that if one of the children got sick she would call Everett from the mill and tell him to come on that she wanted him to take John or Ben or Rose Anne to the doctor--so he would keep in touch with his family, and she said that she just kind of let him take a lot of the responsibility of those children. But I really can&#x27;t think of anything very humorous about any of those Jordans except Frank and Margaret, they laughed all the time, but I don&#x27;t remember what they laughed at.  I wish I did.  It looks like Margaret--she&#x27;s got a good sense of humor, maybe she&#x27;d have some Mrs. Jim Sloan  2-2-86                                                                                         5 funny stories to tell you. BB:  She&#x27;s told me a few, but I wanted to get some more that she might have forgotton or didn&#x27;t even hear.  The more I get the better-more to choose from. MS:     But I would think that Margaret would be a prime source of anything like that. BB:     She&#x27;s been very helpful. MS:     Now she lives in Mocksville? BB:     Yes I&#x27;ve been in their home two or three times. MS:     Married Henry Sprinkle.  Is he still living? BB:     Yes. MS:  Is Frank&#x27;s widow still living--Frances? BB:  No she&#x27;s dead.  She died some time ago. MS:  Well I wish I could tell you--wish you could write a book on the funny stories I could tell you, but BB:  Well anything you can think of about the Jordans.  Anything. What kind of fellow was Everett Jordan? MS:  Oh he was a gentleman!  When he&#x27;d come to our house, if we were not there he&#x27;*/ leave his card with United States Senate on it-- I&#x27;ve got some up there in the drawer now.  He was a real gentleman and real proud, I think, of his background and where he had gotton to, and I don&#x27;t blame him. BB:  He came to see you at Montreat or Gastonia? MS:  He never came to see us in Gastonia.  We&#x27;ve never been to see them in Saxapapaw--it was in Montreat that we saw them. BB:  Did you have a home in Montreat? MS:  Yes we&#x27;ve  got a home in Montreat up the road from them.  It&#x27;s Mrs  Jim Sloan  2-2-86                                                                                         6 between the Jordans and going up to Mrs. McLeans on Kentucky Road. I don&#x27;t guess we ever had an awful lot of close association with he and Katherine--they were a little older than we were to begin with-- not a whole lot.  Now let&#x27;s see Lucy was the oldest and I guess Everett was next, then I guess Henry and then Charlie, then Frank and then Margaret.  I guess that&#x27;s the way it went. BB:  Margaret may be older than Frank, I&#x27;m not sure. MS:  She may be.  Now was Henry Sprinkle a minister? BB:  Yes, he was a Methodist minister also. MS:  Well then he wrote for some publications -- BB:  Yes he was a writer too. MS:  I remember him more as a writer than a preacher. BB:  He could do this job better than me. MS:  Well get him to co-author with you. BB:  Well so far it&#x27;s been my responsibility, but I appreciate all the help I can get from anybody. MS:  I wish I had all sorts of help for you--I&#x27;ve heard them talk about their daddy.  He always raised those boys to be polite to everybody, and being in the Methodist preacher&#x27;s children, he wanted them to always put their best foot forward, which we all do for our children--and they said that Mr. Jordan would tell them, &quot;Now when you walk down the street you speak to everybody you see, because you don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re in our church or who they are.&quot;  And they \ said that Mr. Jordan would walk down the street and sometime he would \ be so deep in thought that he would pass by one of his children and say, &quot;Hello, how are you this morning&quot; not even realizing who he was talki^nr to--I always thought that was kind of cute--he&#x27;d pass by Mrs. Jim Sloan  2-2-86                                                                                         7 &gt; his own children and he was so used to saying, you know-being nice to everybody-- BB:  Now that&#x27;s the kind of material I need. MS:  Yes, well that&#x27;s about all I can think of.  He trained them--and they said that&#x27;s why when Everett went out West he didn&#x27;t like it because people weren&#x27;t friendly and nice to him.  Did you ever hear that he worked at a jewelry store out in Texas. BB:  Yes, I&#x27;ve been out there. MS:  In Texas? BB:  It was in Kansas.  Wellington Kansas. MS:  Well I&#x27;ll be dog I thought it was in Twxas.  Well did anybody remember him out there? BB:  I talked to his girlfriend. MS:  You&#x27;re kidding!  How long did he stay out there? BB:  He stayed a few years, I don&#x27;t remember exactly how long. MS:  I didnit know he stayed that long.  I just really feel like I ought to know more about them than I do, but you know Katherine is not a very--oh she&#x27;s very contained, she doesn&#x27;t tell you a whole lot. BB:  She has forgotton a lot she tellime, and she also says that Everett did not discuss politics and the mill with her. MS:  Well he was rather reluctant to tell us--we would pick him; you know how you&#x27;ll do.  We say, &quot;What do you think about this&quot; and &quot;What do you think about that&quot; and he would, I guess express his opinion if he could without committing himself too much. BB:  What kind of Senator was he? MS:  I think he was one of our better Senators--[end of side one] .....but he should not have run that last time. Mrs Jim Sloan  2-2-86 8 I&#x27;ve never had anybody in my family in politics.  I&#x27;ve always been interested, but I don&#x27;t really know--but I do remember that people felt like he shouldn&#x27;t have run that last time. BB:  Because of his age? MS:  Well I guess that&#x27;s it and his health.  Now Everett would get sick up there at Montreat and Jim would come over and check on him. I never did know what ailed him, and I don&#x27;t really know what killed him. BB:  He had cancer. MS:  Did he have cancer?  Prostate I believe.  Seems to me that&#x27;s what his trouble was.  When he&#x27;d get sick up there at Montreat they would call Jim to come over there and I don&#x27;t know what Jim would do--you know that&#x27;s another thing.  Doctors don&#x27;t tell you anything. BB:  Jim&#x27;s office was in Asheville at the time wasn&#x27;t it? MS:  Yes. BB:  Is he a pieditrician? MS:  No he&#x27;s a G. P.  He&#x27;s got his board in family practice.  When he started in Asheville--Lord he would make house calls!  He&#x27;d get in that car and go all the way up in the mountains. BB:  Let me ask Mr. Sloan about Charlie.  Mr. Sloan, say you and Charlie were room mates down at Trinity? MR.S:Yes, we roomed together three years.  He was one year ahead of me. BB:  What kind of a man was Charlie Jordan? Mr. S:  He was a nice fellow.  Nice fellow. Mrs. SI.:  I can tell you a joke on me with Charlie Jordan, but it dosn&#x27;t have anything to do with your book. BB:  That&#x27;s O.K. The Sloans  2-2-86                                                                                                 9 Mrs. S:  He came here one time to talk to the Duke alumni banquet, so we invited him to stay at our house--right here in this old house--and I cleaned up the guest room and oh I had everything just as good as I could get it--back then I was in much better shape than I am now--and the house was a lot nicer, but anyhow I went up stairs right before he was to come, and just as I was going out to close the door to the guest room a little mouse came flying from under the closet door into the room.  I WAS A WRECK!  I couldn&#x27;t bear the idea of him having a mouse in his room.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I don&#x27;t think I ever did locate the mouse and get him out of there.  I remember that visit as not being very relaxed. BB:  Did Charlie Jordan ever see the mouse? Mrs. S:  I don&#x27;t know whether he ever saw it or not, but he was nice enough not to comment.  I don&#x27;t know whether it got on him that night or not.  That always happens.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen a mouse in that house before or since then. .......BB:  79 Mrs. S:  Was he just 79? 7-7 BB:  He was born in 1896 and died in March of 1974 so he was 7-3&quot; when he died.  [77] BB:  So you and Katherine were both Presbyterians? Mrs. S:  Right.  They were married in the Presbyterian church.  Dr. Hinderlight was our preacher and his [Everett Jordan&#x27;s] daddy and Dr. Hinderlight married them. BB:  Did you go to the wedding? Mrs. S:  No I don&#x27;t remember a thing about going to the wedding. They were a little older than we were and I guess we weren&#x27;t invited. The Sloans 2-2-86 10 I was trying to think--I don&#x27;t believe he and Katherine celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.  From 24 to 74--they wouldn&#x27;t have missed it far.  They were married in November and he died in March so they didn&#x27;t celebrate their 50th. real Mrs. S:  .....The Jordan boys were/popular.  Women liked them. BB:  Because of their good looks or what? Mrs. S:  Well it wasn&#x27;t their good--I better not say--they were nice looking certainly, but they weren&#x27;t the type that a lot of women--but they were just nice, entertaining, interesting fellows. BB:  They had a lot of girl friends then? Mrs. S:  Well as far as I know they had plenty.  I don&#x27;t know any definite ones, but up there at Montreat, even after they&#x27;d been married--you know there&#x27;d be some woman over there at the boarding house and we&#x27;d laugh about it--you know--she would be up there without her husband and they would kid about it--I&#x27;d meet all these people and I&#x27;d introduce them to him.  They--women seemed to take to him pretty well.  Now Frank was not particularly good looking.  Charlie was good-looking and I thought Everett was nice looking.  Henry was nice looking.  Did you ever know Frank? BB:  I knew all the boys.  I did not know Lucy. Mrs. S:  Of course Lucy--that was real interesting--my cousin that lives right next door to us over here--and his wife&#x27;s sister married Lucy&#x27;s son, Jimmy Taylor, down at Mt. Crogan.  Jimmy&#x27;s a cute fellow. They come up here real often.  I remember Lucy to a certain extent. I guess she lived here a while.  I don&#x27;t know when she married.  She married twice? BB:  Her first husband died. The Sloans  2-2-86 11 Mrs. S:  Was that Taylor? BB:  I don&#x27;t remember which.  ONe of them was a Taylor. Mrs. S:  I think Taylor was the first one--the one she had the children--then she married an older man--what was his name. BB:  According to some folks--Everett Jordan would get his audience in laughter by telling funny stories-- Mrs S:  When we knew Everett--he was getting old then and not too well I guess--! don&#x27;t remember any stories.  You know when you&#x27;re young you can be awfully funny, but as you get older things are not so funny. BB:  Were you here when they had the Loray Mills strike? Mrs. S:  We were here and I mean we were scared. BB:  Tell me what happened? Mrs. S:  Well truck loads of people came in here from land knows where.  There was a girl named Ella Mae Williams got killed--oh we were scared, and these friends of our that ran the mill lived out there and they would get up and ride around their driveway and shoot and carry on and--my daddy was in the mill business.  I don&#x27;t know whether he was in the mill business then or not.  I doubt it--he wasn&#x27;t connected with Firestone.  That seemed to be the basis of the trouble. BB:  Was Firestone the same plant-- Mrs. S:  Right up here you can practically see it.  You see the big tank up there. BB:  That was the Loray Cotton Mill where all the trouble was? Mrs. S:  The largest mill under one roof in the South--used to be, and it&#x27;s still Firestone and it&#x27;s the identical mill. i The Sloans  2-2-86                                                                                               12 BB:  What started the trouble in the very beginning? Mrs. S:  You know I don&#x27;t know that there was any reason for the trouble, I think that they brought in these strikers, as they would call them, to get the mill people stirred up.  Now you know I&#x27;m talking about something I don&#x27;t know for sure where they came from. They were not local I don&#x27;t think. BB:  Well some fellow, who was here at the time as an employee, told me that the company had these employees in their houses and the company put people out in the street and they lived in a tent city during that period of time; part of them did. Mrs. S:  Now those people that came in here from wherever, may have lived in tents. BB:  Well he was saying that the company put them out of their houses because they were striking. Mrs. S:  I don&#x27;t remember anything about that.  Of course I was a whole lot younger then and I wasn&#x27;t paying a whole lot of attention to it--to things like that.  But I don&#x27;t believe that the average worker at Firestone struck.  In my opinion--of that whole business was--it was all outsiders sent in here to start trouble.  Our chief of police got killed!  He was in it too and they shot him. BB:  Who shot him? Mrs. S:  The strikers --wasn&#x27;t it the strikers that shot Adderholt? Mr. S:  Yeah. Mrs. S:  I know it was, but now who those strikers were-- BB:  Did things settle down pretty soon after the strike was over? Mrs. S:  Well it created a awful lot of talking and excitement, and there has been book after book written about it. The Sloans  2-2-86 13 BB:  Did it tear up the churches any? Mrs. S:  Not that I know of.  I don&#x27;t remember any of the other mills being involved in it.  I don&#x27;t believe they were. BB:  Who owned the Loray mills at that time--the Love family? Mrs. S:  No.  Firestone didn&#x27;t have them then did they? BB:  No it was Loray I think. Mrs. S:  It was Rudolph Johnson&#x27;s daddy and Hester Johnson&#x27;s daddy that ran that mill, but he didn&#x27;t own it.  I don&#x27;t know who owned it. BB:  Was Joe Separk involved in that mill? Mrs. S:  No.  I don&#x27;t think so.  They had their own--Grays and Myrtle mills.  They had all their family things. BB:  Are all those plants still standing--the Gray and Myrtle Mills? Mrs. S:  I don&#x27;t know, I guess they still are standing--but the whole thing was--it&#x27;s a long story, but Seapark and them-- all these huge salaries they paid themselves and they built these gorgeous houses and the first thing you know they were hard up.  A. G. Meyers, that was our banker, and some of his folks went in and bought that mill and named it Textiles.  They had all the mills--Seaparks and..[end of tape]</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interview with Joseph Carlyle Sitterson February 19, 1985 Chapel Hill, North Carolina by Pamela Dean Transcribed by Amy Glass The Southern Oral History Program University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 1 Pamela Dean: This is Pamela Dean. The date is February 19th, 1985. I&#x27;m going to be talking to Dr. Carlyle Sitterson, retired history professor and former Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  We&#x27;ll be talking in his office in Hamilton Hall. Carlyle Sitterson: I&#x27;m Joseph Carlyle Sitterson. I was born in Kinston, North Carolina, on January 17, 1911. As a matter of fact, in those days very few babies were born in hospita1s--they were most all born at home--and I was born in a room which I later used as a bedroom many years of my life. That&#x27;s something that couldn&#x27;t happen today. Kinston in those days was a much smaller place than it is today. It was a small town and hadn&#x27;t had much influx of new people, thus, in one sense there was a lot of family continuity. Both sides of my family, for example, were from eastern North Carolina. My father&#x27;s family from Williamston. After he came to Kinston he married my mother who was from a family in that section of eastern North Carolina. He went into a wholesale business, prospered for a period of time, but was virtually  wiped  out  in  the  Great  Depression  which followed World War I. Again, not so many people today are aware (because 1929 has become the Great Depression) that actually, the collapse of 1920-21 that took place following World War I was in many ways more devastating in it&#x27;s impact on businesses. It didn&#x27;t last as long, thus we had a spectacular economic expansion in the &#x27;20&#x27;s, and so people have glossed over that early period. P.D.:  So this had a real impact on your family? Sitterson: Oh yes. It had an impact on my family. My mother was a musician and began teaching piano, and did for all the time I was in school and all the time I was in college and much of her life after that. Some of my father&#x27;s lawyers urged him to go into bankruptcy so he could protect what he had, but I&#x27;ve heard him talk about that a lot and say that&#x27;s a dishonest way to do it. So, he paid out all of his creditors and so on, even though most of his debtors didn&#x27;t pay him. P.D.:  So he really had the old-fashioned ethics. Sitterson: That was an old-fashioned view of things. You know, the law would have permitted him to do otherwise. At any rate, then he went to work with an uncle of mine who was an oil distributor there, and then he became postmaster. My family has always been very strongly active in Democratic politics in North Carolina. In fact, the earliest memory I have of politics is when Cameron Morrison who was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1920 stayed with us when he would come to that section of North Carolina on his campaign ing. P.D.:  You would have been 9 or 10 years old? Sitterson: I was born in 1911, you see I would have been 9 years old. I went to high school in Kinston. We had, I thought, a very good public school system in Kinston in those days. We had some very good teachers. I guess some would say I was precocious in the sense that I did skip one grade along the way, so I actually went to secondary school only ten years. We had eleven grades at that time, not twelve. And then when you skip one, that left. ... So that meant, of course, that I was always younger than my classmates. That&#x27;s been true I guess all my life; I&#x27;ve always been younger than whatever group I was in. Now, teachers then were mostly all women. There were very few men teachers in secondary education. I think during the time that I was in secondary school, all the way from first grade until I graduated, I had two male teachers. One taught science in high school and the other one taught Latin. They happened to have both been graduates of Duke, which at that time was Trinity College. They had both been graduates of Trinity. All the rest were women. I had the good fortune of having some superb women teachers. I wouldn&#x27;t call either one of the men a superb teacher, but some of the women were really superb teachers.  And I think they contributed to an interest in having good teachers. We don&#x27;t apparently think much about it anymore; nobody seems to care much about it. But the plain fact of the matter is, that they are the real key people, I think, in people&#x27;s lives, great teachers. I&#x27;m sometimes shocked that we think so little of it now, but I don&#x27;t hesitate to say that they had a great influence over me. P.D. : Is there any one, or two that really stand out? Sitterson: Well, there were a number of them that were very superb teachers. Margaret Pierce, from Weldon was a great history teacher. And Elizabeth Morton was a great English literature teacher. Grace Van Landingham and Mary Grace Wilson were great mathematics teachers. And there were others that over the time demanded a great deal and put a real emphasis on qualitative performance. So much so, that when I came to the University, I felt that I was adequately prepared to do good academic work. A good many people went to boarding schools in those days to get prepared for University education. I did not. I came to the University as a freshman in 1927. Now, when I came at first I did not intend to stay at the University for a full career; I intended to go to the Naval Academy. I had gotten in my mind the idea that I wanted to have a Naval career and after one quarter (we had a quarter system), I transferred. I could see that I wasn&#x27;t getting the kind of concentrated preparation to pass entrance examinations to the Naval Academy. So I dropped out of UNC and moved to Washington in the spring of 1928 to study at a preparatory school for Annapolis and West Point. And I got along all right and took the exams and passed all right, but when I took the physical examination I couldn&#x27;t get in because of a vision defect, so that ended that kind of career. I came back to the University and I went on then in another career. The University in 1927 and Chapel Hill were, as you would imagine, very different places from what they are now. The University&#x27;s total enrollment that year was 2,700; that&#x27;s less than the freshman class now. We had in our class somewhere in the neighborhood of between 900 and 1000 in the freshman class. It was the largest freshman class that had ever been admitted. But again, the University was growing rather rapidly in the 1920s. The University was really a small college until after World War I. We did not reach one thousand students before World War I. In fact, the University was about as large in the 1850s as it was to be for more than a half century thereafter. It was one of the larger American universities in the 1850s, but then, in the half century after that it was a smaller institution. But it grew very rapidly in the 1920s. Now, another interesting thing is this: there was very little pavement in Chapel Hill in those days. Franklin Street had a strip paved down the middle,  but after that it was Chapel Hill gravel and mud. On campus, there were no brick walks; there were only gravel walks. The resident halls--the major resident halls--in those days were Battle, Vance and Pettigrew (which are now used as offices), Old East and Old West, and Steele. And then the &quot;upper quad&quot; and the &quot;lower quad;&quot; because of the four buildings in each group they were called the upper quad and the lower quad. And that was about all of the residence halls.  But most everybody lived on campus. P.D.:  And you lived in . . .? Sitterson: I lived in Old East. During my undergraduate years here I lived in three different dorms, Old East, Old West and Steele, which was then a residence hall. There were very few women on campus, that&#x27;s another thing. We did not admit women here, except as graduate and professional students and junior transfers (there were not many junior transfers however, at that time). There were just a small number, but they gradually increased as the years went along. P.D.: Would they have boarded with families in town? Sitterson: No, the University built a women&#x27;s dorm. Spencer Hall was built, my recollection is that it was built in 1925 or &#x27;26, and that was the residence hall for virtually all of the undergraduate women who came here. By the &#x27;30s they began to increase steadily all the time, until actually we are predominantly a women&#x27;s institution now.  Are you aware of that? P.D.:  We are in the majority everywhere now. Sitterson: Rather substantially here as a matter of fact. I think we&#x27;re now running, in the freshman classes, about 60:40. So, of course, as that goes through an undergraduate generation, it tends to affect the whole. So I think that if we&#x27;re not already, we will be soon a 60:40 ratio. P.D.: Let&#x27;s talk a little bit about your class work and your professors from that period. Sitterson: Well, I was--I would say again--very fortunate in some of my professors at the University. There were, I thought, some excellent professors who had considerable influence over my life. And, while I majored in history I had, I thought, some outstanding professors in several different fields and not merely confined to history. For example, one of the best teachers I ever had was a professor in mathematics named Brown; he was simply a superb, superb teacher. The history department was small in those days, and it was primarily American history, Western European, and Ancient, Classical Civilization. That was, in a sense, the structure of most small history deparments in those days. Now, among those in history, the ones who probably had the most influence over me were Fletcher Green, R.D.W. Conner, Roulhac Hamilton, Whatley Pierson, all of those really in different ways . . . because they were quite different. One of the things about those faculty people was that they were very strong personalities, all of them, but very different, quite different. Their teaching methods were quite different. R.D.W. Conner, for example, was probably as well organized a lecturer as I&#x27;ve ever heard. Pierson was brilliant in his language and he could deliver brilliant lectures. Hamilton was a very opinionated kind of a faculty teacher, but a person who had a wealth of personal knowledge about the South (which he taught), a tremendous amount of personal knowledge about families and about things of that sort. P.D. : So he would bring a lot of color into the lectures . Sitterson:  He would bring a lot of color. P.D.: You say he was opinionated. What do you mean by that? Sitterson: Well, I think he would have ... In his treatment of controversial issues, generally speaking, he would have a very strong view of whatever it was. That&#x27;s what I mean by that. In other words, he would commit himself. You know, a lot of faculty people take the view that they can take a subject on which they have a very strong view and treat it with complete objectivity. In fact, sometimes I have a tendency in my teaching to have a very strong view of a subject. Yet, you can ask students after how I&#x27;ve treated it and some will say, &quot;he believes one thing&quot; and some will say, &quot;he believes the other.&quot; If you were attending one of Hamilton&#x27;s classes, you wouldn&#x27;t have any real doubt about what he thought about it. I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that&#x27;s a bad teaching technique; it might be a very good one. But I think that&#x27;s the way he was. Now, Conner would be very judicious in the way he would handle a subject. The fields that I took most of my work in were history, English and economics, they were the three. Now, I took political science, sociology and so forth, but I didn&#x27;t take very much work in those fields. Political science at that time was a part of the history department. There was &quot;history and government,&quot; that was the department. Again, a pattern that was followed virtually all over the country in those days. But political science developed as an offshoot. We had an outstanding English department here in those days. And I had the good fortune of having some very fine English faculty, Addison Hibbard and George Coffin Taylor, were both superb teachers. In economics I had some very good teachers, Harry Wolfe I think was one of the best and Claudius Murchison was a very able one, and Erich Zimmerman who was superb. They were all three superb faculty. So that gives you some idea about the faculty who I thought were outstanding in those years. Once I knew I was not going into a naval career, then I began to think about what kind of a career would I want. And I kind of turned over in my mind either going into law or going into teaching. And I think really the quality of the history faculty probably influenced me and probably Green more than others. I think it probably contributed. I had never thought about teaching until I was here at the University, in other words it was not something I&#x27;d had in my mind as a youngster. And I came more and more to thinking that&#x27;s the kind of career I wanted to follow. P.D.:  What was it about teaching that . . . Sitterson: Well, of course one thing I think is that I like to read a lot. And I think you&#x27;re not likely, in humanistic fields for example, to be interested in teaching if you don&#x27;t like to read. At least, I can&#x27;t imagine how a person would enjoy a life of teaching if he or she didn&#x27;t like reading. So that had something to do with it. And I liked the people too. They were human beings whose qualities I admired and respected. As I say, they were strong people, all of them . P.D. As an undergraduate, did you have a lot of personal contact with the faculty? Sitterson: Not a great deal out of class. Now, that&#x27;s another interesting thing. You hear a lot of people talk about the old days when there were very close 11 relations between faculty and students. Most of that&#x27;s tommy rot. Society was more structured in those days than it is now and the amount of contact (I&#x27;m talking about undergraduates not graduates now; it changes when you get to be a graduate) you had as an undergraduate really was limited even though the University was small. Classes for the most part were smaller. There still was not a lot of intermixture between faculty . . . The plain fact of the matter was students weren&#x27;t interested in seeing the faculty and the faculty probably weren&#x27;t interested in seeing the student much in social relationships. There&#x27;s a lot more now, even though we&#x27;re a huge University, there&#x27;s a lot more of what I call extracurricular contact between faculty and students, I think. P.D.: In fact, I think there&#x27;s a program so that students can visit faculty in their homes. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right. They have all kinds of ways to promote that. In one sense, since classes were smaller and the University setting was smaller, it wasn&#x27;t as likely that a student would &quot;get lost,&quot; unless he had some kind of extracurricular contact. In other words, you weren&#x27;t really needed as much. I mean, you could talk to professors more or less all the time anyway, not so much socially. I spent lots of time talking with them about my work and the things I was interested in, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about here.   Now, there&#x27;s a lot of social activity that involves faculty and students . P.D.: One thing I think of is E.B. White&#x27;s autobiography. He talks about a couple of professors at Cornell that he regularly went to their homes. There was a sort of standard, once a week get together among a group of students and these particular faculty members. Sitterson: Well, after Frank Graham became president of the University, on Sunday nights he had what he called an &quot;open house&quot; and any students who wanted to could drop by and chat and that kind of thing. And some professors did that. I never did much of that, I did with Frank Graham, but I mean as a faculty member. And by the way, Frank Graham, during my time was a faculty member in the history department. Unfortunately, I did not have a course with him. He was a very famous teacher, but I just didn&#x27;t have that good luck. P.D.:  What did he teach? Sitterson: He taught American history. I just didn&#x27;t happen to get him. But he was a highly regarded teacher. P.D. : How about some of your fellow students, your roommates. What kind of activities were there for you to do? Sitterson: Well, I roomed with two people with whom I had grown up in Kinston. Interestingly enough, they both went into medicine.   They both became doctors and one of them became head of surgery at Temple University later on. P.D.:  What was his name? Sitterson: His name was George Rosemond. And the other one was Henry Temple and he went back to Kinston. We had a two year medical school here then. You&#x27;d take the basic science years here, then transfer for your clinical education to other institutions. George transferred to Temple and Henry transferred to Pennsylvania. And after they finished, they persued different careers: George stayed on the faculty at Temple and Henry went back to his home town (our home town) to practice medicine. Henry died some ten years or so ago and George has retired and still lives in the Philadelphia area. Now, other good friends that I had were Joe Eagles who was from Wilson, Clyde Dunn who was also from Kinston and Lawrence London from Pittsboro. These people are all retired from whatever activities they were in. I can think of large numbers of people that I knew, but these were the people that I was closest to over time. P.D.: These are people you&#x27;ve stayed in touch with over the years as well? Sitterson: Yes, I&#x27;ve stayed in touch with them. And particularly Lawrence London. He lives in Chapel Hill. We had a longer continuous relationship because he went into graduate history work also.  So we had a longer continuous, uninterrupted relationship probably than anybody. And we&#x27;re still very close. So we&#x27;ve been close friends for 55 years, which is quite a long time. Then, I did go on in graduate study. Probably I would have left here and gone north to graduate study if I&#x27;d had any money. I think the difference in the support for graduate students then and now is one of the most striking and yet you never hear much comment on that. There was very little support for graduate students and that was true everywhere in the country. There was more, obviously, at Harvard or Yale than there would have been at Chapel Hill, but even so limited amounts. And I would say that it was extraordinarily unusual for a graduate student to enter a graduate program and stay in it until he or she graduated. Because generally speaking we had to stop to work for money. P.D.: How about with your undergraduate level work. Did you have to work . . . Sitterson: No, I didn&#x27;t. My family was able to send me. Now I don&#x27;t want to leave the impression that I had plenty of money, because I didn&#x27;t. I lived economically and it didn&#x27;t cost very much to go to college in those days. P.D.: Do you have any recollection about how much we&#x27;re talking about? Sitterson: Sure. We&#x27;re talking about between six hundred and one thousand dollars, roughly.   I think you 15 could come to Chapel Hill and live comfortably on one thousand dollars; you could get by on six or seven hundred. P.D.:  Your father was a postmaster? Sitterson: No, not at that time. That came later on. No, at that time he was working with my uncle who was in the oil distributor business. P.D.:  And your mother was teaching? Sitterson: My mother was teaching, that&#x27;s right, piano. [END OF TAPE I, SIDE i] P.D.: Could you run through your brother and sister and their educations briefly? Sitterson: Well, I was the oldest and then my sister, Lavinia. She chose to pursue art education, rather than go to a traditional college and she went to New York to study art. But I think retrospectively that was a mistake, to send an immature young girl into that unstructured situation in New York. P.D. : You said she was sixteen or seventeen years old? Sitterson: Seventeen, not over seventeen. I think it didn&#x27;t work out best for her, as time was to indicate. She married up there, then was divorced, then married again   and had  three marriages and no  children.   She later came back to Kinston and lived with my mother in the later years of her life; they had a duplex and one lived in one side and one lived in the other, which worked out very nicely for both at that time, because mother needed someone and Lavinia needed somewhere to go and 1ive. My brother came here [to UNC] to college and took a business degree and became a Certified Public Accountant. He graduated right on the eve of World War II, worked in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then went into the Navy. Just after WWII, he went into the firm of some younger accountants in Raleigh (which proved to be a very successful firm), but he wanted to go back to his hometown. So he did and established his firm, which has also been a very successful firm over the years, and he&#x27;s had a very successful career in public life there. He was on the city council and he was mayor for some eighteen years and just stopped that phase of his life a year or two ago. But he&#x27;s been very active in the civic life of that community. And, as I indicated, my mother&#x27;s family were from that section of eastern North Carolina and she was one of, let&#x27;s see, seven or eight: two brothers and either five or six sisters. So that meant that I had lots of cousins. P.D.:  Now, your mother&#x27;s maiden name is Mitchell? Sitterson: Mitchell, that&#x27;s right. And my grandmother&#x27;s maiden name was Perry. So there are lots of relatives. If I go into second and third cousins I would have lots of them. We don&#x27;t pay too much attention to that, but nevertheless there are lots of them living in that area . Now, my grandfather, on my mother&#x27;s side is a Mitchell--a name that comes from Granville County. And part of that family is still in Granville County, but I don&#x27;t really even know any of them with the exception of a cousin, Fanny Mitchell, who was for many years Director of Placement at Duke University. . This is a good illustration of what happened after the Civil War. My grandfather on my mother&#x27;s side left Granville County--he was apparently one of the younger brothers and he just left Granville County--and settled in Kinston where he began to deal in mules and had a livery stable. And my grandmother was a Perry and she came from a big landholding family in that area.   So when they married . and he made lots of money. But the interesting thing about it was, he had very little contact with the family he had left. That probably happened more than we realize because transportation and communication were a lot more difficult; there were few roads. Now we&#x27;d say today, well between Oxford and Kinston that&#x27;s no trouble: you get in a car and you drive over there and two or three hours later you&#x27;re there.   That wasn&#x27;t true at the time we&#x27;re talking about, you&#x27;re talking about two or three days of laborious travel. So it was completely separate worlds and very little movement between them. P.D.: North Carolina was notorious for it&#x27;s bad roads . Sitterson: In those days. You see, I&#x27;m talking about the 1860s and &#x27;70s. But that gives you some of the family background. Now, let&#x27;s see, we&#x27;re virtually down through undergraduate education, which would be 1931. P.D.: I have one other question. What kinds of extra-curricular activities were you a part of? Were you involved in any debate, or any of that sort of thing? Sitterson: Well, in those days the literary societies were more important than they are now. And we had two, the Di and the Phi; now they are combined, the Di Phi. I belonged to the Phi, which met in New East, on the top floor of New East. The Di met on the top floor of New West. And there was a tradition that eastern North Carolinians--generally, not always, but generally--were members of the Phi, and western North Carolinians were members of the Di. And we met one night a week and we always had some topic for discussion. So I participated in that a good bit. You&#x27;d go, and everybody could speak. P.D.:  Did somebody prepare a paper? Sitterson: Well, generally speaking, there would be someone who would open the discussion.   But that was a useful kind of thing and it really is kind of regrettable that it doesn&#x27;t function more today, because it was good practice in organizing your thoughts and expressing yourself and that kind of thing. I guess people expect to learn more of that in public speaking now, but public speaking was not that much a part of the curriculum in those days.  But the literary societies were. Another important part of undergraduate extracurricular activities was the Y.M.C.A. I was active in the &quot;Y&quot; and in fact, I led biblical discussions. We&#x27;d have a meeting in Gerard Hall once a week and different people would have a section of the scripture they&#x27;d read and comment on and interpret. I did some of that. I did not belong to a fraternity, so I wasn&#x27;t heavily involved in campus social life, as distinct from extracurricular things that I&#x27;ve described. P.D.: Was that a big part of life, generally, on campus, fraternities? Sitterson: Yes, much more so then than now, because the institution was smaller and fraternities made up a larger percentage, let&#x27;s say, of students. Now, they represent a very small percentage. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of social life involving girls on campus, most of the time, but the Order of the Grail to which I belonged (that&#x27;s an honorary society), had Saturday night dances. And they had them in Bynum Hall; at that time that was the old gym, we didn&#x27;t have any other gym. We had the &quot;tin can.&quot; But that was the old gym, Bynum was, and on the floor we would have rather famous dances, because they provided really about the only boy-girl social life on campus. And we had Grail dances about one Saturday night a month. They cost $1.00, so that meant most everybody could go who wanted to go.  You&#x27;d have dates, either coeds or &quot;imports.&quot; P.D.:  Somebody from your home town? Sitterson: Or somebody who was at the woman&#x27;s college in Greensboro, or somebody who was at St. Mary&#x27;s or Meredith in Raleigh. You see, nearby women&#x27;s schools. They were really a lot of fun and something the campus needed. One of the main purposes of the Grail was to promote such worthy causes as scholarships. All of the money that was made out of the dances went into the Grail Scholarships. There was a great emphasis on the University providing scholarships and work opportunities for those who needed it. In those days, the federal government was not in it, nor was the state. So it&#x27;s just what people were given--scholarships--and what people could make. P.D.: You say as an undergraduate, you didn&#x27;t work. Did any of your classmates? Sitterson: Yes, yes, a good many of them did, although I would say the majority of them did not. What percentage did,  I  just couldn&#x27;t tell you.   Of course, there weren&#x27;t  as  many  working  opportunities  in  Chapel Hill then as there are now. P.D.: Were there many jobs on campus that students could do? Sitterson: Yes, there were some jobs on campus. Of course, you didn&#x27;t have the big campus maintenance of the size that you have now. They worked downtown in the restaurants, a few restaurants. We didn&#x27;t have many restaurants then--only two or three. And the theatre. You could work there taking up tickets in the theatre. There was lots of yard work you could do for faculty people who lived in town. Those were the kinds of jobs you could have. P.D. :  Let&#x27;s go on to your graduate career. Sitterson: Well, by the time I had decided to go on to graduate work, I had to think about how I was going to get the money to go to graduate school. And it turned out that the Social Science Research Council had decided to provide funds for graduate fellowships for southerners. And I applied for one and developed a project. I had to get a topic that I felt would be of interest to them and so I started working on the sugar industry in the South. And I did a little bit of that in my senior year in college, enough to develop a project to present to them. And I was lucky enough to get a grant from them. The grant was $500. Now, again, that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot of money in terms of today&#x27;s grants, but if I decided to come here and start graduate work, I could do it on $500 and a little more that I might make during the summer. You see, I could get by. And that&#x27;s where I started. And after a year, I got a master&#x27;s degree but then I didn&#x27;t have any more money so I decided I would teach for a year. I got a job--I was lucky because jobs were extraordinarily difficult to get in 1932--in a boys military preparatory school in Georgia. And I taught for a year there. Then I applied for a teaching fellowship. There were three teaching fellowships in the history department and they paid $500 a year, plus tuition. That was all the department had to subsidize anybody going to graduate school. P.D.: How many graduate students were there in your class then? Sitterson:  Well, there were about thirty-five. P.D.:  And only three of them really got any subsidy Sitterson: That&#x27;s right, from the University. So I got a teaching fellowship and I came back. But at that time the department had a policy that it would not renew a teaching fellowship. You had it one year. So at the end of that year, I had to drop out again. I was very, very lucky. I got a job with the Department of Archives and History in Raleigh. Dr. Conner got that job for me. And  I  went over  there to work and  I  ran the Hall  of History, as it was then called. It was the Historical Museum. And I really set up the system. They sent me around to some museums to see what they were doing, then I set up their system. They tell me they still use the same classification system now. P.D.:  They didn&#x27;t really have an organized museum. Sitterson: They had a museum but they didn&#x27;t have adequate records of the items in it. So it was a haphazard mess when I went over there. I spent about a year doing that. They were reorganizing the curriculum over here. You see, I&#x27;d been to graduate school for two years: &#x27;31-&#x27;32, then I taught &#x27; 32-&#x27; 33 , then I was back here &#x27;33-&#x27;34, then I went to Raleigh &#x27;34-&#x27;35. But then, at that time, there was a great program of reorganization of undergraduate education going on around the country. A lot of that is going on now. Well, part of that was the establishment of what was called a freshman social science course, to be taught by faculty composed of historieans, political scientists, economists, and sociologists. Now, they were just setting it up and they were assembling the faculty for it. Now, Albert Ray Newsome (who later became head of the department of history here) was the head of the Department of Archives and History in Raleigh. And I worked with him. He was invited to come back here and become chairman of the department. The department,  in those two years,  changed drastically in it&#x27;s composition. Let me tell you just a little bit about that. Conner left to become National Archivist. Hamilton stopped teaching to become director of the Southern Historical Collection, which he&#x27;d already established and was working on part time. I&#x27;ll tell you, as a matter of fact, the courses I was taking with Hamilton were always taught at 8:00 in the morning. Then he&#x27;d take that little Ford and start throughout the state collecting papers. So you didn&#x27;t see much of Hamilton unless you were in his class at that time, so he was moving out of the department. Fletcher Green left and went to Emory for a few years. Frank Graham had become President of the University. Whatley Pierson was Dean of the Graduate School. So there was a great turnover in personnel in the department during the early 1930&#x27;s. And Newsome came back over here. I applied for a part-time ins truetorship. And I got one and I taught one section of freshman social science and continued graduate study until I finished my degree in 1937. Meanwhile I had shifted subjects and I worked on the secession movement in North Carolina. I shifted subjects largely because I didn&#x27;t have enough money to go into the lower South and do field research, which I had to do to finish the work. So I picked a subject where I could work in the sources available here. So, while I was working in the Department of Archives and History in 25 the daytime, I worked at night doing research on my dissertation. So I had done a lot of research; in fact, I had covered all the North Carolina newspapers; there was a marvelous collection in the State Library there, and I had a key so I could go in and work at night. P.D.:  Fringe benefits. Sitterson: Fringe benefits, that&#x27;s right. So I got a lot done. You get the impression that . . . You know, I didn&#x27;t want it to drag on too long, because it was costly, it was hard and there was no money that was going to be handed out to help me get through. It worked out all right. I got my degree in 1937 and I had become interested in a young girl at that time and we were married, a marriage that lasted only three years. We were divorced in 1939 or there-abouts. I think we should talk a little bit more about graduate school. [END TAPE I, SIDE ii.  BEGIN TAPE II, SIDE i] P.D.: The date of this interview is February 22, 1985. This is a continuation of the February 19, 1985 interview with Carlyle Sitterson. We are in his office in Hamilton Hall on the UNC campus. This is tape 2, side i. What I wanted to clear up was the dates of your father&#x27;s work. You mentioned he went into the wholesale business . Sitterson: When I was growing up he was a wholesaler. P.D.:  What was it he was selling? Sitterson: Well, it was groceries, ice cream, and a bottled softdrinks and ice. He had a fairly large operation. And that would have been from the time before I was born on until, I would say, around the mid 1920s, somewhere in the neighborhood of &#x27;24 or &#x27;25. Then he went to work with my uncle, one of my mother&#x27;s brothers. P.D.:  What was his name? Sitterson: Mitchell, Courtney Mitchell. That was sometime in the mid or late 1920s, but I&#x27;m not absolutely sure of the exact date. I find now that I don&#x27;t remember. I can remember what periods these things happened, but when you try to get me down to a specific date, it&#x27;s not always easy. P.D.: I can understand that. I have to figure out how old my daughter was at that time, in order to figure out dates. Sitterson:  It won&#x27;t get better. [Laughter] P.D.:   [Laughter]   That&#x27;s what worries me:   I&#x27;m a y histori^an and I&#x27;m terrible with dates.   Even my own. O.K.   I just wanted to be a little clearer on that.  So let&#x27;s go back to graduate school.   One of the comments you  made  last  Tuesday  was  that  you  were  in  graduate school just before things really changed and grew in the department . Sitterson: Yes. I believe I told you that the number of graduate students was somewhere in the thirties. Now, there are two or three striking differences, I think, about graduate enrollment then and graduate enrollment now. I think we ought to talk about that. In the first place, very few graduate students were women.  There were a few then. P.D.:  Were there any in the history department? Sitterson: Yes, there were several. But I would say, clearly, three-fourths to nine-tenths were male. Now the second difference, of course, is that during those times all southern higher education institutions were racially segregated. That meant there were no blacks in the graduate school or professional school here at the University before World War II. So, I think we have to keep those two things in mind all the time as we talk about the composition of graduate enrollment. Now again, the graduate function of the history department (and this was true, I think, of most departments) was quantitatively a much smaller proportion of the total educational functions than it is today, we&#x27;ll say. I think I&#x27;ve already commented on the fact that the history department was a small department. And it was much easier for everybody in the department, more or less, to know one another and to see one another fairly frequently, which is not true in our day. P.D.:  How many were on the faculty? Sitterson: I would say that there probably were a dozen full time faculty members. And, of course, there were some part-time people who were teaching freshman courses. P.D.: These were part-time instructors, someone who was A.B.D.? Sitterson: That&#x27;s correct. For example, I was a part-time instructor.  And there were many others. P.D.: So that was about the one form of financial aid that the department would provide? Sitterson: That&#x27;s right, other than the three fellowships. Once we put in the freshman social science course in the mid-30s, we had to staff that. And again, as you know, using graduate students is an economy measure as well as providing an opportunity for them to get teaching experience and complete their graduate studies.  And we had very able people. One thing about the 30s. When you have periods of bad market conditions (not many jobs and so on), it means somehow though, that you have access to some very able people that you might not otherwise have access to. I never felt, for example, that the quality of those students--particularly in the late 30s--was low because they didn&#x27;t have their doctoral degrees. They were very able people indeed. P.D.: People would stay on a bit longer perhaps than if there had been a good job out there. Sitterson: Some of them were extraordinar1ily able, who went on, after they eventually left here, to good appointments in major institutions and so it wasn&#x27;t really a low quality. P.D.: Can you think of who some of those good students were? Sitterson: Oh yes, Harry Moore, a sociologist. He went on to the University of Texas where he was a very esteemed sociologist. Political scientist Arthur Dugan (he had been a Rhodes Scholar) who went on to the University of the South where he was a professor there for a good while. Not to be immodest, I went on to my appointment here. Jim Godfrey was one of those, although he was not getting his degree here--he was getting it from Chicago--but he hadn&#x27;t received his degree and didn&#x27;t receive it until 1942 or &#x27;43. That&#x27;s an illustration of about four or five. And there were several more. There was one in economics, Alan Bonell, who went on to become the head of one of the institutions in Pennsy1vania--I&#x27;ve forgotten which one.  That&#x27;s about all I can think of. P.D.: So you were part of this interdisciplinary team teaching freshman social science. Sitterson: Yes, I was. There was a committee responsible for that. This committee included the heads of history, economics, sociology, and political science. And then they had an executive secretary, Carl Pegg, who is now an emeritus professor in the history department, who actually administered the course. It was a fairly close-knit staff in the sense that we were constantly appraising the course all the time. The staff met regularly, at least once a month, and we were sharing our teaching experiences all the time, changing the composition of each topic. You see, we didn&#x27;t have a single textbook and we wrote a syllabus together; we kept changing each year. That may have contributed to the vitality ... it became a very highly regarded undergraduate course. P.D.: How was it set up? Would you take turns lecturing in your various fields? Sitterson: No, each one of us was responsible for his own class. We tried to keep classes small. Our objective was to try to have classes in the general range of 30 class members. We didn&#x27;t use the large lecture with the discussion sections. We didn&#x27;t do any of that at that time. The idea was that every student in the course should have a relationship with his instructor, full time.  And it seemed to go reasonably well. P.D.: So you&#x27;d each teach your own class, but you&#x27;d be integrating new material perspectives from the other courses . Sitterson: That&#x27;s correct, that&#x27;s right. And in the discussions of how topics were going to be presented, everyone would share in that preparation. P.D.:   It does sound like you&#x27;d make a much broader Sitterson: Well, I think of course what it meant was--allowing for the obvious differences of individuals and their teaching techniques--it really meant that there was a common theme in each assignment. In other words, whether you were in this man&#x27;s course (again, there weren&#x27;t any women teaching at that time), or that person&#x27;s course, at the end of the course there would be a common body of knowledge. That&#x27;s not so true today, unless you have that same kind of continuing association of staff. P.D. : How long did you continue as a part time instructor? Sitterson: Not very long. In fact, I was a part time instructor really only one semester, and then I became a full time instructor. One of our staff members--a very able young fellow named Dan Lacey (he and I went to school together and he left school to head up the state records and he went on and never did come back to finish his degree) went on to a very successful career in National Records Administration--and then I was asked if I wanted to take a full time instructorship. I really had finished everything except concluding my dissertation. I had taken my preliminaries and writtens. In fact I had finished all of that before I went to Raleigh.   I was through with everything except finishing my dissertation.  I finished the dissertation at the end of the next year. P.D.: And this was on the secession in North Carolina? Sitterson: I took the Ph.D. in 1937. I started in &#x27;35, and I became a full time instructor. We had a quarter system then, you see, that was the fall quarter. I really started as a full time faculty member, even though I had not received my Ph.D. P.D.: They&#x27;ve just put through a new graduate curriculum here, this year. What sort of curriculum difference in the program do you see? Sitterson: Well, in the first place, at that time, the graduate curriculum was less specialized than it is now. That is, if a person took a degree in American History, it was expected that whether you worked in the recent period, or the colonial period, or wherever you worked, you would have a competent knowledge of all the periods. In your oral and written examinations, you would cover them all. But in addition to that, you were required to have a minor in another field of history, or you could have a double minor, which I did. I had economics as my major minor field. But I took a couple of graduate courses in sociology and also took some graduate courses in statistics, because I had to use statistics and I wanted to know how statistics worked. So, at that time I was exploring the relationship between economics and history. And now that&#x27;s a great, big field. At that time, it was very rare for anybody to be doing much work in that kind of thing. P.D.: I was just going to comment that statistics has become a . . . Sitterson:  Sure, quantitative history . . . P.D.: Yes, quantitative is the thing, some people have told me, and . Sitterson: Well, I did a good bit of that at an elementary level, as compared to what it is now, but nevertheless it was . P.D.:  You must have been a pioneer at that time. Sitterson: Ir was a pioneer at that time, that&#x27;s right. You&#x27;ll find in some of my studies--and that was especially true of Sugar Country and it&#x27;s also true of some of my other research. As a matter of fact, one of the real frustrations I have now is that I have so much quantitative data from several years ago, that I can&#x27;t make much heads or tails of it now, because I&#x27;ve been doing something else for twenty or more years. And it&#x27;s not easy to get that back together. Back to while I was in the graduate program. Since there were not so many graduate students in the program at that time, it wasn&#x27;t structured as much (although graduate students claim it&#x27;s not structured now). We didn&#x27;t have separate courses,  for example, for graduate students. Most of the content courses that graduate students took in those days were all what we would call the &quot;100&quot; level courses. There weren&#x27;t any &quot;200&quot; level graduate courses, except the seminars. You had historiography, which everybody took, and then you had your seminars, and the rest of the courses were all in the hundred bracket. P.D.: Did you do extra work because you were a graduate student? Sitterson: Yes, you had more reading and that sort of thing, reasearch papers to write. But they were all put together. Now, that wasn&#x27;t unique to Carolina (UNC); it was also true of the other major graduate institutions of the country. That was true at Harvard, for example. There weren&#x27;t any separate content courses for graduate students; it was assumed that the level was one in which both graduate and undergraduate students could benefit. P.D.:  Who taught the historiography course? Sitterson: Wallace Caldwell. He was an ancient historian. He was a big shot in his field, also. He was a very interesting person, and had an extraordinary range of knowledge over the fields. That tended to be more true, I think, of people of that generation. And all graduate students getting their Ph.D. were required to take at least one course in every field that the department offered. So that meant I had to take a course in  ancient  history,  a  course  in  medieval  history,  a course in British history, a course in Latin American history. But they were required of us. The purpose of that was to give the graduate student not any extensive knowledge, obviously, but to give him a sense of perspective in looking at his own field. And also, to give him some bibliographical acquaintance, because the assumption was, when you got a job, you were not going to be a specialist; but you would be called upon to teach broad courses. And frankly, I think, practically it had a great deal of value. It had a great deal of value for me because I had an opportunity to read in fields that I would have never spent the time studying, and get acquainted with people and the kind of work that was going on in those fields. So it was a really useful part of graduate education. So that&#x27;s roughly what the graduate requirements were. We had the same general examination requirements. That is, we had the preliminary oral, the doctoral written examination, then we had the final oral. The final oral tended to be a little bit more substantial than they have been recently. The department has such a great number of graduate students, that it&#x27;s gotten down to almost entirely a defense of the dissertation. They were somewhat broader back then. P.D.: So, then you&#x27;d be asked to discuss in more than one area? Sitterson: You&#x27;d be asked to do everything except your minor. In other words, if you were in U.S. history, you&#x27;d have the whole field of U.S. history; there was a substantive examination, not just an examination of your dissertation. But that&#x27;s about it. I guess you&#x27;d have to say that a big change began to come as the G.I. generation came into graduate studies after World War II. That was a kind of a mushrooming in size, and an extraordinary development in the quality also. P.D. : Did that have an immediate impact on graduate, as well as undergraduates. Did you have a lot of people coming back? Sitterson:  Yes, yes, we did. P.D.: And you were, by that time right after the war, promoted to full professor? Sitterson: No I wasn&#x27;t promoted to full professor until after the war. I was promoted to assistant professor before the war. Another thing I might tell you, because it&#x27;s interesting, is this. Today, everyone that gets a degree expects to start as an assistant professor. That was not true in those days at all. I had a Ph.D. as an instructor, George Mowry, who came here from Wisconsin, had his degree as an instructor, C. Vann Woodward was here. He left to go to Florida as an instructor. It was just routine in those days to serve one through three or four years as an instructor, even though you had your degree. P.D.: Now if you do that at all, you&#x27;re just visiting a class. Sitterson: Generally speaking, if a person has a Ph.D. degree in the academic world, you&#x27;d expect that person to have a rank above instructor. Now, whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not is a different question. What it does is greatly shorten the time in which tenure decisions are made. You can get a positive result and you can think it&#x27;s a good thing; you can get a negative result and think it&#x27;s not a fair way to operate the system. And there&#x27;s some truth. I feel that hardly any profession makes lifetime decisions on people on the basis of such a limited time span as we do in the academic world. P.D. : But how long does it take to know if a person is a good teacher or researcher? Sitterson: Well, from the standpoint of potentiality of what we might call important research achievements, I think it takes longer than say, 6 years, which is about what we do now. One of the big questions, and it&#x27;s the key question when you evaluate a person&#x27;s potential as a scholar is not so much what that person does with his or her disser*tation, it&#x27;s what that person does next. Now, if you&#x27;re going to make tenure decisions in the period of five to seven years--which we are now making, and the system calls for it--very rarely can a person have at once completed a dissertation, published it and so on, and shown sufficient initiative in such a short time to demonstrate that that&#x27;s not something the person did because it was required, but that that is a part of the kind of career that person is going to have. So that&#x27;s the real weak point in the system. That&#x27;s not passing judgement on the individuals; the system simply does not provide that kind of opportunity in that period of time. Of course, we didn&#x27;t have any tenure below the rank of professor. The University of North Carolina granted tenure only when a person was promoted to full professor, not prior to that. Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, that&#x27;s still true at Harvard. Harvard is a law unto itself; it doesn&#x27;t have to agree with the AUP or various other things. It does like it pleases. And my recollection is, that the last time I looked into it, that was still true. We adopted a system here which is virtually the same system that the AAUP recommends, namely, you start toward tenure as an assistant professor. You must remember that it&#x27;s not preceded by an ins true torship like it used to be. You see, I was an instructor for three years. So, then you can be reappointed for another term, or, if you&#x27;re promoted it automatically carries tenure. So you can acquire tenure in three years, and no longer than six or seven. P.D.: Does that happen often, or is it only the really exceptional person? Sitterson: Well, I would say that it happens in six years routinely, unless the person is terminated. Now, how many would happen in four years I can&#x27;t say without looking into it, but I would say it would be rare. The chances are that that person would have been reappointed at the same rank without tenure for three years, let&#x27;s say . [END TAPE II, SIDE i] Sitterson: As I indicated, while the graduate program was developed and growing in the 30s, that was really kind of a prelude to the great expansion which took place with the G.I. movement after the war. But there were some people whose names you will know. I&#x27;ve already mentioned Woodward, and Ben Wall (who started his graduate work before the war), of course, Godfrey was there. Pegg preceded me--he got his degree here but long before I was involved so I didn&#x27;t know him at all as a graduate student. But then you come to the generation immediately after the war, you have people like Charles Sellers, George Tindall, Dewey Grantham, Joe Steelman, Frank Rankin. You could just go on and on. The University really became, I would say, a center for graduate studies, primarily in southern history during that period. And we became one of the larger graduate programs in the country, and it was predominantly American History, although we began to expand the scope of our history program rather substantially beginning in the 1950&#x27;s. Now, I think I&#x27;ve given you a sense of the scope of it prior to World War II being primarily American, Modern European and Ancient/Medieval. P.D. But you said you also took some courses in Latin American as well. Sitterson: Oh, yes, yes. Whatley Pierson taught Latin American history. We looked upon Latin American as being a part of the general American field, you see, U.S. and Latin American. Again, in those days graduate school was somewhat more rigid; it wasn&#x27;t as flexible in the two foreign languages. There wasn&#x27;t any business that you could substitute something for one of them. The two foreign languages were French and German. In my case, I was doing research which dealt with Latin America, and I wanted to substitute Spanish for German, because it had more relevance to the field I was doing research in. And the answer to that was, the requirements for the field were German and French. If I needed any other language then I should do that, on top of that, which I had to do. That was just the way the graduate program ran. P.D.: What kind of exam did you have in languages? Would you have to translate an article? Sitterson: Yes, yes. It was administered by the language department, not by the history department. They would give you a section to translate. P.D.: Was it something arbitrary, or something in your field? Sitterson: It wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be in your immediate field, because people other than historians would be taking the reading examination. P.D.: So they didn&#x27;t tailor it to what department you were in. Sitterson: No, they didn&#x27;t tailor it to me. In fact, I think the only way I passed the German exam is because I recognized and started to read what the writer was discussing, so then I knew what he was probably saying. I knew I was never going to use German, I just wanted to pass the German examination. Many of the graduate students failed. I remember the Moores, for example, I told you about Harry, but his wife was a sociology student and she got far ahead of him in persuing her degree because Harry failed to get that German off. He became a very distinguished sociologist but that didn&#x27;t mean that he knew German. P.D.: I would think that German would be more applicable, more relevant, to sociology, particularly at that time. Sitterson: Oh, that&#x27;s quite true. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that all sociologists knew German. I think you could find (going to them right now) that very few of them do . Pamela, I can&#x27;t really think of anything more to say about that period, and I&#x27;ve commented on roughly the direction of change that took place in the department in respect to offerings, and in respect to size of the graduate program. P.D.:  Let&#x27;s go on to your teaching. Sitterson: Of course, I was away a good bit during the war like most people. That was an important part of my life though, because of two things. First, in 1940-41 I had a Rosenwall Fellowship to do research on the sugar industry. And I spent that year in the lower South, with headquarters in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Texas and Florida. And I made a lot of progress in doing the basic research that I was going to need. Then when I came back, the war had started then, you see. And I went into the Army. I couldn&#x27;t get commissioned because I couldn&#x27;t pass the physical requirements. But then, when I was drafted, they just sent me through the Army without any physical examination, which is the interesting way the army proceeded. And then, when I started to go to Officer Candidate School after six months as a private and corporal, they discharged me, saying I shouldn&#x27;t have been in in the first place. So I came back to resume my teaching. But in 1944, Jim Fesler, who was in the political science department had gone to Washington when they started building war and defense agencies asked me to join the War Production Board staff. He&#x27;d become the head of a section which had the responsibility of writing the story of American war production. He called to ask me if I would like to come up there and join them. George Mowry was already there. That appealed to me and I wanted to do it, so I took leave and went up there. P.D.: Was the enrollment in the University down substantially during the war so that . . . Sitterson: Yes and no. We had various naval programs going on. So I was teaching people sent here by the Navy, and other students also. So it didn&#x27;t really go down. We had a pre-flight school here. That was a completely separate organization though. The Navy had what we called the V-12 program; they had all different kinds of programs during the war. Then I went on to Washington and stayed there until the summer of 1946. I stayed there a little over two years in that function. And as I said that was an important period because it gave me an acquaintance with a whole different world from the academic world. And also an acquaintance with one of the most important problems in the nation, namely, how does it really marshall all of it&#x27;s resources to carry on a war. I had an opportunity to do a lot of specialized policy analysis studies in which we tried to judge how well the kinds of economic controls worked effectively to produce war goods without seriously crippling the nation&#x27;s economy. We did that, and did it well, I think. That had not been done during World War I, but had it been done, the whole task of getting the United States ready would have been easier this time. The assumption is that if we have to do it again, all of that will be of extraordinary value. I think it&#x27;s probably true. But I came back in the summer of 1946. By that time, I had remarried. I think I mentioned that I was first married in 1936, but we separated in 1939. Had no children from the first marriage. P.D.:  What was your first wife&#x27;s name? Sitterson: Her name was Nancy Flanders. My second marriage came in 1944 and I married Nancy Howard from Kinston , N.C. P.D.: You say that your work in Washington during the war--being outside the academic life--was valuable. But, was that experience an enriching experience? Did you bring things back that you expected to bring back? Sitterson: Yes, I think it was an enriching experience and I think it enriched my teaching and my research, both. And it also resulted in a considerable shifting in my research. You see, I&#x27;d been primarily interested in pre-Civil War history up until that time. And I became much more interested in post-Civil War history. My teaching increasingly went in that direction, and also into economic history.   For a long 45 time I did all the economic history in the direction of the graduate students working in that field, until I got into administration. And that happened sooner than I expected . I had hardly finished the sugar cane study in &#x27;53, before I was asked to chair a committee to study the organization and function of the University. And after we finished that study, I was asked to become Dean of Arts and Sciences and I agreed to do that, and that began 17 years of administration. I never stopped teaching, but I had to reduce my teaching in the fields I was responsible for. I kept on with graduate students until I became Chancellor. The graduate students I still had I finished. But I didn&#x27;t take on any more graduate students initially, after 1966, until I came back to the department in 1972. When I came back I took a few master&#x27;s candidates, and undergraduate honors students, but I decided that it wouldn&#x27;t be productive for me to start people who were going through to the doctorate level, because of the number of years involved and the many responsibilities a director has to take toward placement, and so on. And the time span was getting short. Not only that, but while I was Chancellor, we brought George Mowry here primarily to direct graduate students in recent U.S. history. And so there really wasn&#x27;t any great need for somebody  else  to  do  it  also.  I  gave  up  my  graduate seminar but taught the junion-senior courses in that field, and Mowry did the graduate seminar and directed, the doctoral students. P.D.: I have gathered from talking to people, that you were considered to be a very good teacher. And I gather also that you enjoyed teaching. Sitterson:  I love it, just love it. P.D.: Why then, did you go into administration? Particularly since, as you say, it was much sooner than you could have planned? Sitterson: Well, I never planned to go into it. And when you ask why I did, it&#x27;s not an easy question to answer. Well, in the first place, I thought that I could influence the quality of undergraduate education. I believed that very strongly after I had done that University education report. You see, one of the points of that report was, at that time, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences was an essential nonentity. He had no authority over personnel in the College at all. The authority came solely from the Chairman of the department. From there it went all the way to the Chancellor, and nobody really was exercising any real responsible leadership to have a qualitative impact on undergraduate education. I came here as an undergraduate and I wanted the undergraduate college to be better. And when they asked me, I didn&#x27;t immediately say, well sure this is something I&#x27;m just waiting to do. It had never occurred to me. But I had already seen the need in that study. I knew that there was a vital need. P.D. :  It needed to be done. Sitterson: It needed to be done and nobody else was doing it.  That&#x27;s correct.  Nobody was doing it. P.D.: That&#x27;s the danger in pointing out changes that are necessary. Sitterson: And, to be honest, I think I did it. In the ten years that I was Dean I think that this undergraduate college was transformed from an ordinary state university undergraduate college into a highly regarded, qualitative program. And I&#x27;ll give you the reasons for that. One, there was virtually no honors program in 1954. We created an extensive honors program with honors sections in the freshman year, awarding many degrees with honors (which we still do). In the second place, we introduced qualitative admissions standards to the University (the Dean of Arts and Sciences is Chairman of the Admissions Committee). There were none at that time. It was open admissions. Anybody with a highlschool diploma. During that period of time we greatly transformed it. Now, to be sure, I had some advantages. The Morehead Program had just been established, so there were a lot of recruiting opportunities to emphasize the qualitative aspect of the undergraduate college.  It also gave me an opportunity to influence faculty appointments, and faculty rewards. A Dean (if he wants to) of a College can greatly influence the quality of undergraduate education through the way in which he communicates to the chairmen of departments as to what values he wants emphasized. He&#x27;s got that money; he can do it. P.D.: Could you clarify for me a little bit more the responsibilities of the chairman of the department and the Dean. Sitterson: Well, the Dean has complete control of raises, money and that kind of thing. And the chair recommends. But for example, if the Dean says, &quot;I hear that this part of your program is really not getting the kind of emphasis that it deserves, or the quality of instruction that it requires, and I want you to address that problem.&quot; You can get a response. But without that power over the budget, the Dean&#x27;s office has limited influence. You may say, well doesn&#x27;t it follow that the chairperson is going to be more interested in educational quality than the Dean&#x27;s office. But it doesn&#x27;t follow always that the chairperson is necessarily interested in everything that the Dean is interested in. In fact, that chairperson may be interested only in the graduate program. That&#x27;s easy, because we&#x27;re all specialists in certain fields, so it&#x27;s perfectly easy to be interested in graduate work.   I said all along, you don&#x27;t have to 49 worry about the graduate program; it&#x27;ll largely take care of itself. That&#x27;s about the only thing most faculty are interested in. You don&#x27;t need to worry about that. But you&#x27;d better worry about the quality of your undergraduate college if you want a good one. Of course, a lot of people don&#x27;t care whether they have a good one or not; I, as well as others, happen to care. P.D . : So, while the chairman of the department may be interested in hiring someone who is good with graduate students and does great research and who has got showy publications, the Dean may be more interested in the quality of his teaching. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right. And how effective he is in really changing and influencing the lives of people. Now, people talk about the Dean being unimportant, but the plain fact of the matter is that if you look at the University of North Carolina and it&#x27;s influence over the public life of North Carolina, it didn&#x27;t come as a result of the Ph . D. s here; it came as a result of the Bachelor of Arts. And you can go around to them, and they&#x27;ll all tell you their lives were changed by their education. Now I happen to believe that. And my gosh, I&#x27;ve seen it through my whole life. There are just so many, many, people that are all over everywhere. I can see them everywhere. One time when I was doing a lot of travelling for the University, people would talk to me in airports and tell me,  &quot;You know,  I&#x27;ll never forget the course I took with you at such-and-such a time,&quot; and that goes on all the time. P.D.:  That&#x27;s very rewarding. Sitterson: I came out of the basketball game Wednesday night, and this man came up to me and shook hands and said, &quot;You won&#x27;t remember me,&quot; and he gave his name. He said, &quot;I was in your class. I remember when you were trying to explain to me the gold standard and the effects of the change.&quot; And then this youngster, walking along with him (who was his son) said, &quot;Yes, and I can remember when you were explaining the Vietnamese War to me in my class.&quot; You see, there were two generations that just happened to be represented in that conversation. But that goes on really, all the time. And it&#x27;s very rewarding to me. But I think (as the Dean) I did what our study said should be done. Now it goes on routinely. Everyone knows, for example, that the Dean of the college has tremendous power over the budget but he didn&#x27;t in 1955 when I started.  He didn&#x27;t have any. P.D.: So you made a real change there that you think has had long range effects. So it was worth cutting back on the teaching? Sitterson: Well, I think it was worth it. Yes, I kept on teaching one course all the time. In fact I did all the way through, while I was chancellor also. I taught one course.   I taught recent U.S.,  20th-century. 51 At that time we didn&#x27;t have two courses in the 20th-century. We didn&#x27;t develop two courses, really, until the time after I became the Chancellor. We developed History 114 and 115. Prior to 1966 we had History 114, and that was all. [END OF TAPE II, SIDE ii] Sitterson: Let me give you an illustration of how, practically, a Dean can have influence. When we would have salary increases, for example, and I would decide the total amount of salary monies and how much would go to this department and how much to that department, then, you can be sure that that department is going to make it&#x27;s recommendations. But I tried, through my staff--I had advisors with whom I constantly talked--to get some perception of the effectiveness that the departments were having in their programs, and also the effectiveness of certain faculty in them. In other words, people should be looked at all the time, and the departments were looking at them, to be sure, but also I was looking at them from a somewhat different point of view. Both points of view are important; now don&#x27;t misunderstand me. I think it&#x27;s a great mistake to try to get scholarship and teaching combatting one another. But it&#x27;s very important that neither one be lost sight of. And it&#x27;s easy sometimes for either one of them to be lost sight of, depending upon the point of view of the evaluators. So it was my responsibility to see that the undergraduate teaching functioned at the optimum. Now, in respect to appointments, I had an advisory committee. I never made or approved a major appointment that the Dean of the Graduate school didn&#x27;t himself approve also. So there wasn&#x27;t any sense of the college and the graduate school being [in conflict]. Quite the contrary: we would be mutually supportive. Now, in the review of salaries and promotions, this happened every now and then--not often, I hasten to add, but occasionally--when I would ask a chairman to come in with all of his recommendations, and we would discuss each individual and the basis for the chair&#x27;s evaluation. Now that has a salutary effect upon the chairperson, to have to do that. It enforces a degree of care and responsibility. In other words, the chairman has to say, the reason this person received monetary reward is because so-and-so; the reason this one did not is because so-and-so. And I think that&#x27;s important, highly important. Not just to send in some list and, without any knowledge, just incorporate that in and send it on with approval. You asked about my teaching. Well, I&#x27;ve loved teaching, as I&#x27;ve indicated. I think there are really two requisites to good teaching: one is interest. If you&#x27;re  not  interested,  you  are  not  likely  to  be effective. The second thing is aptitude. The two things together: if you have aptitude and you&#x27;re interested you will be good. This, of course, presumes knowledge of the field. P.D.:  Can you learn the aptitude? Sitterson: That&#x27;s a good question. I don&#x27;t think the question has ever been definitively answered by people who study what constitutes good teaching. Perhaps not. I don&#x27;t know the answer. I do think you&#x27;ve got to have the interest, I really do. P.D.: A corollary to my question is this: should graduate student schools try to teach graduate students how to teach? Sitterson: Well, I&#x27;d put it in a somewhat different way. I think graduate schools should provide an opportunity for graduate students, as a part of their total educational experience, to have some teaching experience. Now I think there are two ways that can be done. Putting the person actually in some classroom experience, whether it be discussion section, whether it be lecturing to a class, that type of thing. But also, in a sense, by having the graduate students attend the classes of the courses they are monitoring, or serving as discussion leaders, as distinct from the courses they are taking. That&#x27;s a little bit different. You see, many people say, &quot;Well, what&#x27;s the difference? I&#x27;m taking the courses,  I  know all  these professors,  so  I&#x27;m  learning that.&quot; But no. There are two different functions going on. And I think this opportunity can and should be provided for graduate students. P.D.: But beyond that, you don&#x27;t think that necessarily there should be a formal course or anything of that nature? Sitterson: I&#x27;m not sure about that. But I think that what we&#x27;ve just talked about is very useful and can be readily done. When you start setting up courses to teach graduate students to teach, I&#x27;m less certain of that. In the first place, you&#x27;ve got to decide who&#x27;s going to do that. You&#x27;ve got to find the faculty people who are genuinely interested, and frequently the wrong ones are interested. P.D.: This is true. It just seems to me that once you give somebody a Ph.D. you are certifying that they are competent to teach courses in their field. But what you are really certifying is that they have mastered the material; they have some knowledge. Sitterson: They have some knowledge, that&#x27;s correct . P.D.: But you&#x27;re really not saying anything about their capabilities as teachers. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s correct, you&#x27;re not. And some are not interested as we know. I have had the good luck to be judged a good teacher, by the way. And at different stages I have been identified as one of these. And at all levels, at undergraduate and graduate. At one period, back in the late 1950s, I was judged by the graduate students as the most provocative graduate faculty member in the history department. They didn&#x27;t say I was the best; I was provocative though. P.D.: That&#x27;s good, though! At least it&#x27;s my opinion that that&#x27;s one of the functions of a good teacher, is to be provocative; to stimulate you to think, to question. Sitterson: And, back in the early 1950s, when they did an appraisal of undergraduate teaching, I was listed among the top 10. Some graduate student did a survey and wrote the article. Then, of course, I received the award for undergraduate teaching. So, on that score, I feel gratified. P.D.: But you don&#x27;t think there are techniques that you could pass on to graduate students. To say, you know, this works, this is good, take this approach. Sitterson: Well, a girl came in my office yesterday. I didn&#x27;t remember her at first, she&#x27;s at Boston        University        now.                                        She&#x27;s a graduate student there. And she told me about what she&#x27;d been doing there. She was in the last undergraduate course I taught, which was 1981. She had taken a business degree, although she&#x27;d taken a course with me and she was telling me why she left business. She  went  to  work  for  a  bank  and  it  didn&#x27;t  give  her satisfaction, so she decided she would start teaching in Sunday school, doing this as a voluntary thing. And she found that that did give her satisfaction. So she was now taking a graduate degree in education at Boston University. And she said, &quot;You know, I learned so much in your class--not just about the information--but I learned so much about teaching.&quot; And I don&#x27;t know what she learned about teahcing. She just learned maybe certain ways in which I had accomplished things. Everyone has his or her own methods and techniques and so on. And she said, &quot;I just find that my whole approach to teaching is influenced by having had your course.&quot; P.D.: So basically it would be, as you suggested, going to the classes and watching the professors lecture. Sitterson: I think you learn more that way than trying to structure a course in teaching. I took a few education courses, because I taught in a boys preparatory school for a year. But I never really learned much in these, to tell you the honest truth, that I could not have learned better some other way. That doesn&#x27;t mean that some other people may not.  But I just didn&#x27;t. P.D. : So you continued to teach that one course even while you were Chancellor. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right. I gave up the economic field entirely. Various other people took it up. E. P. Douglass took it for a while; Cathey took it for a while. P.D.:  Who were these people you mentioned? 5 Sitterson: C. 0. Cathey took the pre-Civil War one, and E. P. Douglass took the post-Civil War one. I gave them up about 20 years ago. More than 20 years ago; 30 years ago. P.D.: And when you retired from being Chancellor, you came back to teaching? Sitterson:  Came back to teaching, that&#x27;s right. P.D.:  Let&#x27;s see, from 1972-1981. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right. I had 9 years of full-time teaching after my administration years. A lot of people say, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re the only person I&#x27;ve ever known who&#x27;s given up a prestigious position and so on. Why did you do that?&quot; Well, at the time that I announced my resignation, that occasioned all kinds of questions, interviews and so on. And, of course, basically (I said at the time) the reason I&#x27;m doing this is because, the thing I most like to do is to teach. That&#x27;s not to say that I haven&#x27;t enjoyed being Dean and being Chancellor. I enjoyed those. They were dimensions of my life that I wouldn&#x27;t give up for anything! But, I was getting to a point in my life--I was then 61 years old. And I was in a very pressure packed setting. Terrific pressure. And I was finding it increasingly difficult to keep on with the teaching. My energy levels were declining; you just don&#x27;t go at the same pace forever. And I felt also, that I had neglected my family to a certain degree, some of my children. Maybe that had some adverse impact on some of them. One of my children got caught up in the drug culture of the 1960s although fortunately he survived and is having a successful professional career. And in a sense, I wondered whether or not I was being fair to everybody with whom I was concerned. And I knew I couldn&#x27;t keep teaching and keep doing the Chancellorship, spend time with and care for my family, and also keep my health. Something had to give. And I decided administration was the thing I should leave. You know, when you make big decisions like that, when you look back you can always find some basis on which to second guess yourself. But I haven&#x27;t done that. I think that that decision was a good one and it worked out fine. The years I came back were extraordinarily interesting ones for me. I think I had more perspective in everything I was doing. And I think I made the contributions that I could make; I don&#x27;t think that there was a lot more that I could have done. I think I sucessfully guided the University through an extraordinarily difficult period. And it wasn&#x27;t easy to do. I don&#x27;t mean by that that I did the right thing all the time; that wasn&#x27;t possible. It&#x27;s not even possible with a good bit of hind sight. But I do think that one goal I had, that is, that the Univers i ty--when all this was over--should be a University in which all elements of the University respected one another,  were tolerant of one  another,  and  were  seriously  engaged  in  their responsibilities.  That&#x27;s what I wanted to have happen. I thought about this. What is it I hope to achieve when all this is over? Because I knew that the Vietnam generation would be over sometime. I didn&#x27;t know when, but I knew it would end someday! P.D.: It&#x27;s still here! [Laughter] Well, you probably had the most difficult time in which to be Chancellor that we&#x27;ve had in the entire history of the Univers ity. Sitterson: Well, it was also important during this period of time that their--- not be a break between the University and the public. And I spent a lot of time travelling and talking to alumni and to public officials and things of that sort, in order for them to be constantly aware of and seeing how the University was doing it&#x27;s business. P.D.: There&#x27;s one thing that has struck me, coming from Maine. I find many similarities between North Carolina and Maine, economically and the general attitude of people to life. But it strikes me that North Carolinians must place a greater value on higher education than Mainers do. Because with what appears to me to be a similar social and economic background with Mainland North Carolina on various national scales of per capita income and money spent on public education coming out very similar, North Carolina has a much, much better University system than Maine. Infinitely better than Maine&#x27;s. You had to work to maintain, I would think, during this period, the public support. Sitterson: That&#x27;s right. It was important that the public not become disenchanted. P.D.: Do you think that North Carolinians generally do see the value in higher education? Sitterson: Yes, oh yes, I do. And I think the University at Chapel Hill has had a lot to do with that. It has sent so many people into the public service. Tremendously important. P.D.: That, I think, wraps up most of what I would like to talk with you about. Sitterson: If you think of other things, Pamela, that you think it would be profitable for us to explore, I&#x27;d be glad to do that. I&#x27;ve talked so much to different students who have been working on the food worker&#x27;s strike, or working on the speaker&#x27;s ban, or working on various other things, I&#x27;m not so sure that I could add anything to what I&#x27;ve said that&#x27;s probably on file down there.

<dcterms:abstract>This is the second part of an extensive two-part interview with Viola Turner, former treasurer of North Carolina Mutual in Durham and first woman to serve on its executive board. Turner continues her vividly detailed discussion of early twentieth-century race relations from the first interview, beginning with several anecdotes about her experiences with racial discrimination while traveling by train in both the North and the South. She describes an itinerant musician she encountered in a Jim Crow train car while en route to Memphis, an experience she uses as a segue for discussing the Mississippi Blues as an especially unique form of regional African American popular culture. Although Turner argues that Mississippi Blues was not pervasive in Durham (where she had settled in 1924), she explains that it did have a thriving African American culture. After describing elaborate social gatherings for dancing and music within the African American community (particularly for the black middle class), Turner describes how community leaders worked to bring in prominent African American performers. According to Turner, the intricate social network of African Americans in Durham was integral in supporting African American professionals who traveled through the South. Turner also devotes considerable attention to describing the role of African American community leaders, including Dr. James E. Shepherd of North Carolina Central University and C. C. Spaulding of North Carolina Mutual. As an employee of North Carolina Mutual, Turner had a unique relationship with Spaulding. She describes him as a paternal figure (she and other employees called him &quot;Poppa&quot;) and offers numerous anecdotes about how he looked out for his employees. She recounts, for instance, how Spaulding ensured that his employees had the opportunity to vote by personally accompanying them through the registration process. Turner provides insight into the inner operations of North Carolina Mutual as a landmark African American business in Durham, and stresses its central role within the community. In addition, she discusses her perception of nascent civil rights efforts, such as the formation of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs; the effort of the NAACP on behalf of Thomas Hocutt to integrate the law school of the University of North Carolina; and lingering racial tensions in Durham. Finally, Turner offers commentary on gender dynamics, sharing her thoughts on instances of sex discrimination at North Carolina Mutual, expectations of single women workers within the community, and relationships: she describes her two short-term marriages in the 1920s, and concludes the interview with a lengthy discussion of her third husband and his support of her work and in the home.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Interview C-0016. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007): Electronic Edition.  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  VIOLA TURNER: [begins mid-sentence] . . .because they could treat me and I&#x27;m sure of that. For instance, I remember one occasion, I went home. I don&#x27;t know if everybody had to do that or whether that was the way things were done then. Usually, if you had a round-trip ticket in first class, you got off and, like your flight tickets now, you verified it to see what time you&#x27;re supposed to get where, and what. And, because I always had to change in Atlanta. I didn&#x27;t always go home by train or first class. It all depended on the trip. Well, this time I had first class accommodations going down and I stopped at the ticket office to verify my return. So the man was very courteous, very polite, nice as he could be and he said to me, &quot;Oh yes, this is O.K. but you&#x27;ll have to go to the ticket office in Atlanta to get your reservation for your Pullman into Durham.&quot; That sounded logical. I knew I made the change in Atlanta. I always made it coming down. I didn&#x27;t think anything about it. Maybe he was correct. I don&#x27;t know this. But any rate, I went on out to the house. Of course they very soon got it straight out there that I only just popped in; I wasn&#x27;t going to be there just a little while. Then I got ready to go home. I go down and I get the train in Macon. I get to Atlanta. And when I get to Atlanta, I got off the train here. And if you&#x27;ve ever been in the train station in Atlanta you know it&#x27;s quite a long distance to get up to the landing, the level, then get to the ticket office. When I get down here, the train I&#x27;m coming to Durham on is over here, about to pull out. I ask the porter where my train is and he tells me that. And I say I&#x27;ve got to go up to the ticket office to get my ticket straightened out, or whatever it is. Anyway, to get my receipt for my accommodation on the train. He says, &quot;Lady, unless you want to catch another train, you&#x27;ll never make it. That train&#x27;s just going to pull out. I can get your bags over there, but you can&#x27;t get up there and get back to save your life.&quot; So now, I have a choice. I either could take my chances and get on that train, or I could take my chances on going up there and trying to get my accommodations. So I took the chance of getting some kind of accommodations after I got on the train. So I got on the train and went right straight to the regular passenger coach. Because I didn&#x27;t have any accommodations. But luckily for me—and that happened so often on traveling. We did have that sort of break when I got on the train. After the ticket man came by and I made some comment to the fact that I could not get up there; I was supposed to have accommodations on the train. He didn&#x27;t turn me much of an answer, but we&#x27;d been riding maybe about thirty minutes or forty-five minutes, something like that, and the porter comes through, and he says, &quot;Captain says. . .&quot; and he goes like this. So I very shortly afterwards follow him and walked on back. And when I got back a little further, he says, &quot;Have a seat over here.&quot; So I rode in, what you would call the compartment, all the way into Durham. Rather than just having a is what I would&#x27;ve had. And that happened to you very often. The porter would look out for you. And I imagine he had some sort of agreement with the conductor so that you didn&#x27;t have any problem with it. But I have had some nice accommodations that I didn&#x27;t pay for because somebody mistreated me somewhere else. You ran into all sorts of things. I&#x27;ve had a few unpleasant experiences, too.  WALTER WEARE: In connection with traveling?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. Well, two that stand out in my mind at this moment. The first time I went to Chicago, I had gotten accommodations from here with no real problem. By this time, it wasn&#x27;t any great problem to get accommodations. I don&#x27;t think you could always walk right up to the ticket window and get them, depending on who&#x27;s waiting on you and that sort of thing. But if you called, and you knew somebody back there, as I did now: I knew Mr. Bobbitt real well, from Mr. Merritt&#x27;s knowing him. And sometimes I&#x27;d call. Well, at any rate, I had accommodations. I had no problem there. But when I got to Cincinnati? I don&#x27;t remember, but overnight. The next morning, I got ready to go to breakfast and I get up and I get washed up and I go on back to the dining car. And this is the only time this ever happened to me and I don&#x27;t think I ever felt anything any more keener than I did this. When I got to the door of the dining room, the first person who saw me—I don&#x27;t know if he was the white man who was in charge of the whole dining car; I don&#x27;t know what his position was—he looked, and he saw me standing there, and he just on away, like he didn&#x27;t see me. I really didn&#x27;t think too much about that. I didn&#x27;t recall having seen a white person in that particular, what looked as if he may have been sort of , or something like that. So I didn&#x27;t think much of that. So I stood. About this time the dining car porter passes the white man going back, when he goes this way. And when he looked up and saw me, the expression on his face was something that I will never forget. [laughter]  He looked at me as if  he were saying, &quot;What on earth are you doing here?&quot; It was one of those sort of [expression], and then followed quickly with, &quot;What on earth will I be able to do with you?&quot; Well, I am floored. Because I have travelled enough now, that I have never run into that sort of . . .and never with a Negro porter. Usually when you run into one of them, they always look as though they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Thank God, at last you&#x27;ve been able to get decent accommodations.&quot; And you&#x27;d have the hardest time trying to even give them a tip. Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, on that same trip, the man who was the porter on the train, if he dusted me once, he dusted me up and down, all over. Just little things, like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m so glad to see you. Are you having a nice trip?&quot; Just little, you know. I got off and he had been so nice to me, I decide I&#x27;m going to be r-e-a-l sporty, you know. Never did know exactly how I was supposed to tip, you know. But I&#x27;m going to give him a nice tip. So I folded up a paper dollar—that was some money for me. That was the World Fair time, Chicago World Fair.  WALTER WEARE: 1936?  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s a long time ago. Usually what a dollar was with me, a quarter was my speed. But for this man, I folded this up, so it wouldn&#x27;t show so much; I&#x27;m just going to slip it to him. With the last brush-down, my little suit he brushed down. &quot;Oh no, dear. Oh, no, no, no. It&#x27;s been a pleasure having you on here. No.&quot; I said, &quot;But you&#x27;ve been so. . .&quot; &quot;Oh, no, no, no.&quot; He just folded my little money back. &quot;No, dear. It&#x27;s been a pleasure having you on here. It makes me very happy to see you here. And I hope you enjoy your trip all the way.&quot; He did more for me than that, later, however, but I had no idea. Now, going back to this waiter, who looked like he wished there were same way he could have just waved me completely into oblivion, or somewhere. So I just stood. Of course by this time, I have fought discrimination so many times and so many ways, that I could&#x27;ve just froze and stay and look at anything and anybody, you know, just look. So I&#x27;m just standing, looking at him. So he stood there, and then finally he gave me a sign, and he led me over to a table where, with all due respects to the lady—and I apologize a thousand times for this, anytime I think of it, because I could be so wrong—but she looked like the most hardened prostitute. You know that vision you can get about a hardened woman who has had all the hard knocks? Well, that&#x27;s what she looked like. Painted to the gills. Hard lines under here. Dyed hair. He set me there. The only thing I can think of that he figured: he looked at her and said, &quot;Well, you should be willing to accept anything from anybody&quot;, and he set me down. So that&#x27;s the way I set down at a table.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Was she a white woman?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, she was white. But she looked like life had dealt her every raw deal in the world, and she was fighting it to death. Painted and dyed, and everything. But, you know, that&#x27;s why I say everytime I think of her, or think of that experience, in the back of my mind, I&#x27;m offering apologies. Because she was the nicest thing that ever happened to me in an unpleasant situation. She didn&#x27;t look shocked. She didn&#x27;t look like anything had happened. She just looked up from what she was having and said, &quot;Good morning. I hope you&#x27;re having a pleasant trip.&quot; And I said, &quot;Thank you&quot;, and sat down. I ordered toast, orange juice, coffee. I couldn&#x27;t eat the toast. I sipped about one sip of the orange juice and about half of the cup of coffee. I was filled right up to here. I don&#x27;t know how that man destroyed me, but he destroyed me! I guess the first thing: I didn&#x27;t expect it from one of my own. And then the expression on his face: &quot;What in the world are you doing here? How dare you come here on my car!&quot; But she was just as pleasant as she could be, and she tried her best to make me feel comfortable, evidently. Because, you know, she was just as pleasant, but normally; she didn&#x27;t seem to be acting unnatural. But just a nice person. And I tried my best to respond. But all the time, within me, I&#x27;m apologizing to her: oh, I am so sorry to have judged you to be what you look like you are. But I always believed that that&#x27;s what he read there, when he put me with this woman. But she really saved my day for me. I would have loved to have helped her look a little different [laughter]  if I could have, as I  thought about her. So, that was, I guess, really the worst experience I ever had. But the nearest to that was coming down from New York. I had gone over to see relatives in Plainfield. And instead of taking my train out of New York, I picked it up in Newark, which is just about ten minutes out of New York. And in that short time, some smart aleck conductor or the porter had put a white man in my reserved seat. See, I wasn&#x27;t pulling out of New York, and they had put him there. Probably came in with no extra space, or something, I don&#x27;t know, but he was in my seat. I didn&#x27;t recognize it for that. Didn&#x27;t think about it. Because, what was happening: if you&#x27;re riding backwards, you&#x27;re in the upper, I think that&#x27;s the way it was. And if you&#x27;re riding forward, you&#x27;re in the lower. Well, at any rate, we were sitting opposite each other. So one of us was in the upper and the other was in the lower. But the lower was my reservation, and however we were seated, he was seated in mine. I don&#x27;t know whether I was seated in his, or seated in somebody else&#x27;s. But I was aware of the fact that I was not in the right seat. But I didn&#x27;t say anything. Then, after some little time, I made some comment, probably to the ticket agent when he came in, or something. But whatever was said at the time, I didn&#x27;t get any satisfaction. But I didn&#x27;t get enough of an objection to think that I had any problem. So I went along with it while thinking I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all. After all, there was nothing so serious about this. It was pretty early in the afternoon. So, I don&#x27;t know what happened that did give me some apprehension, but there was something wrong. And it was something that was not about to get corrected. And it may have been the attitude of the passenger, I don&#x27;t remember that part now. But what I do remember is my solution to the problem. So I waited. It seems to me we had gotten into Delaware, but we hadn&#x27;t been riding too long. Maybe an hour. So I called the porter. I said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to lie down, so please make down my bed right away.&quot; [laughter] And that&#x27;s when the  commotion started. They started making explanations to me, you know, about the time they made them down, when you got further into Delaware, when you did this and when you did that. And I just kept being adamant, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel too well; I want to lie down; and I&#x27;d like to get it done right away.&quot; And I didn&#x27;t ever give an inch. I just kept on. So finally they worked it out. I don&#x27;t know what the heck they did. There was a lot of, you know, coming back and forth, and couldn&#x27;t do it and couldn&#x27;t do it, and I kept holding my point. &quot;I&#x27;ll have to see someone, because I must lie down. And I insist on doing it right away. I hate to make a commotion about it, but I have my reservation, and you know I have a reservation. So what are you going to do about it?&quot; I just kept throwing the thing back in their laps. I wasn&#x27;t as brave as I was acting. I was scared to death [laughter] .  They were bigger than I was; I didn&#x27;t know what they would do. But finally they made down my bed and they made my friend, who evidently was planning to sit there and hold my seat; he wasn&#x27;t planning to move. They had to make some other arrangements.  WALTER WEARE: They moved him on out?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. They moved him somewhere. They made my bed and he wasn&#x27;t there.  WALTER WEARE: You had travelled, though, in the deep South, where there wasn&#x27;t railroad service, and you&#x27;d have to be overnight and look for accommodations. That&#x27;s a whole different world, isn&#x27;t it?  VIOLA TURNER: Well, I would guess so. But I didn&#x27;t ever have that experience, I don&#x27;t think. The longest trip I ever took in the South —I don&#x27;t know if I remember it, but I think I do—I was coming from Oklahoma City to Georgia, on the Rock Island. I remember getting to Memphis. It was just a matter that you rode all night. Porters would come through to see if anybody wanted a pillow. When I got to Memphis, I remember I had time there, because I was able to walk out a while. But I think you picked up your train—rather, I picked up mine—say, maybe, when you got in, it left in an hour, or two hours, or something. And then you rode all day. Well, by the time you rode all day there, you would be maybe in Atlanta. But I never had to leave the station to stay overnight or anything. That was about as rough a trip, though, as I ever took. Because, there you rode in the little day coach that would never be bigger—maybe from there to here, that far; and about half as wide—and people would travel with anything and everything.  WALTER WEARE: That was the Jim Crow car?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, definitely. That was Jim Crow all the way. And they would have anything and everything. Although, if you can keep a sense of humour, there&#x27;s always something funny. I remember on that train from Oklahoma—I believe that old man came all the way to Memphis. He was sitting on the far seat with a guitar. And he played the guitar and sang all along. Then he&#x27;d get rest and after a while, he&#x27;d sing again. And everytime the train would stop—and it may not have been local, but it stopped at many stations—and a person would get on, he would ask you where you were going. I remember when I got on, he said, after a while, &quot;Daughter, where you going?&quot; Well, I told him that I was going to Georgia. He said, Well, he didn&#x27;t know nobody over there in Georgia. And he just went back to singing. The next person he asked, I believe he was going to Texas. Either he was coming from Texas or he was going to Texas. And if he&#x27;s going to Texas, evidently he had to get to Memphis and then take off somewhere. But he must have been coming from, because it seems to me he should have been going the other way if he was going to Texas. But at any rate, Texas was the thing he said to the old man. The only man stopped and he said, &quot;Texas. Uh huh. Do you know Joe?&quot; The man said, &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Joe! You know, I never did know the rest of his name, but he&#x27;s from Texas. I just figured you might know Joe.&quot; The man said, &quot;No.&quot; He didn&#x27;t think he knew Joe. Well, I thought I would die. I sat back there and I thought that was the funniest question I had ever heard. Joe from Texas. And to the old man it never seemed funny. He just thought. &quot;Joe. I never did know Joe&#x27;s other name, but he&#x27;s from Texas.&quot;  WALTER WEARE: Was that a musician, you think?  VIOLA TURNER: No, no, he was just a. . .well, I say ‘no, no’ but that could be wrong. But one of these itinerant players. The only place I&#x27;d ever seen it was Mississippi. When I was in Clarksdale I was awakened one night with this music. I didn&#x27;t know what in the world it was. I jumped up and tried to find wherever it was coming from, and finally discovered that they were outside of my window—three men with their guitars or banjos or whatever—playing and singing. And the lady, where I was living, had gotten up, you know, and so, of course, I&#x27;m full of questions, what this is all about. And she said that they travel around like that and they stop and sing, and if you have anything to give them: money, or even sometimes food, you just pass it out to them. And they entertained you. But the interesting thing about that was, some of the music those people sang that night, I&#x27;ve heard on T.V. with the musicians of the day, making fortunes out of it, even to the words.  WALTER WEARE: Blues. Mississippi blues?  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s right. I don&#x27;t remember all of it, but a part of it went: &quot;standing on the railroad track, honey won&#x27;t you take me back?&quot; You know, and all the verses went on, but always there was this &quot;railroad track&quot;. And the same beat and the same sort of harmony, and you hear it right today. I say, yes, you&#x27;ve all been down there and picked it up.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember at the time how you felt about that music, having been trained in classical music, but having this temptation for ragtime?  VIOLA TURNER: I like it, I like it. Not only that, I&#x27;ll tell you another thing. I say to myself and I kid people when it comes up. I say, I know perfectly well that there&#x27;s definitely African blood. I&#x27;ve got African blood, there&#x27;s no question about that. Because drums set me going. I love them. I just love the sounds of drums. And when somebody really can do drums well, my foot&#x27;s just going, and going and going. I like the sound, I like the tempo. I like that kind of music.  WALTER WEARE: Did you ever feel kind of restrained then, from working at the Mutual, where things were kind of. . .well, let me ask it this way. Were these kind of street musicians—blues people, jazz groups in Durham—were there, do you recall?  VIOLA TURNER: Not that I knew anything about. The only place I ever saw or heard that kind of music, you know, just out played for the public, was in Mississippi. And that seems to have been the characteristic; they did it all around in that area. As a matter of fact, did I say Clarksdale? Because it was not Clarksdale, it was Meridian, Mississippi where I had that experience. But the lady where I was living said that that was customary. They expected, usual. They travelled all through the state in that area of the country and played that music, and you handed them out. But I never saw anybody do that here. I hear the music here. Anywhere where there are blacks, you&#x27;re going to hear somebody who plays that type of music, there&#x27;s no question. And good. They usually do a good job. I think it&#x27;s a natural thing.  WALTER WEARE: You mentioned Bess Whitted yesterday, and the piano and so forth. What kind of music was played at the forum at the Mutual?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, we played some of every type of music. Not the blues and that sort of thing, no. We had a glee club. We sang spirituals; we liked spirituals , but anthems. I was trying to think of one that was one of my favorites because of the young man who sang the solo part. &quot;Bells of Saint Mary&quot;, that was one of the things we sang a lot. There was this Italian street song. We had very good soloists and we did all of the &quot;zing, zing, zing&quot; sort of thing. So we did all types of music, but no blues, no jazz. No kind of the kind of music that we might go that evening to party, and there was somebody there who could plunk it all out on the piano and all of gather around and hear him sing every one of the verses, you know. And loved every minute of it. But the music she used was good music.  WALTER WEARE: But at private parties, though, there might be blues singing, or jazz?  VIOLA TURNER: There would be plenty of it played, and usually—he&#x27;s dead now, but he was one of the professors over here at North Carolina Central—Dr. Brown. Brown was a young fellow here, and he was teaching. I wish I could remember his first name. But any rate, I can&#x27;t right this minute. He taught. But he could play some of the bluest blues you have ever heard. And he had some of the bluest verses going with those blues. And he could play other music as well. But he really could play that sort of thing. And he&#x27;d sit down there, and he had all sorts of verses, probably some he made up, and plenty that he picked up, because they are here. A lot of people know many, many, many that have been handed down and handed down. This fellow that I said had such a beautiful voice, he used to sing a real—what was that thing? Really, it was a song that you didn&#x27;t even let the older generation hear you listen to him sing that one. I can&#x27;t remember the name of it now. Of course, in today&#x27;s time, it would be called mild. But for that time, we were really being wild when we set down and let John Allen play his number and say his verses. Because they were all inuendo or suggestive.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  VIOLA TURNER: But I used to go to some of the tournaments. And one of the best tennis players there at that time—I don&#x27;t know that I remember his name too well, either. But any rate, when the tennis was all done and we would gather around in the evenings, he could sit down and entertain you half the night with his brand of blues and his verses that went along with it. So, that has always been around, and most of us—particularly the older ones of us—recognize so many of the things that you hear today, and hear the modern musicians—I say modern-time musicians with their rock and their roll and with everything that they have—basically under there they have really stolen what has been going on for generations. Because, I told you once about the boy that used to come—or the man who used to come—and play my piano, my mama&#x27;s piano. And he was doing the same thing then. The same beat, the same heavy bass that went down here, and they&#x27;d go up in here and do all this sort of thing. But when you got through with it, it was the same rhythm.  WALTER WEARE: Could Bess Whitted play that way? Did you ever hear her?  VIOLA TURNER: No, Bess didn&#x27;t do much playing. But Bess knew music. Bess had gone to—I believe was probably an AMA school—that&#x27;s where she went to school. And I think you have to give the AMA folks a lot of credit. Most of us who went to those schools came out with a fairly decent background training.  WALTER WEARE: Would she have frowned on that music, though? Have you ever seen her at private parties where she would enjoy the blues?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh heck, yes. She probably could make up some of the verses, better than most of us. Because she could sit down and she loved jokes. And they could get kind of blue. And she&#x27;d still enjoy them. She would be sitting over there with the joke tellers when I would&#x27;ve moved off because they&#x27;d gotten a little too blue for me. Oh, yes. She loved all of that sort of thing.  WALTER WEARE: Was there anybody at the Mutual who would stand back? Would C.C. Spaulding?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, he didn&#x27;t approve of any of the things we did. He didn&#x27;t approve of your dancing. If he had known anybody had even had a cigaret or a little wine—I didn&#x27;t say whiskey, just a little wine—he wouldn&#x27;t have approved of it. Way in late, late, late years, I went on a trip to California. We were going out there for insurance convention, but they made up a train in Chicago, and we travelled across country, the southern route, and came back the northern route. It was marvelous. It took us better than thirty days. But Poppa was on the train with us. One of the girls with us—Eula and I were going together and we had another young girl with us, a friend of ours. And the reason she was going, she had lost her husband, very sudden death. And he was a very young doctor, a young man. And we thought maybe this would be a nice trip for her. She had relatives in California, so we said come on and go with us. Then, if you want to stay with them a while, you come back whenever you get ready. So she did. So one evening, she&#x27;s not feeling so well, and Mr. Spaulding, of course, considered everybody on the train were his children. So, he stopped by our compartment. &quot;How is Louise?&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, she doesn&#x27;t feel so good.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;I&#x27;m going down this way, but when I come back, you all bring her up there to my apartment. I&#x27;ve got something that maybe will make her feel a little better.&quot; So we said, yes, sir, and brought her down after a while; Louise and Eula and I go up there. When we get there we say, &quot;Mr. Spaulding, we&#x27;ve brought Louise up here.&quot; He says, &quot;Come on in, come on in and set down.&quot; Then he says, &quot;I&#x27;m going to give you a little something that my doctor gave me, and he says that it&#x27;s good for you, and under the circumstances I think that this will be good for you.&quot; He reached around and he came out with a little flask, about like that. You could have slipped it in your pocket. I would guess that it could probably hold a half-pint. And then he went over and he got a tablespoon [laughter] ,  and he poured it out from the flask and he gave it Louise and told her,&quot;Now, go get in the bed and you&#x27;ll sleep well. My doctor told me,‘take one of these every night’ before I go to bed.&quot; One tablespoon of brandy! So, we then knew that Poppa was really concerned about Louise, because we had never heard him give anybody permission to even have a drink of wine. And he&#x27;d given her a tablespoon full of brandy. No. He was strictly the churchman in that time that you weren&#x27;t supposed to dance, you weren&#x27;t supposed to play cards, you weren&#x27;t supposed to smoke. I don&#x27;t guess he even had smoking in it because in the earlier days, nobody was even thinking about smoking. That came a little bit later. I&#x27;m sure he would not have approved of it, and didn&#x27;t, as time went on. But honestly, we laugh now when we think about that we do have dancing in the Mutual building. I say Poppa&#x27;s flip-flopping wherever he is right now, because he wouldn&#x27;t let us have no kind of party where dancing was involved in the Mutual building on Paris Street. No. And yet. . .is that off?  WALTER WEARE: Uh uh.  VIOLA TURNER: I&#x27;m not going to tell you this one then. On Poppa. [chuckling]  WALTER WEARE: Well, Poppa&#x27;s gone. [chuckling, too]  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m not going to tell this on Poppa. I&#x27;ll go to something else.  WALTER WEARE: I&#x27;m going to call Esa and tell him that I&#x27;m going to be there directly. While I&#x27;m doing that, why don&#x27;t you talk to Juanita about the entertainment. One of the things people are interested in is this fabled black middle class. If you didn&#x27;t have all these institutions, opera house, ballets, and so forth, and yet there was the education and the finances, what did people do? What kind of parties and so forth?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. I&#x27;ll tell you. [business getting to the phone]. Primarily it was just parties in the home, and we had some people who were really party-givers. For instance, Mrs. Darnell, whom we all called Patty, Patty Darnell. She was John Merrit&#x27;s daughter. They had a very lovely, great big home, right up there beyond the site of the old White Rock Baptist Church. I think that address was 506, a five-hundred block on Fayetteville Street. A great big, tall, turretted house. And Patty used to give always a New Year&#x27;s party. And it was New Year&#x27;s evening, and it went on into the night and, you know, to welcome in the new year. Everybody, for years, looked forward to that party. Bess was a great party-giver, Bess Whitted. And Bess usually had the Christmas party. And her parties started in the evening—oh, ten or eleven o&#x27;clock—and you stayed all night and ended up with breakfast, at her party. Yes, always breakfast. That, again, was one of the events that you looked forward to.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: These aren&#x27;t dinner parties?  VIOLA TURNER: No. They&#x27;re big dancing parties.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: With live music?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, with live music. Usually a piano player. Sometimes they&#x27;d have a piano player and maybe one or two people with instruments. But always there was some good piano player. Then you danced, in the home, and you were served, you know. Not heavy services, not that kind. Now, those were the parties that you knew were coming up. Everybody expected them, and if they hadn&#x27;t come up, I think everybody would have been very unhappy.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: These were formal parties where you got all dressed up?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. Evening gowns, oh, you dressed to go to those special parties, the Christmas and the New Year&#x27;s parties. In between it was nothing at all for Patty or Miss Bessie to have little parties, maybe with, say, three or four tables of bridge, that many people. And they might have a dinner party, or they may have just a get-together. And, if somebody came to town, and you call around and say, be sure to come up to my house or to your house, we have a guest in town. Then that would start it. They&#x27;d get to town and there&#x27;d be a siege of parties, one right after the other. Someone in every home here would give a party and invite everybody, and then on down. That sort of thing still happens here a good deal. Really, if Martha was having—that&#x27;s Patty again, Patty Darnell—if she was having guests in, she might have a series of parties, smaller ones. But the two that I mentioned, the Christmas party and the New Year&#x27;s party, that included all of your friends, almost. You&#x27;d have a large party. And their houses were large enough to hold them. Some would be over in one end of the house and around, just telling jokes and drinking. If you were at Dr. Darnell&#x27;s you were drinking, and if you weren&#x27;t drinking it was just that you didn&#x27;t want to. He always had drinks and he loved to get behind his little bar and mix them you know, for everybody. And there were a couple of rooms where people would be just sitting and running their mouths. There&#x27;d be another one where there were the story-tellers. There were always a couple of folks who were the story-tellers, telling jokes. And there&#x27;d be a half-dozen people sitting around them. Then over here, somebody&#x27;s playing the piano, and the folks are dancing. That sort of thing.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Were they mostly Mutual people.  VIOLA TURNER: No. Just Durham people. There&#x27;d be some Mutual people, and also other Durham people. Well, people from the College, professional people, doctors and their wives, dentists and their wives, lawyers and their wives, school teachers and their husbands or wives. Just a general group. Many of the groups have formed: you&#x27;re all members of the same church; you&#x27;re members of the same club. There have always been two or three bridge clubs in town and they meet regularly. And they have a party during some season. Or, maybe somebody that you had invited. For instance, I belong to a small bridge club. We started off at one time and we had about thirteen, now we&#x27;re down to seven—from death, or moving somewhere else. But we invite two or three people always to our bridge club. Same thing&#x27;s true with other people. Now, after a while, maybe somebody that you&#x27;ve invited several times, or your club has invited them several times, they decide they&#x27;re going to entertain the entire club, so they entertain all of us there. So, we did a lot of entertaining in the home, all around. Now, years ago, when we were young, Eula, myself, and that group, Betty Goodlow and all of those. There were two buildings up here: the Masonic building and the Royal Knights of King David building. And the top floors were dance halls. Then you would have a band. You&#x27;d get various ones, sometimes very good ones, sometimes local. Sometimes if not exactly local, maybe Greensboro, or Raleigh or someplace, where a little group had gotten together and were pretty good. And then you&#x27;d have a big dance. We used to do a lot of that. That is not done anymore because they don&#x27;t have those buildings anymore. That may be one of the reasons, I don&#x27;t know. `Course all of us finally got sick of it; we were too old for that. But that was one of our forms of entertainment, maybe two or three dances a year. And sometimes they were very pretty, and very unique dances. And then we used to do another thing that nobody seems to do anymore. Maybe they don&#x27;t have the nerve to do it, or the guts, or maybe you wouldn&#x27;t do it in this day, I don&#x27;t know. But Bess Whitted was a very dynamic person and had lots of drive and plenty of nerve. All she needed was a few people to follow her and work with her. And we have brought some quite unusual entertainment to Durham over a period of years. Among them, for instance—maybe now it&#x27;s so they&#x27;re all faded away so you wouldn&#x27;t know them—but we brought Mobile Sisal&#x27;s Band here on one occasion, which was quite an outstanding band. He was quite a musician and had quite an excellent band. Over many, many years, it had played out of Cincinnati, I believe it was, for years on radio at one of the clubs there. Well, we brought them here one year.  WALTER WEARE: Would that band play at the Royal Knights of King David?  VIOLA TURNER: No. Let&#x27;s see, where did Mobile Sisal play? I believe that was at the—what did I tell you we have downtown now?  WALTER WEARE: The Masonic Lodge?  VIOLA TURNER: No, no, no. That was right here in . They were both up here on Fayetteville Street. Downtown now. What was the thing called? It isn&#x27;t an auditorium, but down on Foster Street. Between Morgan and Foster Street. It&#x27;s the Durham Civic Center. That&#x27;s where we brought them. I couldn&#x27;t think of the name of the thing; but that&#x27;s called the Civic Center. It&#x27;s a great big building. And you could bring a big band there. We brought Mobile Sisal here. I&#x27;m trying to think what other band. When I say ‘we’, I don&#x27;t mean me personally, although I worked with Bess on the Mobile Sisal. In fact our whole group worked with her to bring them here. We have brought other artists here on many occasions. I&#x27;m trying to think, now, who brought Lionel Hampton here. He&#x27;s been brought here.  WALTER WEARE: What about Duke Ellington or Count Basie?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes  WALTER WEARE: All of those?  VIOLA TURNER: They have all been here. But many of them were brought here at times when we had a young man—I suppose he had to make money out of it some way or other. But he would bring the big bands in here and they would either be at that Civic Center or at one of these warehouses. That was back at the time when I was talking about Miller and Lyle were here. But Duke Ellington, Count Basie, another man who came along right about at the same time .  WALTER WEARE: Louis Armstrong, was he here?  VIOLA TURNER: No, I don&#x27;t ever recall Louis being here. Unless he was brought here when a couple of things have come here to the Center Theatre. But I don&#x27;t remember Louis Armstrong ever being here. And I&#x27;ve known about him for nearly all of his existence. But I don&#x27;t think he was ever here. But there was another band man who came along about the same time as Count Basie. I can see the man, you know, picture him, but I can&#x27;t think of his name, now. But any rate, virtually all of the big bands have been here one time or other.  WALTER WEARE: Now, at this Civic Center, would that be whites and blacks?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. It&#x27;s used by both whites and blacks. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever known of any time when they did anything together. And yet, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a time when blacks couldn&#x27;t observe from the balcony or whites couldn&#x27;t observe from the balcony. For instance, you&#x27;re having something downstairs and I don&#x27;t think there was ever any prohibition that you could not let people go upstairs and watch. But that&#x27;s just in my mind. I don&#x27;t recall.  WALTER WEARE: When Mobile Sisal was here, you&#x27;re suggesting that maybe whites sat upstairs and blacks downstairs?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, no, no. Let me see if I can figure about that. I&#x27;m not suggesting that, but I am saying this: very likely that happened and there would have been no objection to it happening. But I don&#x27;t know that it did happen in that specific case. Because that was a situation that was handled so closely by a group that we had all of the tickets. You see, it was something we had gone on the line to furnish the pay. And it was our individual effort—like a club. So, unless we sold you a ticket, there would not have been any way for you to be there. I can&#x27;t tell you that we didn&#x27;t sell some white tickets; we probably did. I don&#x27;t know whether we did or not, but we probably did, and if we did, those people could come and would have no problem coming. I don&#x27;t remember the whole thing enough to say that is what happened in that instance. But I do know this, that many of the efforts that were efforts initiated by Bess or some of our club groups—and always Bess was in that sort of thing, because she had more of this spirit of adventure to venture out and pay. And we agreed to pay somebody two thousand dollars to come here, without a dime. Because we believed we could do it, you know. She was the kind of person who could say—I don&#x27;t know if you ever heard of Philippa Skylar?  WALTER WEARE: Oh, yes.  VIOLA TURNER: VIOLA A child prodigy. Well, we brought her here. And she and her mother stayed at Bess&#x27;s house. As you know, Mrs. Skylar was white.  WALTER WEARE: This is the wife of George Skylar? Editor of the Pittsburgh Courier?  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s the man, and the woman. Well, you know, she was a Texas woman. Well, she stayed right at Bess&#x27;s house. Well, I feel very sure that we sold tickets to both white and black for that. And I think—my problem is remembering where these various things were; we did so many of those sort of things back then at certain times. I don&#x27;t recall now whether that was at the Ben Duke Auditorium, or it could&#x27;ve been at the Center Theatre.  WALTER WEARE: What intrigues me is that whites and blacks were attending the same event.  VIOLA TURNER: There was no separation.  WALTER WEARE: They would not segregate the whites?  VIOLA TURNER: No. If we had something, which we had many of, and we sold tickets. If we had it, we had to sell tickets, because that&#x27;s the way we&#x27;d raise the money. Ours was usually for scholarships or one of these sort of things. And if we had white friends, ‘would you like to buy tickets to this; we&#x27;re going to bring so-and-so’. If they were sold tickets, they came to the audience just like anybody else, and sat anywhere. If they came down here, they always did that at Ben Duke Auditorium. Anything we ever gave at the Center Theatre: the same thing was true. The reason the question is coming into your mind: if things came to these warehouses, and the things that went to the Civic Center, that were not sponsored by a club or some group, was sponsored by an individual. And, no doubt, the individual made money out of it. I never knew how those things ran. I knew the man who brought a lot of the things there, named Leif Austin. But I&#x27;m quite sure that there had to be some way he was making money out of doing it, if it was a success. Well, now, what happened there: he advertised that so-and-so will be here on such-and-such a time; tickets will be available at the door, at the drugstore, at this place or that place. Now, you went there and you bought your ticket. If you were white and you wanted to go to a black thing, you went there and bought your ticket. If you were black and you wanted to go to a white thing, you went and bought tickets. But at that time, I feel very sure, that if you were black and you wanted to buy something to see a white one, you bought a ticket that sat you in the gallery. You didn&#x27;t get a ticket that put you down on the dance floor. I feel very sure that&#x27;s true. I never did it. I&#x27;m just telling you that&#x27;s what the time had demanded. I don&#x27;t think any blacks would&#x27;ve bought tickets and gone down there to dance on the dance floor without anticipating some problem. On the other hand, very likely—no I can&#x27;t say that. If whites had tried to do it at a black affair, they would have had just as much trouble, if they had tried to walk down there and dance. Because there would have been some of us that would say, ‘What are you doing down here?’ And that would have been it. But I don&#x27;t think either would have had any trouble going up and sitting in the balcony to look at what&#x27;s going on. And I did go on the balcony on two occasions that I know of. However, I think they were black performers that I went, in both cases. But I do know this: people did go to the balcony. But they were public affairs. Our affairs, like I said, that we brought, like Philippa Skylar—we brought Roland Hayes here years ago; we brought Mobile Sisal&#x27;s band and many things I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m forgetting. Because we had a project nearly every year, of that sort of thing. But when they brought here, the tickets were in our hands; we put the tickets out. We did not discriminate against them, but we wanted the right kind of audience always. [break]   WALTER WEARE: Something I&#x27;d like you to expand on a bit is this difficulty of travel for black professionals in this period, given the lack of accommodations, and the great number of people coming to visit Durham—either on business, or to see the Mutual, or whatever—and where they would stay. Was there a hotel for a time?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. For a time, Dr. Darnell, who was the medical director for North Carolina Mutual, built a hotel down on Pettigrew Street, where the drugstore and all of those things were. Very lovely place; it was true for several years, as long as he held it in charge and was responsible for how it was managed and run. It was very lovely. Anybody would have been quite comfortable and would not have objected to going there. And many people did come during that period.  WALTER WEARE: What was the name of it?  VIOLA TURNER: Biltmore. Biltmore Hotel. And the theatre was in there, that we were talking about. And at first, downstrairs, was a very nice eating place. The eating place did not last too long, and the idea of eating was abandoned. Then finally Dr. Darnell started letting other people run the hotel, and so it began, in time, to go down to the place where few people that would have come to visit me, that I would have recommended to go there to stay.  WALTER WEARE: For the most part would people stay in people&#x27;s homes when they came here?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, for the most part.  WALTER WEARE: Were there one or two homes that were kind of singled out that would kind of serve as hotels for these dignitaries?  VIOLA TURNER: You know, I tried to think of that briefly, when we were talking yesterday, because that&#x27;s what happened in my home in Macon. At my mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s home, every person who came from North Carolina Mutual was directed to see Mrs. Mitchell, or Mr. Mitchell, that they very likely would have a room that they could put you up, and maybe feed them. On occasion she would, but she didn&#x27;t always do that. Especially if they were going to stay any length of time. But Mr. Wheeler&#x27;s father, Mr. Merritt, and one of the Spaulding brothers who eventually was working in Georgia—all stayed in our house when I was a kid.  WALTER WEARE: They just knew about your house?  VIOLA TURNER: Word of mouth, you know. I don&#x27;t know how Mr. Merritt got there the first time, but very likely somebody said to him, `what you do is this.&quot; Even a person who didn&#x27;t ordinarily do it—because my mother didn&#x27;t make a habit of it; we didn&#x27;t have somebody in the house all of the time. But maybe a friend of hers would say to her, ‘You know, Mr. so-and-so is coming here’, or, ‘Mrs. so-and-so is coming here, could you take care of them for about a day or so?’ Or a week, or something. Well, if she liked you well enough, she knew that it would be O.K. And if she had a spare room, she&#x27;d say, ‘Well, yes, o.k., I&#x27;ll take him.’ Two things: first thing, it was rendering a service. But also, she was making a little money because they were going to pay her a little something. And few people didn&#x27;t need a little extra money. Certainly my family. So, I&#x27;m sure then when Mr. Merritt comes back to Durham and they&#x27;re going to send Mr. Wheeler down there, because he&#x27;s going to open up Atlanta, and then come on in to Macon. ‘So, when you get to Macon, you be sure to get in touch with the Mitchells on such-and-such a street.’  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  VIOLA TURNER: [begins mid-sentence]—five rooms and the kitchen and another sleeping quarter, but only for the family use. The house was one of the old-fashioned houses where right here is the front door and the porch starts here and goes all the way around the house, you know. So, in the back, that same porch is latticed in and it&#x27;s large enough—even the hall that came down the center of these rooms would be so wide, you could set up a dining room table in the back hall. Oh, yes. Because many times, that&#x27;s where we ate, the back hall. And, if there&#x27;s nobody there but family, you could eat on the back porch that&#x27;s latticed in, in the summer. Then, over on this side—because my father was a handyman, doing all sorts of things— your porch starts here, then curves, and goes around here. Then when you got around here, this was my mother and father&#x27;s bedroom. And there were windows here. All Southern houses had a whole lot of windows. And usually were long windows, almost down. Well, now, my father came here to this end of the porch and had blinds. I&#x27;m sure he had gotten them from somewhere; I don&#x27;t know where. But almost all houses used to have long blinds. They call them blinds or shutters, you know. And he had gotten enough of them, that he had gone on the outside of that porch, and that whole section of that porch that was off of their bedroom, and had the blinds all the way around. So what he had was a little room out there, with the shutters. You could open them up so the air could blow in. And then they had a smaller bed out there, not a big bed, but a bed that was out there that looked like a couch in the day. But if the weather was real hot, they stepped right out of their bedroom here and would sleep out there on the porch with all the shutters open. So, when you talk about all the rooms that they made themselves, there&#x27;s a lot of them. But the house itself had two bedrooms on one side. And over on this side was the living room or the parlor, and then another bedroom under that window. Then there was a little room here. I don&#x27;t know what it had been originally, but it was my room now, and it was no bigger than that section right over there. Because there was nothing in there, but a little couch, cot-like, and, as I recall, a mirror on the wall. And then you could go from that little room where I slept on to this porch, where, if you wanted, you could eat out there, or you could sit out there. It was latticed in. And, all of the bathing, you know, was in tubs. You bathed on Saturday nights. Except that my mother had a very bad habit about my bathing. She made me bathe more than I thought was necessary [laughter] . But there was no such  thing as a bathroom. The kitchen was over on the other side where the two bedrooms were. You see, we actually didn&#x27;t need anything but this side of the house, and the kitchen. And there was always those two bedrooms. Sometimes my mother would have a change and the back bedroom would not be set up like a bedroom. But the front one was always a bedroom. I don&#x27;t know why she did that. The only thing I can think of: I remember a couple of times, they had little entertainment, parties—I&#x27;d call them parties—set up in that back bedroom. Everything would be out of it except tables and chairs where they were going to feed and take things in from the kitchen. But the house sat up, like so many Southern houses; there was as much room under that house as there is under this one, almost. And all dirt. And the only thing that kept it up there was lattice work. It was wood. But lattice all around the back of it which was very much like this house, in that the back end was much higher off the ground than the front end. But as a kid, I played up under there all the time. I had more play houses than the law allows. And the one thing that we had—well, everybody didn&#x27;t have; almost everybody in that neighborhood had it. But downstairs there was a water toilet. It had a seat and you pulled the string down like this. So that was a decided advantage that we had in that house.  WALTER WEARE: In Durham you were saying there was a number of these homes that would be kind of .  VIOLA TURNER: Well here—and now I can&#x27;t recall; there may have been; I would guess there were plenty, because now that I&#x27;m thinking about it I know of one place where people used to go to eat. The reason it comes to mind is that somebody made me think of it, really informed me, because I didn&#x27;t know it. I had been to that lady&#x27;s home once to eat dinner, because she fixed dinners, and you could go to her house to eat dinner. And very recently somebody informed me that she was the mother of an artist that is really beginning to become pretty well-known out in California, named Barnes. He has been here and had his art work in the student union building a couple of times. And I understand that he has really become recognized as having some artistic abilities. And someone told me that that is this woman&#x27;s son. And I think there were two or three places in Durham where people cooked meals and you could go and eat. Later there was something even a little better than that. But, in the meantime, everybody virtually who. . .well, I&#x27;ll tell you. The people I know about, but I&#x27;m sure this was more or less a sort of a habit. Officials from North Carolina Mutual invited people to come to their homes. You see, if they were coming to Durham they wrote to whomever they knew best, ‘I want to be there for such-and-such a day’. And very likely that simply meant that you were coming to their home to stay until whatever it was you had come to Durham for. So, many, many people were accommodated that way, from the people they knew in Durham. And then people in Durham, like everywhere else, if two or three people were coming and you couldn&#x27;t accommodate them, you may ask a friend. Like I&#x27;d call Eula and say, &quot;Eula, please, would you take so-and-so coming to see me; I&#x27;ve already got somebody.&quot; Because I only have one bedroom. And she&#x27;d say, &quot;Sure.&quot; I&#x27;ll give you a real good example. At one period here, they decided to give me one of these ‘This is your life’ visits. And my stepmother and her sister, a cousin from Jersey, my half-brother and his wife from California—I think that&#x27;s it—all came to Durham and were here and housed, and I hadn&#x27;t the remotest idea anything in the world was happening until, at the forum, Kennedy walked up to me and said, &quot;This is your life, Vi Turner.&quot; And they almost had to deliberately pick me up and carry me up on stage, because I thought he was kidding me. And lo and behold! Out of all of it there were all these people right here in Durham. A part of them were down to Eula&#x27;s, part of them were at another friend&#x27;s house. And, of course, my brother, he and his wife, they had driven all the way across from L.A., and they got here with the program being held, at the time they got here. And the wife would not get out of the car. She wouldn&#x27;t come in. She said, not the way she looked. But, you know us, my brother walked right in to the program. And that&#x27;s been the way it&#x27;s been done, all over the South, I think.  WALTER WEARE: Was there a grapevine, where you knew, if you were travelling, where you might stay?  VIOLA TURNER: You would know, because you made arrangements in front, you know. If you were going somewhere. I never experienced much of that, because in some ways, I guess, I&#x27;m called a little queer. I&#x27;m not very good at visiting. And so, consequently, I couldn&#x27;t make it until there were places you could go, to a hotel. All of my travelling has been like that. A lot of our people still do that. I have friends right here now. She gets up and goes all over this country, and I doubt if she&#x27;s ever made a hotel reservation in her life. This also is a pattern I think: she is a widow of a physician. And, you know, we all have these little organizations, physicians&#x27; wives organization, physicians&#x27; clubs and things. She can travel all over this country, and she&#x27;ll go from one place to the other. She&#x27;ll stay at some physician&#x27;s home, or some physician&#x27;s widow&#x27;s home. And they, in turn, if they get up and want to go somewhere, it&#x27;s nothing for them, maybe to call from Raleigh, and say, &quot;I&#x27;ll be in Durham in thirty minutes.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#x27;ll be in Durham in an hour.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#x27;ll be there tomorrow.&quot; That friend just makes arrangements for them to come right on over, no problem.  WALTER WEARE: What about people travelling through on business? Let&#x27;s say people working in the South in the nineteen-thirties in the NAACP, would they stop in Durham?  VIOLA TURNER: It&#x27;s the same thing. Friends. Many a time they&#x27;d be at Mr. Cox&#x27;s house. Many of them would be at Bess&#x27;s. She was one of the most hospitable ones. Any number of people could stop at Bess&#x27;s. You&#x27;d call Bess Whitted. They could be there. Certain people—and I say ‘certain people’, if you happen to be friends of theirs, there was always a place for you at the Darnells&#x27;. Maybe one or two people could go to C.C. Spaulding&#x27;s home, the old man. All of us could have come if it had been left with him, but his wife was an entirely different person. Probably the most you could&#x27;ve gotten there was one or two of us, like that. But generally the pattern was—and still is, because most of my friends would go on a trip and let their relatives or friends know they&#x27;re on their way and they go there. I&#x27;m just, as I said, queer; I can&#x27;t do it. I can&#x27;t do it because I couldn&#x27;t stand for you to drop in on me without letting me know. So, I&#x27;ll never be anybody&#x27;s house guest. I just can&#x27;t do that. Now, if I decided to invite you, I&#x27;m delighted to have you, and I&#x27;ll work myself to death to have it comfortable for you. But if I walk to my front door and you&#x27;re standing there, and you&#x27;d come from somewhere, you&#x27;d just have to pick me right up off the floor. Because I can&#x27;t cope with that sort of thing. So, as a result, my whole lifestyle has been governed by that. I don&#x27;t try to never do anything to anybody that I would not like to have done to me.  WALTER WEARE: Can you remember some of the people who came into town, like Dr. DuBois was here one time, wasn&#x27;t he?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. He was here years and years ago. And frankly, I have no idea where he stayed. But I would guess—and I think it probably would be a pretty good guess—he probably stayed at Mr. Spaulding&#x27;s.  WALTER WEARE: What about James Weldon Johnson, do you remember him?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. Oh, boy, I used to read every last thing he ever wrote. I thought I was right good at reciting his stuff. Again, he could have stayed— and DuBois—at Mr. Spaulding&#x27;s, at Mr. Merritt&#x27;s, when John Merritt was living. And Patty, who was his daughter��they could have stayed there easily. Dr. Moore—they could have easily stayed there. Mr. Avery—he had a large home and he was a very gregarious type of person. And if they was bishops or church folks, all of them could have stayed at his house. He was very involved, as a layman, in the Methodist Church. Of course the Spauldings in the Baptist. So all of those people could have stayed at any of those homes. But, by and large, the homes were open to anyone who came to Durham. I mean, anyone that they knew or represented anything of any consequence.  WALTER WEARE: When Paul Robeson, would C.C. Spaulding—because they might have differing philosophies—would he. . .?  VIOLA TURNER: They may have never done anything but met. Paul may not have been impressed with Mr. Spaulding and Mr. Spaulding would have been impressed with him and who he was, and that sort of thing. But they never would have had too much in common. And this is another thing. I would have lost it, but you mentioned it: many people stayed on the college campus. Many came and they were housed there. That I had actually forgotten. But I think that&#x27;s where Paul Robeson stayed. That&#x27;s where Adam stayed most of the time, when we came. Dr. Shepard was quite a character and he loved all of them, you see. And they were quite at home with him. He was not at all the same type as Mr. C.C. Mr. C.C. was a churchman. If you were a bishop, presiding elder, preacher, very likely that would have perked him up to be very sure they were taken care of, even if he wasn&#x27;t taking care of them. Dr. Shepard was entirely different. He liked all styles, all kinds. And he exposed his student body to them. They didn&#x27;t have to have the same philosophy by a long shot. The first memory I have of Dr. Shepard that focussed my attention on him in deep admiration for the rest of his life—I knew him before then; just knew who he was; had been in and out of there—but I went down to the campus on some occasion. I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what it was. Sitting up on the rostrum were several whites. And they were influential whites. Whites who were over at the legislation, of the legislative body themselves. And, of course, you know, they were democrats. Did you ever see Dr. Shepard?  WALTER WEARE: Victor Bryant senior, would that be one of the people?  VIOLA TURNER: If so, he wouldn&#x27;t have been there this time, because when I came to Durham, he had died. I knew Victor Bryant, the young one, who is now the senior. I saw him get religion. I know the time when he was real tough to get along with. But anyhow, everything around the rostrum were democrats. Dr. Shepard was a republican. He made no bones about it. And he had to go to the North Carolina Legislative Body to get any money he was going to get, to help him with his school. So he got up, a tall, slim man. He had kind of a whine and talk, you know. &quot;Heh, heh, heh, heh,&quot; he&#x27;d say, &quot;this is Mr. so-and-so.&quot; He was quite good. He&#x27;d say what he did and who he was. He ended each one with, &quot;a good democrat.&quot; Blah, blah, blah, blah. &quot;This is Mr. so-and-so; good democrat. They hold the money strings, you know.&quot; But before he finished his conversation:&quot; `Course, all of them know, as well as you do, that I am a good republican.&quot; [laughter]  &quot;But I&#x27;ll go over  there to see about our funds, you know; we&#x27;re trying to do this. . .&quot; and go right on. And they took it. And he got his money. He was heartless; he could do that. But he could fit into anything. He was a remarkable man. I remember the first time I went out and sat in his office, really, just a social visit. Mrs. Whitted, Bess Whitted, had lived with them, when she came to Durham a younger woman. He had been with his mother, rather. So she knew them all well. So whenever we wanted to put on a program, or wanted to bring some artist to Durham, we&#x27;d go down there and try to talk Dr. Shepard into letting us use the auditorium—which we did many times. Then, of course, we&#x27;d have to go into all of the details with him. What sort of money we were going to charge, and what we were going to have to pay, and what we were going to do for the school. Usually it was some sort of scholarship effort. So, I&#x27;m sitting over there feeling very impressed with Dr. Shepard, and the president. And I&#x27;m the little secretary, you know, just tagging along with Miss Bessie. He says, &quot;Heh, heh, heh, heh, well, now. How are you and Wilbur getting along?&quot; I sit up, &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;Heh, heh, heh. You didn&#x27;t know that I knew that you were going around with Wilbur Wright, did you?&quot; Lord! I didn&#x27;t know he even knew I existed. So I squirm and I say whatever. He goes right on talking to Bessie. &quot;Well, let me see here.&quot; He kept everything under the sun in that office; everything that you can think of. &quot;Now I want you to bring this back, but I think maybe you would enjoy reading this.&quot; This would be some good book; maybe something just recently published, you know. Well that sort of makes me feel a little more comfortable and I thank him and sit back. Then he goes on and after a while he turns around, and right out of the blue he asks me some other personal question. Which means that he knew everything, like, &quot;Well, you came from Arkansas, here, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; Well, you just couldn&#x27;t imagine a man at that level, knowing little details about little insignificant somebody like me. That would just tickle him to death. After a while, &quot;Well, Bess, let me see.&quot; He&#x27;d get up and walk into his little inner office and come out there with a package for her. &quot;This is for you. Now, you can&#x27;t give her any of that; she&#x27;s too young for that. But, well. . .&quot; He&#x27;d reach over here. &quot;Here, you can have this.&quot; He had brought her out a bottle of Canadian Club. He knew she liked Canadian Club. So that&#x27;s what he&#x27;d given her. He&#x27;d gone over here and gotten me some candy and handed me a box of candy or something like that. Then he&#x27;d get right on back down to business. You&#x27;d go back with what you wanted with him; what he was going to do; how much he would do of what you had asked. But he was a remarkable man. And boy, when I was walking my dog, in those days on the campus, it didn&#x27;t make any difference what time you were there—early or late—you&#x27;d walk in on him somewhere on that campus. We used to be in plays and he&#x27;d let us come down to the building that used to be right on this street, but it was burned: Chidley Hall. He&#x27;d let you go there to rehearse. It was nothing for you to be rehearsing, and somebody else would be rehearsing and you&#x27;d walk over to a window and stand there, and you&#x27;d look right into Dr. Shepard&#x27;s eyes. Because he&#x27;d be out there looking in, to see what you were doing. He kept that campus right in the palm of his hand.  WALTER WEARE: So he was to the campus kind of like Poppa Spaulding was to the Mutual?  VIOLA TURNER: Owned the whole shebang. Or at least they felt they did. Of course, they pretty nearly ran it, too.  WALTER WEARE: Did they cooperate kind of as community leaders?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes, he—and there was another man here, Professor Pearson; he was the principal of the high school.  WALTER WEARE: W.G. Pearson.  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. Pearson, Shepard, and Spaulding. They were very closely associated and they all had the whole interest. Not only what they were doing themselves, but the entire interest. And they cooperated with each other for any effort that you were putting on. Anytime that Dr. Shepard wanted anything from North Carolina Mutual, Mr. Spaulding delivered. Yes. It was a very closely-knit association and it was a beautiful one. It wasn&#x27;t one where you could ever object to it one way or the other. Or, I couldn&#x27;t. They needed each other. They needed support. They gave each other support.  WALTER WEARE: Even though they didn&#x27;t always agree?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, no, no.  WALTER WEARE: Spaulding was a democrat too? And Shepard a republican?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. I don&#x27;t know whether they ever discussed it, because Dr. Shepard just made his statements and what you weren&#x27;t supposed to discuss with him, you just didn&#x27;t. However, Spaulding was a very volatile man, so they could have. But I doubt if either of them did. Because I would guess, in that day and time, they were what they were because they believed in what their party was saying. But I don&#x27;t think either one of them would have fought each other over it. Because they knew neither one of them was worth a cuss, you know. So, I doubt if it was that bad. Speaking of that, this is maybe something that&#x27;d interest you. Mr. Spaulding took me the first time that I was able to register, or was registered. I don&#x27;t know if I ever knew anything about registration before. Mr. Spaulding would take some of us from the office down to the courthouse to register. And the day that he took me down—there were about three or four of us that went down.  WALTER WEARE: All Mutual people?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. I would presume that was being done by other leaders—doing the same thing. But I don&#x27;t know. Because that was all very new to me then. I knew nothing about registration. I knew you were supposed to vote, and that you ought to definitely be voting, but I had not come up with that you had to be registered, or anything of the kind.  WALTER WEARE: Had your parents voted in Georgia, do you think?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh I&#x27;m sure my parents hadn&#x27;t. I feel very sure they had not. Because, as I told you, the first time that I knew anything about it, I was at Morris Brown and my mother&#x27;s dead. I was at Morris Brown when Harry Pace, and Ben Davis and those men came to the school and started indoctrinating us, really informing us, I say indoctrinating, but that&#x27;s a good word, too, I guess. Any rate, up until then, no, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever heard the word, ‘vote’, meaning something pertaining to me. I guess maybe I&#x27;d heard the word because I read very early and read anything and everything that could be written. If it were anywhere within my sight I read it. So I may have seen the word, but it had no significance to me until I got to Morris Brown.  WALTER WEARE: Mr. Spaulding, then, would take new employees?  VIOLA TURNER: No. He was taking old employees. Because, you see, at that time, that was the beginning of registration here. Very few people, blacks, had been registered.  WALTER WEARE: This is the nineteen-twenties?  VIOLA TURNER: Well, I got here in &#x27;24, so it must have been probably the first year I was here. Because he was taking just three or four at a time down. They had probably been battling it out, arguing it out, how it was going to be done, but he and some of the leaders must have been putting up quite a fight, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s got to be done.&quot; So, they worked out the way it&#x27;s going to be done. So, they&#x27;re going to take a few at a time down there. And only somebody like Mr. Spaulding probably could get you registered. I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it. All of it that&#x27;s true. I imagine that if I walked down there to be registered, I never would have gotten registered. Listen, this, to me, is the priceless part of that. We walked down there. There sits a man with his book, and then his bible. I believe it was a bible; I might be wrong. But any rate: a book. So he hands you that to read. That&#x27;s no sweat. I read what he said, what is there. So he gives me the privilege. He writes my name down, address, and whatever else goes with it. Next girl comes up. He gives it to her. She reads, and he says to her. &quot;That&#x27;s not correct.&quot; I think that was about the third. I think two of us got by before we questioned him. But any rate, when he questioned her, he tells her the word she&#x27;s mispronounced. And, would you believe it? You would never know; you&#x27;d never recognize that word. So he reads the sentence and you&#x27;d never heard such reading in your life. For somebody sitting up there telling you you can&#x27;t read. Well I [laughter] , I  just stood there looking. Mr. Spaulding didn&#x27;t make any display of his temper, which he had plenty of, and would, on occasion. But he did say, &quot;Well, when can she come back to register?&quot; And that rascal told him, &quot;When she could read what he gave her to read,&quot; or something like that. She did go back and she did get registered later. Mr. Spaulding saw to that. But I would like is for anyone else to have been present to hear that man read, and hear the word that he called her on, hear what he called it. We snickered all the way back to the building, as soon as we got out of his office. Because it tickled us to death. Of course, you know, we were laughing but we were indignant—mad as we could be. The idea! And, of course, the girl was embarrassed in there. But when she got on the outside and when we got through with her, she was just ready to go back and do it again. Now, that&#x27;s how you got registered here in Durham at that time. Somebody that they knew they couldn&#x27;t say no to, that had some pull somewhere, took you down personally.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  VIOLA TURNER: She&#x27;s still living, and I just learned that she&#x27;s living very near me, where she used to live, once upon a time. But that old rascal couldn&#x27;t read a lick himself, but he did that to us. And I am quite sure that we didn&#x27;t have a rough time at all. But can you imagine somebody else who tried to go in there and get registered, and they didn&#x27;t have a C.C. Spaulding standing right there with them?  WALTER WEARE: Now, there was an effort, though, beginning in the late twenties, to do something about that?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. That was the beginning. I believe that was the very beginning. I don&#x27;t know that, but I believe that was really the beginning. But NAACP had been fighting for many years and still was. And still is, for that matter. But we began to form these committees. What is now the committee. . .  WALTER WEARE: Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: What used to be the Durham Committee on  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. I was trying to go back to how it used to be. But the birth of that began to come.  WALTER WEARE: Can you remember the steps leading up to that? That&#x27;s, I think, in the mid-thirties.  VIOLA TURNER: The only thing that I remember about it is in the early years. Since we&#x27;ve been talking I&#x27;ve been trying to think of that one man, that, if he is still living, he&#x27;d be somebody who could tell you all that story.  WALTER WEARE: Was he a lawyer?  VIOLA TURNER: No. And that&#x27;s why this particular memory to me is such a beautiful one. I went to several meetings. I started to say ‘formative stage’. But I guess formative stage, when you think about how it has developed and what it has become. So, it was in the earlier years of it. People would meet. You&#x27;ve probably run into this is your history about Durham. The tennis clubhouse up here?  WALTER WEARE: Yes. The Algonquin?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. Well, at that time that was another one of the meeting places. Incidentally, there were a few bedrooms upstairs there where people were housed. And, at one time, we had delightful food served there. I used to take often.  WALTER WEARE: Who built that? And how was that financed and taken care of?  VIOLA TURNER: Well, you can thank Bess Whitted and W.D. Hill as the two people who were more responsible for the development of that club than any others. Although, it was a Durham effort. There were many, many people here who did participate. I was a member for years and years, and paid dues. And many, many people were like that. But the moving force was Bess Whitted, because she loved tennis herself. She played some tennis. She wasn&#x27;t ever great, but she was loyal and faithful to it. And she was the making of many a little black child that had never seen a tennis racket. They were not out of the homes of the people we&#x27;ve been talking about. They were urchins from all around. They gathered there and Bess was really one of the moving forces there, and developed some very good tennis players. And Billy Hill was also a moving force there. They were not alone I don&#x27;t mean there were none other, but they were the ones who were there in the beginning, and they stayed right there. When it wasn&#x27;t doing, they were there, and when it was doing, they were there. Most of Durham, and certainly all of the Mutualites—and many other citizens of Durham—supported the clubhouse for many, many years. Just in very recent years have some others stopped paying dues there. I think they have finally sold the property, but for years they would not sell it, because it was really serving a real need in Durham.  WALTER WEARE: John Wheeler was a great tennis player.  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes, yes. So he was a great supporter of the clubhouse, too.  WALTER WEARE: There&#x27;s a story—it may be entirely untrue—that he had something to do with the development of Arthur Ashe. Have you ever heard that?  VIOLA TURNER: No, I haven&#x27;t. But that does not make it untrue, and I&#x27;ll tell you why. Were you ever told that a Dr. Johnson also had something to do with the development of Ashe? I think he did. There was a doctor in, I believe, Lynchburg, Virginia, who was quite a tennis enthusiast. Probably quite a tennis player at some time, I don&#x27;t know. But he was certainly an enthusiast, and a developer of young people. One of the people that I know about, that he was instrumental in getting going was a woman, who became quite a tennis player. She&#x27;s still living, too. I think she has gone into golf, now. But she did some outstanding winning; I can&#x27;t recall what.  WALTER WEARE: Thea Gibson?  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s right. Well, this man, Johnson, was quite, quite responsible for her. John and Johnson worked very closely together. That&#x27;s why I say, anywhere you hear Johnson&#x27;s name attached to Ashe, I would be quite willing to believe that Wheeler had something to do with it, too. Because they both worked very closely wherever they saw promising young people, in tennis especially. I never remember John saying anything about Arthur Ashe as such, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a thing. He could well have had, because he was also the type of person—as you probably already know from his history—wherever there seemed to have been a bright spot, or the possibility of one, you could find John trying to do something about it, or trying to help. So he may have had a good deal to do with it. I don&#x27;t know.  WALTER WEARE: Well, this club, you were saying. . . .  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. And it was a meeting place. It was a meeting place for everything. The men&#x27;s bridge club met up there. Many times co-ed clubs, I guess you&#x27;d call them, the younger fellows and girls. We&#x27;d have clubs and we&#x27;d meet up there. And any other kind of meeting. NAACP meetings met up there. And then when this organization was formed, they met there. So it really served exactly what it said: a clubhouse. Long after there was very little tennis. Now, when I first came to Durham, that was the way we spent our afternoons. We&#x27;d come home from work in the summertime and get dressed and walk down to the tennis court to see tennis. And we saw some beautiful tennis. Because people came from Virginia and other parts of North Carolina. And some of our best tennis players played right down there on that court. That&#x27;s the way we spent our evenings.  WALTER WEARE: I want to get back to the Durham Committee.  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes. Well the only thing I started to say there about it, that I wish I could remember. I went to a meeting. I used to go occasionally. I wasn&#x27;t one of those people who was at every meeting or anything, but in the earlier days I used to go occasionally. And I went there one night and I don&#x27;t know what happened. John either had to leave the meeting, or he found out late that he couldn&#x27;t be at the meeting, and they were just getting back knowledge in the evening, that he would not be there to preside. Two things impressed me that I still remember. The first thing was the cross-section. There were people from every walk of life at that meeting. People you knew; people that you knew what they did; people that you had heard of; people that you&#x27;d never heard of; people that you&#x27;d never seen. But many of them, they would maybe get up to say something and you&#x27;d say, &quot;Oh, yeah, that&#x27;s such-and-such a section&quot;, where they named ‘East End’, or ‘West End’. And I said to myself that I know the area, that&#x27;s all. But not a single person that got up to say anything at all, every last one of them had something to say. They may not have said it exactly like you would have said or like I would have said it, or John may have said it, but you understood it perfectly; and you appreciated it; and you recognized it. You recognized every comment they made, one way or the other. Well, that, to me, was impressive. I had never been in a group where you knew these were all different types of people, but they were there with just one single thought: and that was improvement. And out of that—and this man that I have seen and I know his name, but it escapes me, and I haven&#x27;t been able to think of it. I even have tried to think of who I could call and they would tell me who it is. But this man got up and took charge of the meeting, and, by golly, John could not have done any better than he did. I can just see him. He was tall, slender, very dark brown skin, not educated like John. He could easily not even have had a high school education. But he spoke well. And he took charge of that meeting with the same ease, the same grace, or whatever you want to call it, as anybody could have. And I left there the most impressed person, you know, over it, because I was so delighted. After that, I sort of just followed, you know, wherever I&#x27;d see anything about him.  WALTER WEARE: He remained active in the Committee?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, yes, he was.  WALTER WEARE: Was he a tobacco worker, or anything?  VIOLA TURNER: Could have been. He was probably a tobacco worker. Or, if he wasn&#x27;t that, he was some other worker. He was no one that I had come in contact with as such, knowing him from working in the Mutual or working in the Savings and Loan, or working in the bank—working in any place, you know, that I had come in contact with anybody.  WALTER WEARE: Was the labor union represented or active in those meetings?  VIOLA TURNER: They became. When you said labor union, I&#x27;m trying to think if that man was a member of the labor union, but I&#x27;d be afraid to say that, because I&#x27;m too vague on it. But, yes, I do know that members of the labor union, and I think they are still, very active in that organization. I know they have been and I think they still are.  WALTER WEARE: John Wheeler worked with—this is Tobacco Workers International?  VIOLA TURNER: John could work with everybody and anybody and they had to respect him. And yet he worked with them, and they could disagree right down to the nth degree, but nine out of every ten times they&#x27;d work out some kind of way that they could work together. There&#x27;s a man here in Durham, and I think that he is an international officer, a member of that group you&#x27;re talking about, named Hobby. Have you heard the name, Hobby?  WALTER WEARE: How do you spell it?  VIOLA TURNER: H-O-B-B-Y. I know that our Committee has worked with Hobby and Hobby has worked with the Committee. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s a member or anything of the kind. But I do know there&#x27;ve been plenty times we were on the same side of an issue.  WALTER WEARE: John Wheeler was not the first leader of the Durham Committee? There were earlier people? Do you remember?  VIOLA TURNER: I couldn&#x27;t tell you that. I mean, and be the least bit accurate. I&#x27;m not sure. Because that was a pretty early meeting that I went and was so impressed. And it seems to me that it was John who was not there then. What I kind of think is true—now, I&#x27;m not sure this is true. There are people here who can give you a far more accurate picture of that. And Babe Henderson may be one of them, if you have not talked with him.  WALTER WEARE: Or  VIOLA TURNER: Oh yes, he would. But my feeling is that John served that Committee more times than once. He stepped down for somebody else, then he came back in, and that sort of thing. And I sort of think he was in very early.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember the NAACP being here before that Committee?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, I think I do. In fact, I know I do that. The NAACP was here before anything. In fact NAACP was anywhere I&#x27;ve ever been, before anything else.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember any of the Durham organizers?  VIOLA TURNER: No, I don&#x27;t know who they were. No, I really don&#x27;t.  WALTER WEARE: Do you know R. McKentz Andrews?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, I knew him. But, you see, the way I knew him: he had been here before I came to Durham. He had written the book on John Merritt&#x27;s life, and had left. And then he came back here after I came here. And it was at that time that I knew him, and came to admire and respect him greatly, too. Because he was a stickler for accuracy and perfection.  WALTER WEARE: When DuBois was here, did you meet him?  VIOLA TURNER: I don&#x27;t recall that I did. I guess I recall his being here, and what I would think is that I was just duly impressed, as a young man, at Dubois. Of course I knew who he was. And I&#x27;d known of him before I came to Durham. But I would guess that I did not meet him. Maybe he went through the building. I may have even been the person who carried him through the building, that sort of thing. But nothing more than that.  WALTER WEARE: Did everybody read The Crisis is those days?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, The Crisis was a thing that most people knew about. At least I knew about, and I don&#x27;t think I was unique.  WALTER WEARE: Was Marcus Garvey ever in Durham?  VIOLA TURNER: Not to my knowledge. If he was here, he came before my time. Because I would have remembered Marcus Garvey coming here I think. I don&#x27;t think he could have come without me knowing, because I&#x27;d been aware of him a long, long time.  WALTER WEARE: Was there some kind of community opinion?  VIOLA TURNER: I would guess this, and this, again, is purely a guess. I would guess that we would not have had any appreciation for Marcus Garvey. I have what I think may be a sound basis for that; it isn&#x27;t necessarily true. But we had a man here named C. Benjamin Curly, who came from New York City. A very well-trained man, a brilliant man. He was too far ahead of us when he came through. Among the things that I can point to as evidence of that was among the things that Mr. Curly said to North Carolina Mutual was that we should change our system of having a cashier-bookkeeper. That&#x27;s what Bess Whitted was. She was our cashier and she was our head bookkeeper. And Curly told the official family that you couldn&#x27;t do that. That somebody handling your money was keeping record of your money. What you need is a comptroller. Well, Bess had a reputation for being an honest woman. The first thing I ever heard about her was she had been working for North Carolina Mutual for twenty-five years and had never missed a penny. When I came here, I looked at that lady, twenty-five years [whistling]. Good Lord! I wouldn&#x27;t stay nowhere twenty-five years! So, that was rather offensive to Bess, the idea of you talking about taking one of the things away from her. And, for the others—and this may be an unkind observation, but it&#x27;s one I had then, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve changed it at all—our men were not too happy about your being too intelligent. A pretty natural thing. What you don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;re kind of fearful of. And so they looked at Curly with the slight suspicion that perhaps this is a recommendation or an idea to build yourself. You want to be the comptroller, and so you say this is not the way it&#x27;s done. That&#x27;s the sort of reasoning, I think, that was behind that. Because we really are timely people; we never hired anybody. But when there was a need for somebody to help out a sister company, that was trying to reorganize or get some things going, we were quite generous and willing to let Mr. Curly go and help them, until they got straightened out. Then, of course, he was to come back to us. It took several years before the Insurance Department, I believe it was, or some of their examiners—it may have been an that came, Mr. Bilts. But any rate, someone with a certain amount of authority said, &quot;You can&#x27;t do this. You can&#x27;t have a cashier-bookkeeper.&quot; And then we believed. Curly had told us that. And he was capable. He was a person who could have really done the job for us. But we were careful. Now, of course, it was something for a little secretary to be making a decision like that, wasn&#x27;t it? But that&#x27;s the way I felt about it then. I had great admiration for him. I knew him and knew the family. Only after I met them there. I don&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;d ever known them before. I recognized the quality of the man.  WALTER WEARE: We were talking about the Garvey movement, now. Was he linked up somehow?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. Now, Curly came from New York, and he had known Garvey. And not only that. I don&#x27;t know how a firm Garveyite he was—maybe he wasn&#x27;t a firm Garveyite at all. But he did not have the same attitude about Garvey and Garvey&#x27;s ideas that I had always heard in this area. And anywhere I heard anything about Garvey: Garvey was trying to take us all back to Africa, and we weren&#x27;t going. That was our attitude more or less. And this man didn&#x27;t have that attitude. He spoke of Garvey with a certain amount of respect. The man has an idea and it has its possibilities. Maybe it can&#x27;t be done exactly the way he&#x27;s doing it; but it isn&#x27;t a thing to be dismissed. I&#x27;ll put it that way. And, of course, it was the first time I had ever heard anybody speak with any sort of feeling that maybe it&#x27;s a time to be objective. Don&#x27;t just close your mind and say there&#x27;s nothing to the whole thing. Although he didn&#x27;t go around preaching Garvey&#x27;s philosophy, but, if you were talking with him, which, as I said, I was in and out of his home a good bit. They lived not too far from here and had three very lovely children—not babies, but kids that I could still enjoy. And I could stop in there. And I liked the wife. He gave me an entirely different impression of Garvey, simply because, in talking about him, he didn&#x27;t say the same things with the same force and the same tone of voice that I&#x27;d heard all the time.  WALTER WEARE: Do you know if there was a chapter of the Garvey Movement in town?  VIOLA TURNER: No, I don&#x27;t think it ever got that close to Durham at all. The only thing you knew about Garvey was what you read in the black press. And, you know, we used to have a lot of black press: the Chicago Defender, the Courier, and all of the black papers. EVerybody wrote about Garvey. But I don&#x27;t think there was ever any kind of movement here. If so, I never knew about it. Which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that there wasn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t know everything. And certainly, at that time, I wasn&#x27;t interested in much.  WALTER WEARE: You were talking about folks who came to town, or didn&#x27;t come to town, can you remember others? Well, let me mention some. Mary McLeod Methuen. was she here often?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, she&#x27;d been here. While I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to say this as a fact—well, maybe the best way to say that is: yes, she has been here. She has been brought here to speak, and that sort of thing. I hesitate to say who brought her here, who sponsored her coming. But, yes. And I do know this: I know that she has been on Dr. Shepard&#x27;s program. Because that&#x27;s where I heard her, in his Chapel.  WALTER WEARE: I&#x27;m thinking about the Forum that you used to have on Saturdays, the people who would come there. Do you remember some of those figures?  VIOLA TURNER: Well, I guess the most exciting one that I recall—you mean at our Forum, the Forum—was Mrs. Roosevelt. I think she was the most exciting one for me. And I think the reason she was the most exciting one for me was the fact that I had been very ugly. I was in the executive secretary area, you know, just the three of us down there, and very frequently I was called on to do little things, like go out and get a corsage or even call to say, ‘what do you think we should do?’ So, when we got the word that Mrs. Roosevelt wanted to stop at the Mutual, the building started jumping. And particularly our official family. Oh! [whisper, whisper, whisper]. I can&#x27;t tell you to save my life except that I am just a queer person at times. I got thoroughly disgusted. Why in the world do they have to jump up and turn handsprings just because Mrs. Roosevelt is coming? I am so sick of the way we just cow-tow. . So she&#x27;s coming, so what? Now that was my attitude Very sick and disgusted with them all. And I&#x27;m sure I was saying it to the other secretaries, ‘don&#x27;t they make you sick?’  WALTER WEARE: Did they share your feelings, the other women?  VIOLA TURNER: I don&#x27;t know. I imagine so. But I do remember my own, because I was very vocal and very ugly. And then, of course, Mr. Kennedy calls me: ‘what are we going to do?’ Well, I guess I was always secretary first, so I said, ‘Well, I know we should give her a corsage.’ ‘Well, you go out and get her a lovely corsage.’ So I went out and got the lovely corsage. But I&#x27;m talking about them all the time, in my mind, and to the girls. But I, of course, did get her a lovely corsage. I couldn&#x27;t do anything wrong in that area. So now, we go up to the Forum, and I go up there with that same attitude, always got to be making a to do of this. And that lady walked in the door, honey, I before she hit. . .she didn&#x27;t do nothing but walk in and turn and smile [laughter] . I  was putty in her hands from the moment she walked in there. She was the most charming, the most delightful visitor that I had ever seen come through those doors. I can&#x27;t explain it. I think she was a wonderful woman, but the way that struck me and the way that turned me around that quickly, I have thought of it many times and laughed and said, ‘Well that must be like people I&#x27;ve heard talk about getting religion, make them start shouting and say they&#x27;ve got it.’ You know, she walked with a stride. And she turned. And, of course you know, among the things I&#x27;d said, from pictures, she didn&#x27;t look like anything, either. And when she walked and she just turned to. See, she&#x27;s walking and we&#x27;re sitting this way. And she turns around and she smiles. And I don&#x27;t know whether she said, `Good afternoon&quot;, or &quot;Good morning&quot;, but she smiled and spoke. And they ushered her over to have a seat. I just feel like a ton of bricks for that lady. And by the time it came to give her that corsage, I was the happiest person in that building; I really was. And from that moment on, I don&#x27;t think she ever gave another thing that I wasn&#x27;t reading about it, thinking about, talking about it. The funny thing about it, I don&#x27;t recall ever having a reaction like that about a visitor coming. I was always one of those who wanted to put our best foot forward and do for them. But I acted actually horrible all the time before that lady got to us.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember what she talked about at all?  VIOLA TURNER: No. Not at all. I probably didn&#x27;t hear her then. I&#x27;m just sitting up there drooling. But I do know this: she swayed the whole audience. I know that. Everybody was delighted. But only one or two ever knew what she had done to me. Because I had not expressed all those little ugly things to anybody but just the two girls on my floor.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  [TAPE 3, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  VIOLA TURNER: Mr. Spaulding got very excited about him and went out and got him a very pretty piece of luggage. So that was another thing.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Was he still small? Were they still making the Our Gang movies?  VIOLA TURNER: No. But there hadn&#x27;t been a long space between when they were still making them and when he came here. He was not a grown man. He was still a young fellow. We had so many people. Almost anybody you could name had been through the Mutual at one time or another, while I was there. But only where some specific thing makes them stand out, I can&#x27;t remember. But few people came to Durham that didn&#x27;t come there. And all types of people. All races of people. In later years, I think one of the most exciting visitors we had was  WALTER WEARE:  VIOLA TURNER: That&#x27;s right. His entourage, his wife, and a whole group of them. That was exciting. Of course you know Esa—this is a much later period in the life of the company—but, he had a thing about bringing every top-flight businessman he could find through. And you had dinners and meet them. And with me I forget, two minutes later, who they were. ‘Oh yes! With I.B.M.!’ Or with so-and-so. But back in the earlier days, I doubt if many people came to Durham and didn&#x27;t stop by. Of course, we were always welcoming people, wanting them to come. And many came simply because of the fact that we were sitting right in the heart of the city, and a black company. And they couldn&#x27;t believe it. Or, they had already heard about us and they came to see.  WALTER WEARE: I&#x27;m interested in Mrs. Methuen because I&#x27;m wondering if there were many black women who did come through. Or, to put the question differently, were there many black women, or women like yourself, to look up to?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes. For instance there was a woman here, Professor Pearson&#x27;s wife. Women in that day and time—most of them who were making some kind of contribution— they were usually church women or club women. Women who were members of clubs that Mrs. Methuen was instrumental in getting started, you know, and that sort of thing. This woman, Mrs. Pearson, was one of those sorts of women. They went to various conventions and they came back and tried to start things going here. I don&#x27;t know of anybody here who made a sort of contribution like Mrs. Methuen, or even near like Mrs. Methuen. But in almost every community, as I&#x27;m trying to recall, that I&#x27;ve gone into, there&#x27;s always been two or three very active, very outstanding women, who were involved in all the movements that were around: social or educational. And I&#x27;m quite sure Mrs. Methuen influenced many of them. In this state, however, I don&#x27;t think was any influential thing going there, but they were of a kind. Miss Charlotte Hawkins Brown over here at Sedalia, she was quite a woman, too, in her own right. And almost everyone of the young people, especially of the professional folks here, that type of people—nearly all of those children who left Durham probably in the sixth grade, and finished all of their high school work at Sedalia and left there and went to college.  WALTER WEARE: This was a private, kind of finishing school?  VIOLA TURNER: Yeah, that&#x27;s really what she made of it, virtually. I think I&#x27;m correct: if she was not a New Englander, she was educated in New England. And she felt that you should be given a certain amount of polish, culture, and refinement that you were not getting here. Not many places, either, for that matter. I don&#x27;t think any of the kids in college today have been given any refinement.  WALTER WEARE: It wasn&#x27;t just Mutual children who went to her school?  VIOLA TURNER: No. Almost any child here, about like George Cox, that age. Any parent who had a little extra money at all could make a sacrifice to do it, as my mother and father did for me—that little dollar a month business. They tried to send their kid to Sedalia. And that was not just in Durham. All over. You could go down to Sedalia. The Cox kids went there. I don&#x27;t think all of them, but Nora Mae went there. And I had occasion to go over to visit. Children would be there from all over the country. I was surprised how many different places kids came from.  WALTER WEARE: Do you know anything about the curriculum?  VIOLA TURNER: No. The only thing I know is just from the talk of the kids, and then hearing her talk on occasion. I went up there to one or two programs, and you knew from the way she talked, and if you had contact with some of the children, you knew that she was not satisfied just to give them the A-B-C&#x27;s. She wanted them to have a little more than that. And they lived by that sort of program. The things that they did there had to be done correctly, and rightly. In other words, they were taught how to eat properly, how to set a decent table, from that on out. Music, to have some appreciation of good music.  WALTER WEARE: What I&#x27;m wondering about, in asking about these women, is not only when you were growing up, but throughout life, there were black women who served as, what we now call role models. Who were your heroines?  VIOLA TURNER: Well, mine is a strange story, and it certainly is not going to fit anything that you have in your mind, I don&#x27;t think. And yet, there were women who were influential in my life, and all the way. But when I spoke of Mrs. Thompson, whom I ran into at Morris Brown, I would think she probably more nearly filled the role that you&#x27;re thinking of. Because, not only did I admire her greatly, but I admired her for so many different things. I would love to have been like her. I thought she knew everything. And I thought she was the best of everything. And I liked all of that. And she made demands of you. She didn&#x27;t want anything shoddy from you. She didn&#x27;t accept any substitutes for the real thing. All of which commanded my respect, and I liked that. I had had a teacher in the eighth grade who sort of did that sort of thing to you. When you came into her class, you came into her class prepared. And if you weren&#x27;t prepared, you tried to think of a thousand different ways that you didn&#x27;t have to get to that class. Really, because you just felt like you were not only doing something to yourself, but you were doing something to the lady. She was one teacher that I always thought about as being the kind who really made you tow the mark, and how very wonderful it was that somebody like that had come along in your life. Well, Mrs. Thompson was like that, too. But after that, I ran into, interestingly enough, I was saying something about Mr. Rose, evidently. I don&#x27;t know what prompted it. But, I left home quite early. Because, you see, my mother died. I never lived at home again. I would go home and maybe stay a week or so, and then I&#x27;d be on my way. And as soon as I got out of school, I was definitely on my own, and working. Not that I ever had—I hasten to say this—I never had any feeling that I wasn&#x27;t welcome at home. My stepmother was a very nice person in her own way. And, of course, my father—I always felt he was great. It wasn&#x27;t a matter of feeling unwelcome, but I felt I had to make it. I felt I was on my own and I had to make it. Consequently I went right on out and tried to make it, to the best of my ability. But, I was very fortunate. For instance, I told you I went from Tuskegee to Jackson, Mississippi. And without being able to tell you why I didn&#x27;t want to stay at the place that they had arranged for me to stay, I immediately started making arrangements to move. And one of the first days I was in the office, the girl whose place I was taking, I asked her where she lived. And she told me. And I asked, do you think the lady would take me? So she says, maybe, I don&#x27;t know. But any rate, out of that—and I know you don&#x27;t want to hear all that detail—I did go to see this lady. And they, incidentally, were Coxes, too. Honestly. Mrs. Diamond Cox. And she said no, she wouldn&#x27;t take me. Of course I asked why. And she said that they had been so pleased with this girl who lived with them, that they felt quite sure they could not have another young woman coming in, and they would be equally as pleased. Therefore, they were not going to try it again. And they had had a large family of daughters, and they were all grown. They had only one son, the youngest child, still there. And he was maybe seventeen, eighteen; sixteen or seventeen. Well, I made a proposition. I said, why don&#x27;t you let me come and stay, and I&#x27;ll pay you for the first month. And, if at the end of the month, when I offer you your money, you say no, I&#x27;ll know you mean for me to move. And if you take the money, it means I can stay. And I won&#x27;t argue with you. I won&#x27;t plead with you. I won&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ll just try to make arrangements. So I paid the lady and I went there. And it turned out to be the loveliest experience of all. In a little while the lady was treating me just like I was her daughter. And I felt in love with them, and they seemingly in love with me. And so that was a very nice experience. I left there and I went to Oklahoma City. I went to live with a lady and in a little while she was doing the same thing for me—just as nice as she could be. She treated me just like I belonged in the family. I left there and I went to Arkansas. And there, they had carried me to another place to stay—the boss, whom I was going to work for. The next day at the office, I asked the girl down there was there any place. And I had no reason. I couldn&#x27;t tell you why I didn&#x27;t like the places. They were nice, clean homes and everything. And so, somebody told me about a lady that lived not too far from the office where we were working. She said, if she&#x27;ll take you, it&#x27;ll be OK, but she&#x27;s awful tough. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend her, but if you don&#x27;t want to stay where you are, maybe she&#x27;ll take you. So I went to see the lady, and the lady took me. She not only was not ‘awfully tough’ in my book, but she was even nicer than the other folks. It turned out in Little Rock, I had people there I knew, and I didn&#x27;t realize that I knew them so well. They were the same family that I spoke of: the Johnsons in Macon? My teacher was living out there where she&#x27;s married. And one of the daughters that I was very fond of, had married a doctor and she was living there. So, I hadn&#x27;t been there a week before I had found out they were there and they knew I was there. So, I was invited out to one of their affairs, or something of the kind. Getting the invitation was not that early, but that&#x27;s when I discovered they were there: about a week later. But, about a month later, I was invited to something. And when I told Mrs. Davis about the invitation, she looked at my wardrobe and said, you don&#x27;t have anything to wear [laughter] . I was pretty shocked. Because I  didn&#x27;t know I was in that bad shape. But she knew where I was going, you know. She took me down to one of the biggest department stores in Little Rock and got me the prettiest dress that I had ever had, at that time, since I&#x27;d grown up, and didn&#x27;t have for a long time after that. And the shoes, and everything. And told them to open me an account and she would stand behind the account. I went to that lady&#x27;s party, and I was the most dressed thing you ever saw. But I had that sort of that experience all the way through my life. When I say these people treated me like that, they not only did things like that for me, but they guarded me. If I would get an invitation to something, they&#x27;d say, no; no, that&#x27;s not the place for you; don&#x27;t accept that. Or, somebody would want to take me out. I had to tell them, you know, who it was, and then they decided, no, or yes, that&#x27;s fine; you can go. At a time in my life, that was a wonderful thing to happen to me. See, I&#x27;m out on my own; I don&#x27;t know from nothing; I had grown up in a fairy tale world. I just hit with women who were mothers and had girls as old as I was, you know, and that sort of thing. And they just took me over. Luckily for me, I had grown up being accustomed to obeying my mother and my father. So, I didn&#x27;t resent it. As a matter of fact, maybe that&#x27;s why I got along as well. When they would talk, I would accept what they said, you know.  WALTER WEARE: Were these women housewives?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: Were their husbands professional men, do you recall?  VIOLA TURNER: No. Now, let me see. The Diamond Coxes, Mr. Cox, at this stage in his life, had become an insurance man. He was working for North Carolina Mutual. And his wife, dearest thing in the world, I don&#x27;t think ever as they used to say when I was growing up. Because Mr. Cox got up in the morning, built the fires in all the fireplaces, in the winter. Went out in the summer, in the gardens. And it wouldn&#x27;t have to be winter—this kind of weather, they&#x27;d put fireplaces because of the chill. He&#x27;d go out in the garden and get all of the vegetables they were going to have for dinner that day. Had them all up on the kitchen table; he the porch thing for &quot;dearie&quot;, as he called her. And then, go in the kitchen and put on the grits pot and the coffee. And all she had to do was get up and finish the breakfast, and then get the dinner. And that&#x27;s all she ever done. And he was not only like that, but he even shopped for her. Going uptown and bring her clothes or things of that kind that she wanted. If she wanted to go, she could go uptown, but she didn&#x27;t have to. Then, the next family in Oklahoma—yeah, I go to Oklahoma next. That&#x27;s a really interesting story. Funny, I&#x27;ve had. . . .  WALTER WEARE: The story about going to Oklahoma?  VIOLA TURNER: No, the lady I lived with in Oklahoma. When I got there, this lady had just married. She had been married as a young girl. She and her sweetheart were separated in some way, and she had married another man. They had two children—a girl and a boy. I think she came from Memphis, Tennessee. And they were living in Oklahoma City. And she lived with the man forty years, and he had died. And when I got there, she and her lover—her sweetheart when she was a teenager—had just married. He had been married and living in Guthrie, Oklahoma, which is just up above Oklahoma City, and his wife had died. After the proper period of time, the two of them had gotten married. So, when I went there, she was virtually a young bride [laughter] . But the interesting thing she told me later,  before I left Oklahoma and she had gotten to a place where she talked to me about things like that. She said that she and her husband had lived most of their forty years, more or less, like two men or two women in the house. And so, when he died, she had no hesitancy. She really wanted to get married again. And, I believe, Mr. Martley, was a barber. And the other one, where I lived with Mrs. Davis, in Arkansas, I never did know what Mr. Davis did. But it must have been some kind of laboring work. Because he just got up in the mornings and went to work. And when I come home in the evenings, he would usually have come home. But it certainly was not a professional job. I don&#x27;t know what he did. But they were all housewives. You know, I thought of that one day, after we had talked a little. When you were saying about maybe something I had said had given you that impression—or I know you&#x27;ve heard it many times—about the matriarchal society. I don&#x27;t believe in that. I never have. And I&#x27;ll tell you why. One reason is just exactly what you said. I knew more housewives that didn&#x27;t do a living thing but either have children and rear them, or stay at home, and the husbands provided the livelihood. And in all those I have thought about since that remark made me think of it, I don&#x27;t remember but one husband that I would categorize as milktoast. Of all the different husbands and wives I&#x27;ve known over a period, I don&#x27;t remember but one man that always struck me, that he was a little mamby-pamby that did exactly what his wife said. And that, incidentally, was the girl I told you about, May&#x27;s father. I see my mother as aggressive and those sort of things, but my mother was not domineering. But Mrs. was domineering—told you to do this, do that. Mr. always seemed like he was quite willing just to do what she&#x27;d say to do. In most of the cases that I knew, even in my home where I had the sweetest-tempered, nicest person, there were two or three things that we knew perfectly well, that that&#x27;s what we were going to do. In other words, the only thing I almost got a whipping from my father was for breaking that rule, that you were in the house when he left in the mornings, and he wanted you to be there to greet him when he came in in the evenings. It was so natural that I never thought of it as a ritual until I almost got a licking. You went to the door with him, you walked out the door, you went down the walk to the gate. He kissed you and you stood there waving goodbye, you know, until he turned the corner. Then when he got home in the evenings, he expected, when he walked in the house, for his wife and his child to be there. It was the only regulation or law I ever knew about. But a milktoast wouldn&#x27;t do that, either. Of course [laughter]  I was always  in trouble, because the streetlight was my signal that it was time, wherever you are, to get home. And nine out of every ten times, I would be running in the back gate, when that light would flutter and come on. But if I could get to back gate, I could run up the back steps and get in the house by the time he came in the other door. But I didn&#x27;t always make it. I&#x27;d be almost there. Boy, he was sick of it, I guess. So this day, I come swirling in that back gate and I hit the bottom step and I start up, and when I get there, he&#x27;s standing at the top, pulling off his belt. You could&#x27;ve heard me here. I let out a scream like you have never heard. My poor mother came dashing out of the kitchen to see him pulling at the top of the step with the belt. And she said, ‘don&#x27;t do that; don&#x27;t do that; put the belt up.’ But I stayed down on those lower steps a long time [laughter] . But I also  made it from then on. I got in. I&#x27;d be there. I might be out of breath, but I&#x27;d be there.  WALTER WEARE: In talking about strong fathers, or strong men, you said something a moment ago that might lead one to think that sometimes they were a little too strong. You were talking about Bess Whitted and Mr. Curly, and the notion that maybe the women felt that the men didn&#x27;t want them to appear too intelligent. Am I interpreting your remarks correctly?  VIOLA TURNER: Now, let me see. The men didn&#x27;t want the women to appear too intelligent, is that what you&#x27;re saying?  WALTER WEARE: Yes.  VIOLA TURNER: Well, I don&#x27;t know, whatever I said, if I had that in mind at the time, but I do think this: I think that&#x27;s generally true today. Men aren&#x27;t too particular about your being too obviously too smart. You can be smart, as long as you&#x27;re not obviously smart [laughter] . You know what I mean? In other words, you can be smart and men  appreciate your being smart many times. I think maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s helped me. Most of the men I&#x27;ve come in contact with: Yeah, she&#x27;s smart. But they never thought I was smarter than they were. So sometimes they were underestimating me and sometimes they weren&#x27;t. Because sometimes I was a whole lot smarter than they were. But I was also smart enough not to have acted like I was smarter than they were. Now, I think that&#x27;s the difference. And I don&#x27;t know; maybe nobody likes to feel somebody else is so much smarter than they are. I don&#x27;t know. Because I never had that trouble. I admired anybody who&#x27;s smart, and I&#x27;m trying like the dickens to learn something from them all the time. I&#x27;ve found that I run into people that I could respect. Most of the time I never found anybody who wouldn&#x27;t be quite willing to share with you, if you didn&#x27;t pretend that you knew so much. You just admitted what you didn&#x27;t know; and if you knew it, you&#x27;re quite willing to help. But there are a lot of obnoxious women, who really aren&#x27;t as smart as they think they are, but they try to show off as being very smart. And I think that men do not like to be the lesser of the two. They prefer to be regarded as the smart one, and let the woman come along as almost as smart.  WALTER WEARE: Can you remember being conscious of being discrminated against for your sex as well as your race? Can you remember, perhaps, when you first became conscious that because you were a woman, maybe, something wasn&#x27;t happening that would have happened if you&#x27;d been a man?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, certainly. Plenty of times you know that happened. I don&#x27;t imagine many working women didn&#x27;t realize that. I don&#x27;t know about other areas. Only twice in my entire career did I ever ask for more money, or protest the money I was getting. The first time was a very simple little thing that I couldn&#x27;t quite understand. It was a matter of handling the cafeteria accounts. The cafeteria was under Mr. Merritt at the time; the company was not really operating it, as such. It was supposed to be working on its own, and when it did run short, the company would supplement their account. So that meant that I kept contact with the kitchen and money and that sort of thing. So, for doing that little more, and different from my secretarial work, I was allowed twenty cents a day on my lunch. I soon found out that because it was an allowance handled that way, that I could go to the window, and if there were, say, two pieces of pie—and oh, boy, we had marvelous cooks, so you loved to have whatever was up there—and there were three people in the line, regardless to where I stood in the line, those other two people would get the two pieces of pie and when I&#x27;d get to the window, the pie would be out. Or something similar to that.  [END OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  [TAPE 3, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE B]  VIOLA TURNER: No, really, what she was trying to do, she was trying to operate the cafeteria on a pay-as-you-go basis. In other words, she was a marvelous woman, and that&#x27;s a whole new story. But she didn&#x27;t like for the company to have to supplement the cafeteria. She liked to make the cafeteria pay for itself. That&#x27;s all she wanted to do: make it pay for itself. Well, now, if there were three folks up there and two of them had a dime in their hands, and the other had a I was doomed against the twenty cents. So I could spend my twenty cents the way I wanted. But she didn&#x27;t get two dimes for my twenty cents, you see what I mean? So, after that happened to me a couple of times, I didn&#x27;t complain at the window, but I went down to my boss and said to him, couldn&#x27;t I be given twenty cents a day. Then I could spend it as I wanted it. In other words, I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems. It couldn&#x27;t be done that way. And it never was. Well, I didn&#x27;t get too upset about it, although I didn&#x27;t feel it was fair. And I said that if I&#x27;m going to be allowed twenty cents, I didn&#x27;t see any reason why I couldn&#x27;t get the twenty cents, to spend for my lunch. But that wasn&#x27;t in the program, and therefore I didn&#x27;t get it. That&#x27;s my first time to ever ask for money. Now, this one is an answer to your question. We come along here, and we get to a point where they&#x27;ve got to do something for some of us that have been working diligently. And the company wants to show their appreciation. So they make you an assistant to the Treasurer. That&#x27;s very nice. And you&#x27;re real pleased that somebody&#x27;s taken note that you are really trying to do, you know, and you&#x27;re very happy about it. Well, at the same time that&#x27;s done—usually two or three people get the same sort of thing happen to them. So, in my case, there was another assistant to the Treasurer. Well, that&#x27;s OK; I never had much of a jealous streak in that area. So, that&#x27;s fine. Well, North Carolina Mutual was always very slow. I guess most institutions maybe are. Very slow to add a little money along with the title. That comes mighty slow, but finally you get a little something. And you go along very happy. So, then, after a while, because you&#x27;ve done such a good job, you get to made, not assistant to, but assistant. Now, you know you&#x27;re making progress. And at the same time, a young man comes along and gets made assistant, too. Well, you see, I don&#x27;t mind. But then one day, you suddenly, for some reason or other, inadvertently—you aren&#x27;t even curious at the time—but some way or another something happens, and you discover that the other, the male, assistant is making more money than the female assistant. Now, also, all during that period, you have been hearing from every source, how smart you are, and how unsmart that particular individual is. And you already have your own opinion about how unsmart the individual is, and then you have it verified. And by the same token, you&#x27;ve been told all along the way you&#x27;ve done a good job, you&#x27;re doing a good job, and then you get the promotions that say they mean it. Well, you know, you take that a little while, but you can&#x27;t take it forever. So, when that happened, I mulled it over over an evening, and then, on a Saturday—I believe by then we were not having the Saturday Forum; I think we stopped having the Saturday Forum then. But anyhow, I went from my boss to every single official in that building, and sat down, and made my speech. And my speech was, which I won&#x27;t go all into, exactly the last thing I said to you. ‘You have told me from time to time to time that I was doing a satisfactory job, that I was doing a good job, or that I was doing a very good job. I have heard you, and I agree with you, time and time again, that Mr. X was not. And I know he was not. But I didn&#x27;t complain at all about his promotion. That&#x27;s quite all right with me. But when I see the check, I just want to ask you one question: were you kidding when you said I was doing a good job, or did you mean it? If I&#x27;m not doing a good job, tell me. If I am doing a good job, explain how he can get what he&#x27;s getting and I&#x27;m getting what I&#x27;m getting.’  WALTER WEARE: What was the answer?  VIOLA TURNER: I never had any more trouble with that.  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Is that right? They gave you the raise?  VIOLA TURNER: They couldn&#x27;t answer it. [laughter]  Are you  recording? Well, I&#x27;m not going to mention the name. I had one person to tell me about the difference in our training. This person had gotten these number of years of training. And my response was, ‘He&#x27;s still dumb; can you refute that?’ So I never had any more trouble with that. And I never had another time in my life, I never asked. And I never knew what anybody else made. And I had every opportunity, because all the checks were signed by my boss until I became the Treasurer and I signed them myself.  WALTER WEARE: Are there other times in your life when you were conscious of sexual discrimination?  VIOLA TURNER: Not anything worse than that, nor any more than that. I probably had a little here and there, things, I would guess so. Most women do, one place or another. Some time, for no reason at all, except that they are women. But that&#x27;s the only one that ever hit home with me, that I really was ready to do something about, and did.  WALTER WEARE: What about other women in the company?  VIOLA TURNER: Oh, certainly. I think in our company—and I will always feel that this was discrimination of the worst sort—and that&#x27;s Bess Whitted. Bess did a beautiful job of what she was doing. She was the best we had, and as good as anybody could have had in her day, and in her time. And she did. She might have not done many other things the way you would have wanted them done, or somebody else might not have wanted them done, but so far as her job, and what she meant to North Carolina Mutual at the time, nobody could have done better, I don&#x27;t believe. Yet, she did not make any thing like the progress that I made in later years. And she was there long enough to have made some of it. And when I would raise the question, which I did on more times than once—and she would probably have never realized that I did—I was told two things. One was, she could not handle her financial affairs.  WALTER WEARE: Her private financial affairs?  VIOLA TURNER: Yes, her private financial affairs. Which was quite true, to this extent. And I think there was a clear explanation for that, too; her background and everything probably was why she spent money like it had gone out of style, for clothes. And sometimes they&#x27;d just be hanging there; she wouldn&#x27;t even have worn them. And she&#x27;d have five or six beautiful dresses, or anything else you wanted. And she did that all the time. Now, she paid when she got ready. And so, of course, people would be coming over there to collect, or they might call sometimes. Not often. She was quite a card. She&#x27;d be sitting at her desk. And we had a little glass like this, over here, and she&#x27;s over here. And the man got off the elevator, she&#x27;d look up and she says, ‘Now, Mr. Andrew.’ Now this would probably be the manager of the biggest department store in Durham at the time. ‘Now, Mr. Andrew.’ Right out for all of us to hear this. ‘You may as well get right back on that elevator and go on downstairs. No need coming over here. I don&#x27;t have any money for you. And when I get ready to pay you, I&#x27;ll be over there to bring it to you. And you know I&#x27;ll bring it to you when I have it, or get ready to pay you. No need to come up to my window, just get right on back.’ [laughter] And she would do that to</dc:description>

<dc:description>December 9, 1982.  Ben Bulla interviewing Senator Howard W. Cannon from Nevada.  We are in his office in Washington D. C. and-we will be discussing Senator B. Everett Jordan. Ben Bulla:  Senator Cannon, If you will, tell me when you first met Senator Jordan. Senator H. W. Cannon:  I guess it would have been in January of 1959 because I was elected in the November elections of 1958.  I was sworn in January 1959 and I was put on as a member of the Senate Rules Committee. Senator Jordan was on the committee at that time. BB:  Senator Jordan served as chairman of that committee from 1963 to 1972 and you succeeded him as chairman of that committee. HC:  That is correct.  I served until 1978. BB:  Senator, would you briefly describe the functions of the Senate Rules Committee. HC:  The Senate Rules Committee had jurisdiction over the rules of the Senate.  The Rules Committee as a legislative committee had jurisdiction over all proposed legislation, petitions, messages, memorials relating to the administration of the Senator Office Buildings and the Senate wing of the Capitol; including the assignment of office space.  The Congressional organization, relative to the rules and procedures, and that included the rules governing the Senate galleries --the floor and galleries rules--it had jurisdiction over corrupt practices; over the credentials and qualifications of members of the Senate, including that of contested elections.  That was covered in the privileges and elections subcommittee.  The federal elections generally, including the election of the President, the Vice President and members of Congress.  It had jurisdiction over the Government Printing Office and the printing of The Congressional Record.  The meetings of Congress and the attendance of members; the payment of money out of the contingent fund of the Senate. Presidential succession; the purchase of books and manuscripts and the Senator Howard W. Cannon        -2- erection of monuments to the memory of individuals;  the Senate Library and statuary art and the pictures in the Capitol and the Senate Office Building.  It had jurisdiction over the restaurant of the Senate; The Capital and Congressional office buildings; the Library of Congress; the Smithsonian Institution and the Botanic   Gardens.  Those were generally the jurisdictional coverage of the Senate Rules Committee. As you see it was quite a broad jurisdictional authority, though from a legislative standpoint it did not initiate an awful lot of legislation. It had jurisdiction over the providing of money for the various committees to carry out their duties.  This was an issue that every year we would have detailed hearings on requests of the various committees for these funds. BB:  As a member of this committed you had a chance to observe SEnator Jordan as chairman; can you tell me how he performed his duties? HC:  I thought he was an excellent chairman of the committee.  He was a gentleman in every way.  He gave full consideration to the views of the members of the committee and didn&#x27;t try to impose his judgement on the members of the committee without giving full consideration to the thoughts and concerns of each member.  I served on the committee under the chairman prior to Senator Jordan and then under Senator Jordan, and since I gave up the chairmanship, served under other chairmen and I thought he was an outstanding chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. BB:  Is chairmanship based on seniority? HC:  He is elected, but it is based on seniority. BB:  During his tenure it fell his lot to handle the investigation of Bobby Baker.  Were you on the committee at that time too? HC:  Yes.  The committee did have the rather unpleasant task of carrying out the Bobby Baker investigation during that period of time, and it -3- was handled in a very fine fashion--very fair and impartial fashion by Senator Jordan as the chairman, and he appointed as special counsel to the committee another man from your state.  I can&#x27;t remember his name but he was a very fine country lawyer and he acted as counsel to the committee and to Senator Jordan during that investigation. BB:  You know the press was not always favorable to him during that time.  Back in North Carolina some of the criticism was that Senator Jordan was trying to be overprotective of the President. HC:  Well the press, as a rule, take that position.  If a chairman of a committee is trying to be fair to both sides on an issue, as a rule that chairman will take a lot of heat from the press because the press, in many instances, attempt to be unfair.  They have a preconcieved idea as to what ought to be happening and they are critical of people who lean over backwards in the attempt to be fair to all sides of an issue. I think that happened in the Bobby Baker case--I too, was criticized as because a result of those actions simply/we were trying to do everything we could to be fair to all of the parties involved in that investigation. BB:  In the hearings both sides were given ample time to speak for themselves, were they not? HC:  Yes sir. BB:  Do you remember any other issues that came up during his tenure that were difficult? HC:  I don&#x27;t remember too many issues--! believe we had some contested elections--the Baker Case was the most publicized obviously, and it took an inordinate amount of the committees time and energy because of the length and scope of that case. BB:  How would you describe Senator Jordan&#x27;s political philosophy? HC:  I would say that he was of a conservative nature.  I don&#x27;t remember S&#x27;efiator Howard W, Cannon        -4- precise votes to give you an example, but I do recall him as being what I call of a conservative nature, both fiscally and otherwise.  He was, I know, very careful with the taxpayers money insofar as the rules committee had the authority to dispense of it in connection with giving the committees their operating expenses.  Traditionally we reduced the amount of the request on a regular basis every year. BB:  He managed his companies in a pretty tight-fisted manner and so I suppose his thinking on such things did not change. HC:  Yes I would refer to him as a conservative and particularly a fiscal conservative. BB:  If you had to evaluate him as a Senator overall, how would you rate him HC:  Well I would rate him as a good Senator.  I would certainly have rated him in the top 25 or 39% if I had to go through and rate the Senators who were in the Senate at that time.  He was in the top grouping, and he was a gentleman at all times--a very courtley gentleman.  I had a very high degree of respect for his views and he certainly gave full consideration to my views anytime I had the occasion to discuss them with him. BB:  You brought up my next point.  When he had a question or issue that he was not sure of did he have occasion to consult with you? HC:  Yes on an issue that required some flexibility and input from other people he was always very certain to ask some of our colleagues on the committee for their thoughts and judgements before he would take action. BB:  His decision, then, was tempered by the advice of his peers. HC:  That is correct.  He always gave, what I thought, was full consideration to the views of the members of the committee that he had requested assistance from. BB:  Would you say that he was open minded? Senator Howard Cannon                           -5- HC:  Oh yes.  He certainly was not one that I thought had pre- [tape ends] BB:  Was he inclined to vote along partisan lines? HC:  I don&#x27;t recall any partisanship in Senate action apparent in his position, although there were some issues in connection with the Bobby Baker hearing that the minority members of the committee lined up partisanwise, and as a result there were some votes in that case that became partisanline votes that perhaps would not have otherwise.  He was not that type of person, but for that exception, of being a partisan in his views and in his voting. BB:  He and President Johnson, apparently, were very good friends --were you aware of the close ties between the two? HC:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes he and President Johnson were close friends.  That was a well known fact--of course they both were referred to as Southerners -- but he had a good working relationship with Lyndon Johnson.  They were close friends. BB:  Did you see any similarities in the two personalities? HC:  Well I never particularly thought of it along that line.  Lyndon Johnson was more of an arm-twister in trying to get things done, and worked very hard in having people come around to his way of thinking. I didn&#x27;t see Senator Jordan in that light.  He was very careful not to be an arm-twister nor did he try to impose his views on a lot of other people. BB:  Back home he was known as an effective Senator, but he was not known as a great speaker.  How was he able to bring others to his way of thinking? HC:  He was persuasive in a very gentle--not an overbearing fashionbut a very gentle manner.  He had a gentle way about him and he was persuasive in a rather quiet sort of way.  I don&#x27;t recall him as being overly aggressive at any time in trying to get his particular views across. Seh&#x27;&amp;or Howard Cannon                               -6- BB:  Do you recall any national issuesnow here is one I have heard about--maybe you are aware of this:  He was the first Southerner, I understand, to desert the side of the &quot;hawks&quot; in the Viet Nam war and say, &quot;Lets bring the boys home.&quot;  When he did this the Southern delegation was surprised.  Are you aware of what changed his thinking on that issue? HC:  No I really wasn&#x27;t aware of the fact that he took that position.  You will have to get that from someone else. BB:  The period of time between 1958 and 1973 was a pretty turbulent time in our history; the Viet Nam War; Civil Rights; fiscal policy; national defense, etc.  It&#x27;s always easy to look back and say we should have done so and so.  Looking back on those years is there any way to measure a mans performance over all.  Is there any comment you would like to make about him as a Senator then?  What his over all performance was? HC:  Well I looked on Senator Jordan as a person I considered to be a good Senator.  He was conservative--he was a little more conservative than I was.  I always considered myself a moderate to conservative--he certainly had the best interests of the country at heart in everything that he did.  He was concerned about out national security and he was concerned about our economic health and welfare as well.  He was a supporter, generally, of the Presidents in that period of time as I was and I would just have to say, in thinking backand with the people I served withI think he was a darned good Senator, is the way I would define him. BB:  Were you and he pretty good friends? HC:  Yes we were very good friends.  My wife and I were very close friends with he and Mrs. Jordan and considered them to be good friends of ours, and we were happy to be considered good friends of his.  We thought very highly of them.  I never did see Senator Jordan lose his temper in the Senator Howard Cannon                           -7- time that I served with him in the Senate.  At times you could tell that things didn&#x27;t agree with him necessarily completely, but I never did see him really get upset with anyone nor really lose his temper.  He had a good sense of humor--he could always tell a good Southern story to brini a smile or a laugh from someone, and was just a real pleasant gentleman to work with. BB:  Can you recall any of his humorous stories? HC:  No I&#x27;m not very good at remembering stories, but he had a wealth of good stories that he could tell and I always enjoyed them but I was never able to remember them. BB:  Did you serve on any other committees with him? No, just the rules committee. I understand he served on the James Madison Library Committee. Well the assignment on the joint committee on the library and the joint on printing comes out of the membership on the rules committee. For example, I later served as chairman of the joint committee on the library and also the joint committee on printing.  They were all sort of alternated between the House and Senate, but he was the chairman of the joint committee on the library during a good bit of the time the work was being done. BB:  Did you attend any social functions together? HC:  We attended many of them--at the same social functions--I don&#x27;t know that we ever went together.  We have been a guest in their residence and we had a very nice relationship.  Occasionally I would give him a ride home to his apartment. BB:  Did you ever go on any Senate authorized trips with him? HC:  I don&#x27;t recall.  We may have. HC BB HC Senator Howard Cannon:                         -8- BB:  I&#x27;m curious about your background.  Are you an attorney? HC:  I&#x27;m a lawyer. BB:  As you know Senator Jordan was a business man, and thats where he was weakin legal procedure.  Of course Bill Cochrane was AA. HC:  Yes Bill was his assistant and did a very fine job for him. BB:  Senator, I thank you for your time  is there anything else you would like to add to this conversation? HC:  Well that&#x27;s about all, I&#x27;m sorry I do not recall too vividly many very things that happened in that time frame.  One/difficult one, obviously, for the Rules Committee at that time was the Bobby Baker hearing that went on for a long period of time and it was made somewhat a partisan issue by the minority members of the committee who were trying to embarass the President.  So it was difficult for those of us who were trying to be fair rather than lean in one direction.</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Henry E. Frye grew up in Ellerbe, North Carolina, during the 1930s and 1940s. His parents owned fifty acres of land there, and he describes growing up farming tobacco and cotton for his own family and for other farmers in a system called &quot;half farming.&quot; Frye also discusses attending segregated schools during those years. He recalls that despite segregation, black and white children in the farming community played and worked together outside of school. In the late 1940s, Frye left Ellerbe to attend North Carolina A &amp; T in Greensboro. While there, he became actively involved in various activities, including Air Force ROTC and student government. Following his graduation, Frye served briefly in the military and was stationed in Japan. When he returned, he enrolled in law school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At the time, he was the only African American student. Frye graduated from law school and passed the bar exam in 1959 and opened his own law practice in Greensboro, where he and his wife had settled. In this portion of the interview, Frye describes some of his most memorable cases, most of which involved representing the under-represented. During the 1960s, Frye continued to practice law and became increasingly involved in community activities and politics. In 1969, he became the first African American elected to the North Carolina General Assembly. Serving in the House from 1969 to 1980 and in the Senate from 1981 to 1982, Frye worked to address racial issues in the state legislature. Notably, he introduced legislation to abolish literacy tests for voter registration. During the 1970s, Frye was a founding member of the Greensboro National Bank, which was established to offer African Americans a more discernible role in business. He served as the bank&#x27;s president for its first ten years in existence. In 1983, Frye was appointed to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The next year, he was elected by North Carolina constituents to continue his service on the Court. He spends the final parts of this interview discussing his experiences as a Supreme Court Justice and his thoughts about the role of the legislature and the judiciary in state politics.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Interview with Justice Henry Ell Frye February 18, 1992 February 26, 1992 By Amy E. Boening Law School Oral History Project University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Original transcript on deposit at The Southern Historical Collection Louis Round Wilson Library Copyright ® 1992 The University of North Carolina INTERVIEWEE:  JUSTICE HENRY ELL FRYE DATE OF INTERVIEW:  2/18/92 PLACE:  RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA INTERVIEWER:  AMY E. BOENING TAPE 1 - SIDE A This is Amy Boening in the offices of Justice Henry Frye.  I am conducting our first interview.  It is 5:10 p.m. February 18, 1992. AMY BOENING:  Justice Frye, could you tell us about your background, growing up in Ellerbee, on the farm, being the 8th of 12 children. JUSTICE HENRY FRYE:  Yes, I suppose I can.  The question is where do I start? As you indicated, I was the 8th of 12 children.  Six boys and six girls, born to Walter A. (for Atlas) and Pearl Motley Frye.  Both of them moved to the Ellerbe area prior to the time of my birth and I was born in a small, white wood-painted house.  I recall that because they told me about it and I saw it sometime later.  Ellerbe is a very small town and I was born I suppose within the town limits, but as long as I can remember, we had lived about a mile or so from town.  It was a small farm, little less than 50 acres and we farmed tobacco, cotton, and various other crops -- corn, watermelons, cantaloupes, and beans, you name it.  But the money crops were tobacco and cotton.  In addition to that we farmed other people&#x27;s properties.  There were several of us, so my father kept us busy by farming a lot of other property in addition to that we owned. They had in our area, as I&#x27;m sure in a lot of other areas, what they call farming on halves.  The person who owned the land would furnish the land and would furnish the fertilizer and things of that nature and the other person would farm the property, supply the labor and so forth and then when the crops were sold, you would divide the funds one-half to each side.  So they called that farming on halves.  So we did a lot of that in addition to the farm which we owned.  Also, my father had a truck and so he hauled a lot of wood for people and at times hauled what we call l lumber and later pulp wood.  In addition to that he at times ran a saw mill.  So we had plenty of work to do all of the time. . I went to school there for the full length of my school term which was grades 1-12.  I think I&#x27;m correct on this that at the time I started school you graduated with grade 11, but they changed it to 12 grades. While I was in the 7th grade, I stayed about 12 weeks if my remembrance is right and another student and myself were promoted to the 8th grade, so we really made the 7th and 8th grades in one year, so I still ended up with only 11 years of the secondary education.  The schools at that time were separate -- black and white.  Ours was called Ellerbe Colored High School, even though it had grades 1-12; and the other school was just Ellerbe High School.  However, I checked later to look at my diploma and my diploma has Ellerbe High School, so apparently they did not bother to make separate diplomas for the two schools.  I thought that was quite interesting that all of the correspondence and everything in reference to the school was Ellerbe Colored High School and sometime they would put Ellerbe Negro High School and that type of thing.  But the actual diploma just has Ellerbe High School on it. AB:  At the time, what did you think of schools being segregated? HF: Well, at that time we sort of understood that that was the way it was.  I recall one thing in particular that with our basketball, we did not have a gymnasium and the other school did. I always wondered about that. Why we had to play outdoors on a dirt court while they could go inside.  Interestly enough in the small towns and rural areas and that type of thing, whites and blacks lived almost next to each other.  In other words, our farm was on one side of the road and then on both sides--north and south of our home--were white families. We farmed together and worked together in tobacco barns at night.  I guess you are probably not familiar with that.  In those days, the tobacco once you harvested it, it had to be placed on sticks and placed in a barn.  Then for several days and nights you would have a fire 2 which would heat the barn and we heated it with wood, so somebody had to stay there all night long keeping the wood in the furnaces to keep it warm.  So as kids we had a lot of fun really going from one tobacco barn to another at night, keeping the fires going. We had a lot of fun doing that and we did it, black, white, everybody did it together and it was no big deal.  In the fields where we worked, everybody was the same, but on the weekends, the whites went their way and the blacks went their way.  Usually they had very little contact until Monday morning when time came to start back to work.  At that point those who were workers -- some of course were people who didn&#x27;t have to work and that&#x27;s a different class -- but I&#x27;m talking about the working people, all of us were the same as far as getting out there and doing the work.  That&#x27;s the way it worked. AB:  How early did your mornings start back then? HF:  My father described it as from &quot;cain&#x27;t to cain&#x27;t&quot;, and what he said was that you can&#x27;t see when you start in the morning and you can&#x27;t see when you stop at night.  So the idea was to get up and be ready to go as soon as it was enough light so you could see how to do whatever had to be done.  I recall on occasions going to the sawmill to get lumber to take to the plant and I recall getting there too early and having to wait until we got some light so that we could see how to load the truck.  Of course, we would load the truck and take that and deliver it.  I did that at times even during the school year. We would take a load of wood before I would go to school in the morning.  My older brother, who at that time was beyond high school age, was driving, so I would go with him and we would load the truck and everything, and I would come back home and eat breakfast and go on to school.  He, of course, would haul lumber the rest of the day. We understood what work was all about.  Interestingly enough, in the small towns, most farmers did not like to work on a Saturday afternoon.  About 12:00 or 1:00 on Saturday, most farmers quit work and they would go to town to buy whatever you were going to buy or whatever you were going to do.  If there was 3 nothing else to do, some of them would stand around on the street, that type of thing.  Because we had the truck and hauled wood, my daddy kept us working lots of times until almost dark on Saturdays.  That was one of our major complaints--everyone else was off and we had to work, so we were the exception in that sense.   AB: What was your father&#x27;s view of education? Did he push you in that regard too? HF:  Not really.  My father probably, as I recall, had something like a 5th grade or so education.  I think he saw the importance of it and so he always encouraged us to go to school. If things got pretty tight around home, he did not mind keeping us out a day or so to help get some work done.  In those days, only a small percentage of people went to college from that area. He did not encourage us to go, but then on the other hand he tried to help if we really wanted to go.  He was the kind that sort of let you [do] whatever you wanted to do.  In other words, he didn&#x27;t push you or anything of that nature except when it came to work.  He told me that I was awful slow and that I had better go to school, otherwise I couldn&#x27;t make a living on the farm. [laughter]  I remember him telling me that one time that I was too slow to make a living on the farm, so I needed to go to school so I could learn to do something else. AB: What about your brothers and sisters? Did any of them continue on in education? HF:  One of my sisters finished, got her Masters degree.  I believe, we are the only ones who actually got a college education. A couple of my sisters had some college and a couple of my brothers had some technical training of that nature.  Three of my brothers went into service - - two involuntarily and the other voluntarily.  That&#x27;s about the education level. AB:  Did you have a role model when you were in school who encouraged you to pursue higher education? HF:  I had so many it&#x27;s hard to name them all.  I suppose I would start with my Scout master, Mr. Mclntyre.  He was, incidentally, my 8th grade teacher.  He was very strict, but he 4 was the kind who expected a lot of you and encouraged you but was very hard on you if you really didn&#x27;t do what you were supposed to do.  I admired him a great deal.  My agriculture teacher who was almost the opposite.  He was the kind that always encouraged you, but he was not strict at all. There was just something about him that impressed me that he was concerned about us, so that&#x27;s another one. My English teacher I thought was the greatest person in the world in terms of knowledge and things of that nature, and she was also a our class advisor and the wife of the principal. Very different from the principal who was, I thought, in earlier years mean -- but I found out later that he wasn&#x27;t so mean after all.  It was just his idea that he was a strict disciplinarian and the kind of person who just would not take no for an answer.  I recall that our--this is really unusual, you couldn&#x27;t do this today--incidentally, we were a small school. There were 300 to 400 people in the entire school, so you are talking about a small number of people in the classes. With our choir, for some reason or other, none of the seniors were in the choir, and he found out about this one day and he had a meeting with us.  He said, &quot;Starting tomorrow, I want every senior in the choir.&quot; We fussed and complained, but all of us joined the choir.  That was his way of doing things.  If he decided that something was to be done, you would do it.  Some of us didn&#x27;t sing very well, but that&#x27;s the way things went.  But continuing with Mr. Easterling, that&#x27;s his name.  He is well known throughout that area incidentally. Mr. Easterling was the coach of the girls&#x27; basketball team, and they had a great team.  They were really good.  He worked them hard, but he trained them. They were really, really great. We also started a band, and I wanted to play the saxophone.  The band instructor gave me instead a clarinet or trombone or something.  Anyway, whatever it was, I didn&#x27;t like that.  So after a few times, I decided to quit, not play in the band.  Mr. Easterling called me to the office.  Everybody was afraid to go the office. At any rate, I 5 went to the office and he said, &quot;What&#x27;s this I hear about you quitting the band?&quot;  I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t like that instrument.&quot;  He said, &quot;Let me tell you something.  Winners never quit and quitters never win. Now you go back out there and get that trombone or whatever the instrument was and start back playing.&quot; So I did until we had a concert, and I think I must have been off key a lot [laughter] because after that the band instructor suggested that maybe I should concentrate on other things rather than playing in the band, {laughter]  But I have never forgotten the lesson that winners never quit and quitters never win. AB:  Have you stayed in contact with any of your former mentors? HF:  Yes, but most of them are dead now.  Mr. Easterling is dead, Mrs. Easterling.  Mr. Mclntyre is still living and doing well as far as I know.  Several of the others, Mr. Forte is still living.  I always go to see him.  He is still in Ellerbe and doing well as far as I know.  But getting back to people I looked up to, in addition to people around in Ellerbe, I read about Walter White who was active with the NAACP. At that time, Thurgood Marshall was -- I did not really know him at that time, I learned of him later and I was impressed with him at a later time. What&#x27;s the guy that, the famous lawyer with the Scopes Trial.  I remember reading that.  The name escapes me.  But at any rate -- Clarence Darrow, yes, yes, yes.  I was very impressed with him, but at that time really I had no idea or intention of being a lawyer.  The thought of being one barely crossed my mind in spite of the fact that I enjoyed reading about lawyers and things of that nature.  I went through, I guess, a lot of different ideas as to what I wanted to do.  At one time I was going to be a pharmacist.  I thought it would be a great thing, you know, to hand out prescriptions and things of that nature. Then after I went to A&amp;T and took chemistry and took some courses in biochemistry and I really enjoyed that.  I think a lot of it had to do with the teacher who was Dr. Isaac Miller, a very young person who later became president of Bennett College, 6. incidentally.  He was an excellent teacher and, anyway,  I got real interested in that, so I decided at that point that I was going to go off and get a degree in biochemistry.  Then, later I decided I was going to dental school and actually went to the University of North Carolina Dental School in March of &#x27;56 to talk with the persons there about the possibility of going to dental school.  I was told that I needed two other courses that I had not had in physical chemistry, as I recall, and that in any event the earliest I could be admitted would be September of &#x27;57. I was a little discouraged by that and had given some thought to law, based on two or three things. Let me just tell you a little bit about those since we are talking.  Growing up in Ellerbe and with a lot of the things that I saw, I had a very negative idea with regard to lawyers.  I just got the wrong impression I suppose that most of them were very terrible people whose job it was, as a lot of folks said around there, was to lie people out of trouble.  So I did not have a very high opinion, generally, of lawyers.  But at any rate, the thing that really started me on the road to changing my idea about lawyers was an experience I had while I was in service. This lawyer spent his free time teaching prisoners.  These were military people who were in the stockade who couldn&#x27;t read and write.  He spent his free time teaching them to read, teaching them to write.  This just sort of shocked me.  Here this guy is, this was in Japan and of course on the weekend, all the rest of us were going out having fun, and this guy was spending his free time doing this.  That sort of changed my idea a little bit. After that, of course, I met other lawyers and talked with others and I began to read more about them and that was when I read about a lot of the things lawyers were doing and the good things they were doing.  I talked with, among others, Kenneth Lee in Greensboro who had come from Hamlet which was a little town about 15 miles from Ellerbe, who had done a lot of things in the civil rights area.  He had done a lot of things to help people and had done some economic things in terms of improving the lives 7 of people.  He had a lot to do with me deciding I wanted to try law and, probably more importantly from a standpoint of Kenneth, was the fact that I had been discouraged by some others on going to law school because of my background.  They said, &quot;Well, suppose you go to law school, what are you going to do when you get out? Do you have anyone in your family who is in business or anything?&quot; I said, &quot; No.&quot;  &quot;Anybody in your family who is in law?&quot;  I said, &quot;No, nothing like that.&quot;  &quot;Anybody in any governmental position? Anybody in any field that could help you get started in the practice of law?&quot;  Of course, the answer to all of these things was no.  When I talked to Kenneth Lee, he said, &quot;Don&#x27;t pay attention to that stuff.  You go down and you do well and you&#x27;ll be all right.&quot; And of course that&#x27;s what I did and it was all right.  All of those things had a lot to do with my deciding to go into law. AB:  What made you decide to go to UNC for law school? HF:  Several things.  First all, by this time I was very conscious of the fact that we still had largely separate black and white institutions.  In talking with other lawyers and people -I found out first of all that a substantial number of the judges, legislators, and people who ran the state were graduates of Carolina Law School.  So I said, &quot;Well, maybe that&#x27;s where I need to go.&quot; That, together with the fact that I could go there cheaper than I could to one of the private schools, of course. At that time, no black had started at Carolina and completed the three year course and graduated.  All of the others had either started and not finished or had transferred from North Carolina Central which prior to that time had been the school for blacks--the law school for blacks in North Carolina.  So I said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll try.&quot;  I applied and was accepted and went on to law school. AB:  What was it like? You were the only black in your law school class, weren&#x27;t you? HF:  Yes, yes.  That was not a major problem for me.  It would have been probably if I had been single.  But I was married and by this time my interest really was solely in law and my 8 social life was back in Greensboro; so I was interested in just going to school and getting my work and that type of thing. There was no real problem other than trying to get those tough cases and briefing those and that type of thing.  So I thought that I was treated fairly by the instructors and things of that nature. AB: Did you live in Chapel Hill at that time or were you commuting from Greensboro? HF:  I commuted completely the first year.  There were two other persons from Greensboro, and the three of us generally rode back and forth every day. The second year I--I&#x27;m not sure, either the second or third year, I got a room in the dormitory down there and I would stay down a couple of nights a week or something of that nature.  Near the end of my third year, my wife was pregnant; so we found an apartment in Chapel Hill and she moved down with me.  For the last semester, I guess, I lived in Chapel Hill and she was there with me. AB:  From what I have read, you were involved in the NAACP pretty early. HF:  Well, yes, a little bit when I was in high school.  We had a little NAACP chapter and I sold memberships in the NAACP and things of that nature.  Incidentally, this is an interesting thing I observed at that time.  Contrary to the situation today, in the eyes of a lot of people the NAACP was looked at a very radical organization. Black teachers who were members, and only a few of them were members, kept that a secret.  They would not dare let the school board, for example, or people generally in the community know that they were members of the NAACP because they were afraid they would be fired for that reason.  I recall incidentally my English teacher again, Mrs. Easterling, who was elected an officer in the NCTA which was the North Carolina Teachers&#x27; Association and that was the black teachers.  In other words, they had two separate organizations then for teachers. You had the North--I&#x27;ve forgotten the name of the white group, but the white group had a teachers&#x27; association and the black 9 group had one.  At any rate, there was something in the paper about it.  Someone, some official contacted her wanting to know why she was an officer in the NAACP.  She had to explain to them that this was not the NAACP.  This was the NCTA which was the teachers&#x27; association and not that terrible radical National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At any rate, getting back to my own involvement.  From that then at A&amp;T we organized.  I help organize an NAACP chapter, which again was not very active and not radical at all by most terms.  We were concerned about racial things, but not, at that point, we were not sitting in or anything of that nature.  Later on I became a life member and generally tried to work with the organization. But I&#x27;ve--I&#x27;m trying to think, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, since I left college I don&#x27;t think I ever been an officer myself. AB:  So you weren&#x27;t active during law school? HF:  No. HF:  Let me back up if I might.  I think this is of some significance.  One of the questions that I was asked about when I was being considered for my character and so forth for the practice of law, that is really to get my license, one of the questions they asked about was my involvement with the NAACP, which I thought was a little unfair, frankly.  I didn&#x27;t think that had anything to do with it. But that was one of the questions along with some others that I thought were quite inappropriate.  Our bar association thing, I understand now, is a lot better and you don&#x27;t have the kind of problems that we had in those days. AB:  What other questions did you find problematic? HF:  I don&#x27;t want to try to repeat them because I don&#x27;t remember the exact questions.  But I was interviewed at the Bar office and the person who interviewed me is dead now, so I don&#x27;t want t&#x27;o get into all of that.  A lot of lawyers who took the bar at that time would understand because there weren&#x27;t just blacks, even though blacks I think had a harder time.  There were some of the other students who had a very difficult time with some of the 10 questions that were asked and the manner in which they were treated who were applying to take the North Carolina Bar examination.  I think all of that is behind us now.  I think we have got --in fact I&#x27;m the liasion from the court to the Board of Law Examiners.  So I have watched real closely over the years the improvements that have come in that area.  That is an area that we have had a lot of substantial improvement. AB:  Prior to going to law school, you mentioned you were in the Air Force in Japan and Korea. Was there anything from that experience, other than what you mentioned about the lawyer you observed, that particularly stands out in your mind? HF: Well, I could go back.  First of all at A&amp;T, as I recall, all of the able-bodied men had to be in the Army ROTC. They had to take the basic Army ROTC.  And then while I was there, they organized the first Air Force ROTC chapter.  I did not apply for the officers&#x27; candidate portion.  So later on all of my best friends were in the Air Force ROTC, so I wanted to get in too.  In order to do so, you had to double up in terms of the courses in order to be able to graduate.  To make a long story short, I did that and I recall one thing in particular -- that the idea of taking the advanced ROTC was to get a commission as an officer upon your graduation.  In those days, 21 was sort of the magic --in other words, you were not an adult in North Carolina until you were 21 years of age.  Well, I graduated at age 20 and the big question was whether I was going to be able to get my commission or whether they were going to hold it back until I was 21.  So I got my commission at age 20 and I don&#x27;t know - - to this day I have never asked any questions because I didn&#x27;t want to stir up anything about it, but it came through all right.  I think one of the things I know happened, during the summer while I was at A&amp;T and in ROTC, we went to camp. At the camps the black and white were together, from the black schools, from the white schools, everybody went to camp together.  One of the questions I had in mind because at that time I had gone to school only with blacks, both in high school and at A&amp;T because 11 A&amp;T was black and Carolina, for example, was white and that type of thing.  I just wondered how we would do in terms of the academic material and so forth with them. And I found out that we did as well and sometimes better.  So I began to realize what I didn&#x27;t know and had hoped to be true was that blacks and whites could compete and that race really would not make any difference in terms of the academic ability and things of that nature. Where was I? AB: We were talking about the Air Force. HF:  Oh yeah, yeah.  The same thing carried through when I went into service.  I got my commission and later on went into service. As a practical matter again, let me tell you something else that might serve of interest to students who graduate and have difficulty finding work. When I graduated from A&amp;T with highest honor and all kinds of various honors and things of that nature, including the commission in the Air Force, I was not called for active duty.  So I had a period of time when I had nothing to do, so I tried to get some work around Greensboro.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything.  There was nothing around Ellerbe of any significance, so I went to New York looking for a job.  And, it was just like a broken record, when I would finish the interview, &quot;We don&#x27;t have anything right now, but if we do we will call you.&quot; And I must have heard that a hundred times because I just applied for job after job after job.  And the other thing that I heard over and over again, &quot;Well, we want someone with two years&#x27; experience.&quot; And the question in my mind always was, &quot;How is anybody ever going to get any experience if everybody requires two years of experience.&quot;  So I ended up taking a common laborer job at Armour and Company, which was called, the company was called, the one in New York at this point where I was working, was called New York Butchers.  And that&#x27;s where I worked until I went into the service. Made good money and built up my muscles very well.  And learned a lot about people on the job.  One of the things that I found different on our working, growing up, for some reason or other, maybe my experience was unusual, but we 12 sort of talked civilly to each other. And on that job I found that I thought the people were going to fight on a daily basis. Some of the things that they said to each other, and, somehow it seemed to me that instead of trying to work together to get the job done, everybody was concerned with what my job is, is that in my job description, and that type of thing. And I was not very impressed with a lot of that, during that period of time. But any rate, I was glad to, when I got my orders to go on active duty and get away from it. AB:  What type of manual labor were you doing? HF:  It involved several different things, but basically this was a plant where they killed the cows, pigs, and sheep as I recall.  It was a slaughterhouse.  And so I ended up handling those animals after they were killed, and putting them on racks and moving them from one place to the other and even doing some cutting and things of that nature.  Got pretty good at it before I left. AB: What did you think of it, was this your first real living experience up north? HF: Yes, I had been to New York two or three times before, but this was the first job I had had away. And, well, it was an interesting experience. AB:  I notice you didn&#x27;t stay up north. HF:  Well, I always said, at that time, if I could get a job making $100,000 a year, I might consider living in New York.  I would change that now, it would have to be $300,000.  But I did learn some things.  I got to the place I could ride the subway. I could get on the subway, the A train. And late at night go to sleep, wake up just as I arrived at 125th Street station. So I thought I had really learned.  I also learned how to stand up on the subway and read the newspaper while I was riding along.  And one other thing, incidentally, I did go back to New York, to Brooklyn actually, after I came out of service, while I was waiting to go to law school.  And I lived in the Bedford Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn and I had a 1951 Chevrolet 13 automobile, which I parked out in front of the house each night and I did not lock the doors. AB:  Times have changed. HF:  So my opinion changed just a little bit.  I was in a much better neighborhood at that time and it was not bad at all. We did not have the crime at that point that they have now. AB: Going back to your college experience at A &amp; T. What kind of activities were you involved in? HF:  Everything.  [laughter]  I was a very active person.  I was in a lot of different organizations.  One of them was the Richard B. Harrison Players.  Richard B. Harrison was an actor on Broadway, played the role of the Lord in The Lord and Green Pastures. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve heard of that.  But any rate, he taught at A &amp; T for a while, so the Richard B. Harrison players was named after him.  I had the leading role.  I played Leo in The Little Foxes by Lillian Hellman I believe.  I played in the Welsh boy in The Corn is Green by Maynard, I believe he wrote that.  And then I also participated in some shorter plays over at Bennett College which was across the street. And in one I recall in particular, I don&#x27;t even recall the name of it, I was supposed to smoke a cigar in this play. And so for about three weeks before that, I practiced smoking a cigar because the first one I smoked didn&#x27;t go very well with me.  But any rate, I learned to smoke cigars during that particular time and I thought did very well in the play.  But addition to that, one of the things that I enjoyed most was the Student Legislative Assembly.  And I came to Raleigh for the Student Legislative Assembly. At that time we actually met in the House and Senate Chambers. And during the second time that I came, I was elected Speaker Pro Tern of the House. And I was presiding one day and there was a real rivalry between State and Carolina, even then, among the students, in the student legislative assembly.  And, they got into, the two got into just a big argument about something, and students then from everywhere started jumping up and trying to get attention and one would say this one&#x27;s out of order and everything.  I at first 14 was, &quot;The Chair recognizes the gentlemen from here, the lady from there.&quot; Finally I just took the gavel and I said, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s out of order but me.&quot;  [laughter]  Any rate, that sort of quietened things down, and everything, and we finally got control again.  But it was a great experience and I still have a picture of me presiding over the House at that time. And since then, of course, later on as you know I got elected to the House. AB:  Was it through the student assembly that you met your wife? HF: No, that&#x27;s an interesting story. We had an organization known as Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society which was primarily in black colleges and universities.  And I was the dean of pledges. We sent letters to freshmen who had averages, academic averages above some certain level. And so one of the persons that I sent one to was E. Shirley Taylor.  And I think that&#x27;s the way I first met her.  But in terms of actually becoming boyfriend/girlfriend, that occurred later.  I did not have a steady girlfriend at that time.  But there was a young lady that I liked. And so I had invited her to come to something, some party that we were having, a dance or something. And she kept putting me off.  And after about the third time, she said she hadn&#x27;t decided whether she was going home that weekend or something. And I said the next decent lady I see walking past I&#x27;m going to ask her to go to this dance with me.  And the next one I saw was Shirley.  And so I asked her if she would go to the dance with me.  She put me off. Any rate, we were in the same class, incidentally, so she had figured she would see me at the class, at the next class meeting, and she had planned all of the time to go, but she wasn&#x27;t going to give me an immediate answer. Any rate, it turned out that I didn&#x27;t go to the class the next day. And so I think she got real upset because she really wanted to go.  But to make a long story short she finally, she finally got word to me that she would go.  And it&#x27;s very interesting, at that dance, just prior to that, I had gone to some dances with some other ladies, who, for some reason or other, would not leave 15 me, you understand.  Every dance, they would either catch hold of me or stay with me and I didn&#x27;t like that.  I liked to kind of be free at that time.  And Shirley - - if I wanted to dance she danced, if I didn&#x27;t, she went on with somebody else.  And I liked that.  And so one thing led to another, and we became fairly close before I left A&amp;T.  Then after I left and went into service she wrote me every day that I was in Japan. TAPE 1 - SIDE B HF:  She wrote a letter every day. And she had some beautiful pink stationery and blue stationery.  And I think it had a little scent to it.  But I looked forward to, I could tell when the mail came, I could spot her letters among the mail anytime.  I kind of liked that. AB:  I hear you were quite a poet.  Did you ever write her love letters and poems? HF:  Not very much.  I may have written one or two poems, or something of that nature.  Some of my letters may have been just a tiny bit romantic, but not too much.  The thing of poetry really came later.  It&#x27;s simple poetry.  Most of it relates to things that are happening right at the moment.  I really got started I think this way.  Curry School, Curry High School in Greensboro had been operated by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  Before that it was Women&#x27;s College.  And the school was closing.  This was going to be the last high school graduation from this school.  And they asked me to do the commencement address. And, as the time got closer and closer, I just had difficulty trying to prepare a speech for that commencement.  I just said, what in the world do I say to these seniors who are graduating.  They know this is the last graduating class.  Finally that afternoon I picked up a copy of the graduation program.  I said, let me write a little poem to sort of get started with.  I started writing it and using the names of the students of the potential graduates.  And the more I wrote, the more came to me.  And, by the time I had finished, I 16 had included every student&#x27;s name in that poem in some way.  I read that thing that night and it just went over extremely well. And a lot of it was true, some of the things that I said about the particular students. Well, in fact I knew some of them.  But others I didn&#x27;t know but I just sort of guessed something, and something to make it rhyme, really. And I enjoyed giving it and they enjoyed it and in fact they asked me for it and later I typed it up.  It was hand written for that night.  Later I got it typed up, so all of them could have a copy of it.  But after that I started on a lot of speaking engagements, either for myself or attending events for others. During the course of the program I would get bored.  So I got in the habit of writing poetry about the program itself.  And that carried over, and then the same thing happened in the legislature.  We would be debating a bill and sometimes it just got boring, so I started writing something about that and so I just got in the habit of doing it.  So it&#x27;s a lot.of fun, I enjoy it. AB: After you got out of law school, you started practicing in Greensboro, is that right? HF:  Yes. AB:  I have a picture of you when you started your law practice.  It&#x27;s from an article announcing the opening of your law office. HF:  Oh, yes.  Now where did you find that? This is a picture of me opening my law office in Greensboro for the general practice of law.  Sworn in before Judge L. Richardson Preyer. At that time he was a Superior Court Judge.  Later he became a federal judge and when I was appointed assistant United States Attorney, he was the person who administered the oath of office to me. And I felt real great about that, you know he was the same person who administered the oath to me as a lawyer to practice law, and then the same one who administered the oath for that purpose. AB:  During your law practice, do any cases stand out in your memory? 17 HF:  Well, one of the more trying ones, was the time that I represented a group of workers at UNC-G.  What had happened was that the cafeteria workers went on strike at the university and they wanted higher pay and better working conditions and things of that nature.  But they were not employed by the university. It was a private concern that handled it. And the student government at UNC-G got interested in it and wanted to help the cafeteria workers.  And they tried to get, I don&#x27;t know how many lawyers they tried to get, and they couldn&#x27;t get a lawyer to handle it, of course they didn&#x27;t have very much money for one thing.  And it was a very sensitive type of thing, too, because you would be representing people who were trying to form a union and that type of thing.  But, any rate, to make a long story short, I recall that the president of the student government of UNC-G, and somebody else came to my office and practically begged me to take the case.  They said, &quot;All we have is $500.&quot;  They said, &quot;But we&#x27;ll pay that and we wish you would do it, and they said something like, &quot;You&#x27;re our last hope.&quot;  I am sort of sensitive to things like that, at least I used to be, I&#x27;m trying to get away from it.  So any rate, I said I&#x27;d see what I can do. But the most interesting thing about it was, they had a negotiating committee that would meet with the lawyer and someone from the company that handled the food service. And so every time the lawyer for the company would make a suggestion he could look at the faces of the members of the negotiating committee and tell whether they agreed or disagreed with it. And so I found that my being there wasn&#x27;t much help one way or the other because it was just a poor negotiating situation and so I finally told them, it doesn&#x27;t make sense, let&#x27;s find something else, and I won&#x27;t go into all the details, but we settled it because the persons from the university got involved. When we first started, the people at the university said they had nothing to do with it. It was a private matter between the cafeteria workers and the company, but we finally convinced them that the university was involved.  And once the university got involved we worked it out. 18 They got a fairly decent settlement and things were worked out. But, I see some of those people today and they thank me for doing that.  So that was a very helpful one. Without going into a lot of details, another thing that I got a lot of satisfaction out of, down at Salisbury, North Carolina, a redevelopment project was being conducted down there. That involved condemning a lot of homes and then removing them and making, eventually, an improved area from the standpoint of buildings and things of that nature. And this particular woman owned her own home and she decided she wasn&#x27;t going to move. And they sent the people out there from the Highway Department or something and she got a shotgun and ordered them off the property.  Any rate, to make a long story short again, her minister called me and asked me if I would represent her.   She was not satisfied with the representation she was getting down there.  And I went down and decided to represent her and we eventually got something worked out on it. As a result of that, I ended up representing a lot of people whose land, whose houses, were being taken, frankly without getting fair compensation for their property, that&#x27;s really what it amounted to.  And we were able to get a better deal for all of them, so I was well satisfied with that. I could go on and on.  Let me give you one more, then I&#x27;ll quit.  There was a federal program which allowed non-profit organizations to form a corporation and build housing for low and moderate income people. And so I worked, first of all, with one of the churches there in Greensboro who was trying to get some land for that purpose. And the people who were handling it for the government who owned the land at that particular point really gave them bad advice. After I checked out the law, we found a way to get the property and then eventually form the corporation and get the money and then build that housing and then later on working with the Low Income Housing Development Corporation out of Durham.  I worked with a lot of other organizations.  Mostly churches, incidentally, who would form these corporations and 19 build houses and the idea was not just to build a house and get somebody in it, but to teach the people how to take care of the houses and things of that nature.  And we did that in several cities in North Carolina:  Greensboro, one here in Raleigh, incidentally, and in Charlotte, and Salisbury, one or two other places like that.  I found that very, very enjoyable, very rewarding. AB: From that story and from some other things you have mentioned, do you see as part of a lawyer&#x27;s role going beyond just the legal aspects of his client&#x27;s case? HF:  Well, yes.  I think, and this is a little old-fashioned, I suppose, but I think of a lawyer as being a person who is performing a service and that your primary interest ought to be in performing a service for someone, realizing that you need to paid for your work, but that you&#x27;re working not just for the pay, you&#x27;re working because you want to perform a service. And whether that&#x27;s helping someone who needs to have a will drawn or handling their estate or advising them about various things or whether it&#x27;s representing a big corporation, or whatever it is, that the idea is service.  Of course, the servant is worthy of his hire.  But that the emphasis ought to be placed on service, then the money is another thing.  Incidentally, along that line, I recall this elderly woman who was getting ready to go to the hospital and she wanted a will drawn before she went to the hospital. And the undertaker, believe it or not who was her friend, and incidentally undertakers are friends of a lot of people, they advise a lot of people.  Some of them actually practice law...they shouldn&#x27;t be doing it, but some of them do. But anyway, he called me and told me that this lady wanted a will, said she had $17, that&#x27;s all she could afford, but he called and asked me if I would do it for her.   I told him, yeah, I&#x27;d be glad to do it.  So she came in and I got all the information and everything and told her to come back in a couple of hours and I would have the will for her. And she came back and she was a lady who made a living as a housekeeper, and so she 20 brought the lady for whom she worked with her, along with another neighbor to my office, because she wanted them to be witnesses to her will. And we did. And she went into the hospital, and she lived after the operation, thank goodness.  That lady sent business to me as long as I practiced law.  People were always coming to me saying that this lady was the one who sent me. And incidentally later, about two or three years ago, she was honored by Channel 2 [WFMY], the TV station in Greensboro, as a person who cares for the community.  She was the kind of person who did a lot of work in the community, helping people and so forth, so she was one of the people who was honored by them.  I was there and she reminded me of that at that time. Incidentally, that was another enjoyable part of my practice -- advising people concerning their estates and regarding planning for the future and doing wills and estate planning and things of that nature.  I had several people who sort of came to me on a regular basis I think not so much for legal advice, but for practical advice.  Elderly people whose children or grandchildren were not doing as they thought they should, and they were trying to decide whether to name them in their will, or whether to give the money to charity or something, and what they could do to work with them and to help them and that type of thing.  I probably spent more time than I should dealing with things of that nature.  I almost got out of doing regular domestic legal work because I found out that I was not very good at that because people would come to me for advice and then I would give them the advice and they would go and do exactly the opposite of what I told them to do. And then blame me because it didn&#x27;t work.  I found that a bit...disillusioning, I guess would be a good word.  So I tried to get away from a lot of the domestic law and let somebody else handle that. AB:  Well, that&#x27;s kind of common in family law matters sometimes.  What made you decide to go into politics? HF:  Well, we in Greensboro we had run a black candidate on a couple of occasions for the House and been unable to get a 21 black elected and as a matter of fact had blacks running from Winston-Salem and some other places and at that time there had been no black in the legislature in this century.  I just said it&#x27;s time for somebody to do it and I believe I can do it. And so I talked with a lot of people and everything and was encouraged, and ran, and lost. Very interesting, at that time Guilford County had six representatives and you ran at large so that the six top candidates won and anybody below that lost.  I don&#x27;t remember how many we had, let&#x27;s see there were nine people running.  I came in seventh, so I lost.  But the sixth person was James Exum, who is now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. And I think that&#x27;s very interesting.  So I told him the other day that he was the person who beat me in the election.  But any rate, I lost that time, and the next time that I ran I won fairly handily.  But I thought I could make a difference, and so I ran and finally won and went down and tried to make a difference. AB:  Who were some of your supporters back then who encouraged you to run? HF:  I could name a hundred.  I remember one fellow, a dentist there, Dr. B.W. Barnes, who said well, if you run I&#x27;ll raise the money for you.  And he did.  Then I had other people who said they would be glad to do work for me and things of that nature and they did.  And I remember after I lost, there were several people who came to me and said, &quot;We want you to run again and we&#x27;re going to help you win the next time.&quot; Very interesting thing.  Dave Morehead, who was the executive director of the YMCA and friend of a lot of people in Greensboro, including a lot of the so-called power structure of Greensboro, talked with, and I think this is all right to tell, with a fellow named Ed Zane, who was the treasurer as I recall, of Burlington Industries. Very fine gentleman and very active in the community and everything. And he said, &quot;Get a complete resume and get it to me.  And I&#x27;m going to make copies of it and distribute them among a group of my friends.&quot;  And I got a detailed list, that was my first 22 detailed biographical sketch, from the things you&#x27;ve seen, being born in Ellerbe, and right on up.  And Dave Morehead gave that to him and he distributed it and I know that he did because I found out later from other people, that that&#x27;s how they learned about me.  I recall by this time that I had another treasurer because Dr. Barnes was getting a little old and so forth, and this treasurer when my campaign started and he told me, he said, &quot;You&#x27;re going to win this time,&quot; and I said, &quot;How do you know?&quot; He said, &quot;I can tell by the checks that are coming in.&quot; And there were a lot of checks that came in from a lot of people who had not contributed before,  and he said that means you&#x27;re going to win.  And he was right.  I did.  I won.  One of the things that I got criticized for, not me as much as some of the people who were espousing it, they said that we had bloc voting by blacks for me.  And they were saying, by bloc voting, in other words, even though you could vote for six, that a lot of black precincts, they just voted for me, and the intent of course was to be sure that I got elected. And so I was asked about that, and I said well, I understand that because if I had depended on certain of the silk stocking precincts, I would have still lost because in several of those precincts I still came in seventh or eighth place, which meant I would have lost, so the bloc voting helped me to get elected. And I said once we get blacks in the legislature commensurate with the population, then we can stop bloc voting, and just vote basically on qualifications on the total rather than on that particular thing.  But that didn&#x27;t end the controversy, of course, it continued. AB: Did your campaign encourage bloc voting among the black population? Or did the black voters take it upon themselves? HF:  Well, a lot of the people who were active in my campaign did it.  I didn&#x27;t go out and say that.  But I didn&#x27;t go out and preach against it either, because at that time that was the only way to get elected. What had to happen was that I had to get enough votes in the black precincts to offset the fact that I lost in so many of the others.  And so you put those 23 together, I came in rather high.  Now, by the time before I left the legislature, that was unnecessary because then I was also winning in a lot of those precincts.  And I&#x27;m a great believer that if you&#x27;ve got a bad situation, you&#x27;ve got to do drastic things to change that situation.  Hopefully, those things are temporary, you see, so that once you get over that bad situation, then you can go back to normalcy, I guess would be a good term. But I believe you have to do what needs to be done to get the job done.  So I defended bloc voting in that situation. And not only with me, but with others where we were trying to get blacks elected into various positions. AB: Did you see that as a major goal --to elect black people in North Carolina? HF:  Yes. Very definitely.  You see because up until a few years before then, you had very few blacks in any elected office. Town councils and everything else.  You would have occasionally one and in many cases, none at all, and so you had to take drastic methods to try to get that done. AB:  So as the first black elected to the state legislature, what was your main priority? HF: Well, my first thing was to get through that amendment to abolish the literacy test as a requirement for voting and I got that through.  I found myself, though, spending a great deal of time going through bills for what I considered bad things in bills that came up in the legislator and a lot of those were local bills.  I also found myself talking with blacks from all over the state of North Carolina.  They would come from all over the state to Raleigh to see me to try to get me to either put in a bill for them, or try to get me to stop a bill, and so I spent a great deal of my time trying to convince them that what they should do is deal with their own legislators.  But there was no dialogue between a lot of blacks then and their representatives in the legislature.  Sometimes I would take it to the delegation. Somebody would come up and I would take them and go to that legislator and take them with me and say that this was so and so 24 from your district, and they have got a little problem here with this bill, and I told them you would be glad to talk with them. And, of course, they were.  [broad smile] AB:  Playing liaison once again. HF:  Yes, yes.  But I found that to be very effective and it wasn&#x27;t long before a lot of them began to have that dialogue with their representatives, which is what they should have had all of the time. AB:  Do you remember any confrontations occurring early in your years with the legislature regarding any racial issues that came to the floor? HF:  Well, when I was presenting my bill to abolish the literacy test, in talking about it and giving the history and so forth, one of the legislators asked for the floor and he said that this amendment had nothing to do with race -- nothing whatsoever to do with race.  When he finished, I explained on the floor of the House very clearly that it did have a whole lot to do with race, that that really was the primary reason for it being there in the first place and gave my own personal example to prove it.  That, incidentially, helped to get the bill passed. Another thing that happened that was -- I&#x27;m not sure it was racial -- but it was when I was elected to the Senate.  Offices are assigned based on seniority and at that time the rules of the Senate required that seniority be based on service in the General Assembly, which meant that a person who had 10 years in the House and 2 years in the Senate had 12 years&#x27; seniority and offices were assigned on that basis.  So based on my seniority, I was something like -- let&#x27;s just say, 7th in seniority in the General Assembly, so I should have gotten 7th pick on the offices.  But the person in charged just ignored me and didn&#x27;t make an assignment, which meant that that left me with just a regular office like people with no seniority.  When I complained about it, two or three members came to me and said all you are going to do is stir up problems and all like that and so forth.  And I said that I understand that, but I just want to be sure that we 25 uphold the rules of the legislature and the rules of the Senate. Under the rules I am entitled to pick number 7 or whatever the number was.  The chairman came in and I picked the one that I got, but it meant that the Senator who had moved in had to move out.  There was some criticism about that, but it didn&#x27;t bother me because I knew I was right and then, of course, others came and told me that I was right to insist on it and that type of thing.  I was generally respected -- for whatever reason, you know, [laughter] -- when I went there and a lot of the legislators went out of their way to try to be helpful and everything and I appreciate that.  I developed some very long-term friendships from that legislative service.  Incidentally, one of the persons who is in the legislature with me was Willis Whichard, who is now on the court with me.  He left the legislature before I did and he was a very fine legislator. AB:  Were there other instances where you confronted the &quot;don&#x27;t rock the boat&quot; mentality when bringing racial issues to the forefront? HF:  Yes, this had to do with the Appropriations Committee. At that time the money that was appropriated by the legislature to the various child caring institutions depended not on any formula or anything of that nature but just whatever, I guess whoever had the most influence would get that amount for that particular institution.  It included institutions which discriminated on the basis of race.  I asked a lot of questions. That was one of the things that I did in the legislature.  I asked more questions I guess than anybody else because a lot of things I really didn&#x27;t know.  I was always asking questions and probing.  I found out a lot of things by doing that.  At any rate, I was made chairman of a subcommittee to look into the way those funds were handled. My subcommittee visited several of the institutions and then we came back and developed a formula really based on need.  Based on that some of them at least that had not been getting very much money began to get a little bit more.  We had to be very careful with that because one of the most needy 26 was the Orphanage up in Oxford and we had two.  One was Central Orphanage where black orphans were and the other one was Oxford Orphanage where white orphans were.  The white orphanage was getting much more money than the black one even though the need was much greater. We finally got that worked out, and that worked out fairly well.  I don&#x27;t know what they are doing now, how that works.  Another that I sort of gave in on - - we were appropriating money for the Home for Confederate Widows, I believe, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the exact name -- Daughters of the American Revolution and I think it was the Confederate Home for Women.  I sort of questioned a very large expenditure for that and they told me not to rock the boat and I said okay, all right. Maybe that&#x27;s not worth making a big issue out of, you know.  I tried--my thing was to try and concentrate on the big issues and the long haul to get the job done, so it worked pretty well. AB:  During the sit-ins, what were you up to? HF:  I was practicing law at the time the sit-ins started. Then shortly after that, I went into the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office. Let me back up -- during the sit-ins, I was not involved in it, though some of my friends declared I started it; but really --it really caught me as a surprise.  One of the persons who was in law school with me said that I had said that&#x27;s what ought to be done back then, you know. As I said, I had nothing really to do with it.  I was supportive, but I was not directly involved. Then later in the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office when we had another group of sit-ins, it got very tense because, here again, I was the only black in the office. We made it through all right.  I ended up marching one night. What happened was that there was an article in the paper, in The Greensboro Daily News in effect saying that the so-called responsible black citizens of the community were not behind this thing.  These were nothing but the students and the radicals and that type of thing.  So a group of responsible citizens, including me, got on the phone and we called and got a bunch of people.  We got school teachers, principals, professors from A&amp;T, doctors in the community, and 27 everything.  So that night we had a meeting, I forgot what we even called the meetings in those days but any rate, we had a silent march downtown.  I was out there marching with all the rest of them.  That was really my only - - I may have marched twice, but that&#x27;s the only one I remember because I was Viot a marching type and I&#x27;m not now.  I&#x27;d rather do mine another way. Among other things, I don&#x27;t know what I would do if somebody spit in my face or something.  I think I would -- I don&#x27;t know if I could handle that, if you understand. AB:  I understand.  You also taught at N.C. Central. What classes did you teach there? HF:  What didn&#x27;t I teach!  [laughter] I was there for two years.  I taught constitutional law, criminal law, future interests, civil procedure.  I had a different subject each time, and it was probably that I was new on the faculty.  I think that I taught what nobody else wanted to teach, but I learned a lot. The best way to learn something is to try to teach it.  Take it from me.  I learned things about -- future interests.  I took future interests in law school.  I think I made a B out of it, but I still didn&#x27;t understand it.  When time came to try to teach it to somebody else, I had to understand it, and so I spent hours and hours and hours and hours reading and drawing diagrams and trying to understand future interests.  I think I finally got to the place I understood it.  So it was a good experience for me. I taught for two years. When I got ready to run for office, one of my classes paid my filing fee.  Yeah, back then it was $17.50. So they got together their dollars and fifty cents and quarters and things and paid my filing fee.  So the first time I ran, my filing fee was paid by my students. AB: Did you feel any pressure to be a role model for your students? HF:  That didn&#x27;t bother me.  What I tried to do was, in addition to trying to get them to not use &quot;canned briefs&quot; and to actually brief the cases and to actually talk about them and be able to deal with them and be able to write and things of that 28 nature, was to try and convince them that the important thing is to start at the beginning of the year and keep up rather than trying to catch up later on.  One of the problems and I won&#x27;t go into all the details, but one of the problems with a lot of the students there at that point was that they were working.  So you had students who were driving cabs at night and trying to go to school in the daytime.  It made it very difficult trying to keep up with all of the work that you have to do in law school.  That was a real problem.  I spent a lot of time with the students and tried to be of help where I could.  It was not an easy task.  Two things and I feel real good about this.  Two of my students are now judges, there may be some others.  But one of them is Cliff Johnson, who is on the Court of Appeals.  I remember in constitutional law that I told him that I thought he could do better than he was doing, and he did better.  The other one is - -his name escapes me now -- but he is a presiding judge in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He&#x27;s white, incidentally.  We did have white and black students at Central at that time, and they do now, of course, you know.  I spoke at the National Bar Association.  They had a luncheon honoring a bunch of lawyers out there and I was the speaker.  So while I was sitting there waiting for my speech, this guy walks in and comes up and says, &quot;Well, you won&#x27;t remember me, but I took constitutional law under you and I made a B and I remember the question that I missed.&quot; Any rate, he is chief of a group of municipal courts in Indiana. So that is a good feeling. AB:  Did your students consider you to be a stickler? HF:  Well, they said I was.  I thought I was fairly lenient. I tried to get people to say exactly what they mean. A lot of times, all of us don&#x27;t say exactly what we mean.  In that sense, I am a stickler. AB:  In 1971, you organized the Greensboro National Bank. Could you tell us a little bit about this business venture? HF:  Oh, yes.  Well, let me give you my experience again. Again, growing up in Ellerbe and then going to Greensboro and 29 being around in North Carolina and so forth.  The only way that I know how to explain this is that every building I went into, I saw white people.  The blacks I saw were either operating elevators.  You don&#x27;t do that know, but we used to have somebody that actually operated the elevators.  The only blacks I saw were people who were operating the elevators or sweeping the floors or coming in to buy something if it was a regular store or something like that.  Banks, you walked in the banks, all the tellers were white, the officers were white.  You go into the insurance company, this was the situation.  One day I went into North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company building in Durham and I saw all of these black folks in there with suits on and women dressed up and everything and working.  I said, &quot;Boy, this is really something.&quot; Then I went in Mechanics and Farmers Bank and I saw the same thing.  Then I came back to Greensboro and I didn&#x27;t see that.  I didn&#x27;t see any of that. So I said, we have got to do something about that.  So my first thought was a savings and loan association because I thought that would be cheaper. When I say cheaper, I mean, easier to organize.  But Kenneth Lee beat me to that and he organized American Federal Savings and Loan Association.  Then I said the next thing is a bank, so let&#x27;s try a bank.  To give you some idea how much nerve I guess I had -- first of all, I didn&#x27;t have any money and everybody told me that if you&#x27;re going to organize a bank you&#x27;ve got to have some money.  I said, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll get some money.&quot; So I started talking to people and trying to get some interest in it.  The controller&#x27;s office is in Washington, DC, but the one for the region for North Carolina is in Richmond, Virginia.  So any rate, once I got a group of people, a small group who were interested enough to agree to put up a little money, I went to Richmond.  I caught the bus, went up there, transacted my business; I had to spend one night up there and then caught the bus and came on back. At any rate, they told us we needed $300,000 capital minimum in order to start.  The next time I went back, it was $500,000.  The third time, it was 30 $700,000.  I said, &quot;We better hurry up and get started because at the rate we&#x27;re going, we never will get it.&quot; Any rate, I finally pulled some people together.  I told them that what we needed was 10 people, and I said that everybody has got to have at least $10,000 except me.  The minimum you had to have according to the way we had it set up was $2,500 in order to be an organizer.  I said I would come up with $2,500 somehow.  So I got the other people and I borrowed some money, frankly, for mine and we put the money in an account. We started working on it and after a period of time, we were able to find a person from Richmond, Virginia, who was a vice president of the bank up there --a black person, you know, who was going to come in and run the bank for us.  We did our offering circulars and started distributing the offering circulars.  He called me and told me that he was not going to be able to come because of some things that had occurred at the bank. AB:  Things that had occurred at your bank? HF:  No, at his bank.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what they was, but it wasn&#x27;t too long after that that they made him president of that bank.  Okay.  So we had to start all over again.  We had to tear up those offering circulars, had to find somebody else. TAPE 2, SIDE A HF:  Where were we? AB:  You were just saying that at that point you were determined to get a black person to run the bank. HF:  Yes, any rate, so when I found somebody who was really qualified to do it, he said, &quot;Well, do you have the money to open the bank?&quot; And of course I said no. We can&#x27;t get the money until we know who is going to run the bank, because people are not going to subscribe to stock if they don&#x27;t know who is going to be handling it.  Again, to make another long story short, I talked with Tom Stores, who at that time was heading NCNB, which is now NationsBank.  He told me that there was a retired person from his bank who would, he thought, would be happy to work with 31 us in organizing the bank, who had a lot of great experience and that type of thing, that it would be worth talking to him and so I did.  So I talked with Mr. Witherspoon, that was his name.  He agreed to come in and help us with the bank as really a consultant is what it amounted to, but I think we named him vice president or something, I don&#x27;t remember what title it was and to help train the person who was going to run the bank.  So we finally found a person who was not near ready to run a bank but who at least had a good background and we brought that person in. Any rate, we decided to make me the president of the bank even though I&#x27;m a lawyer and that type of think, but with the idea of training this person to eventually become the president.  So that&#x27;s what we did and Mr. Wheeler who was the president of the bank in Durham, Mechanics and Farmers Bank that I had talked about, agreed to take the person down there for three or six months prior to opening the bank to give him some experience in a small bank because the guy came from Chemical Bank in New York. He did that.  So any &quot;rate, we finally opened with me as president (and working without pay, incidentally) and finally got started. So it was $700,000 that we had to have in order to open the bank, that is in the amount of stock actually paid in.  So the organizers came up with a little over $100,000 and then we got the rest of it from other people who subscribed.  Among the people -- in addition to individuals, three or four of the corporations in Greensboro actually bought some stock, really to help us out.  I thought that it was a good thing that they were willing to do that because it was not, it really was not much of an investment from the standpoint of really making money.  I think when they found out the number of people who had bought $100 worth, $1,000 worth, $500 worth and that type of thing, that it did have some broad support in the black community primarily, that others went along with it and bought some stock.  So we opened it and I served as president for 10 years.  Each year the income of the bank went up just a little bit, not much -- very 32 slow; but it was an increase, it was going in the right direction. And then, of course, since I left they have had some difficulties -- bad loans, the economy, and all of those things; and I haven&#x27;t heard from the last year whether they made money or not, I&#x27;m still waiting to hear.  But that was a real experience and one of the things when we opened, we opened in a trailer.  I remember talking to a lady about putting some money in the bank and she said that she wasn&#x27;t going to put any money in there because the wind might come along and blow that trailer away and when we got a permanent building then she would put some money in that bank, [laughter]  She actually thought we were going to keep all the money, you know, in that trailer.  She didn&#x27;t know that, you know, that it just flows through and that type of thing.  But we had a lot of interesting experiences with that.  That&#x27;s one of the things that I&#x27;m glad that I did. AB:  Do you feel it is very important to have black figures in control of corporations, in control of businesses? HF:  I think it is very important.  Incidentally, we got jobs for a lot of black folk at other banks.  I would talk to a black person who was at another bank and it wasn&#x27;t long before that person got an increase, got a new salary --if not a salary increase, got a new position, and others began to hire more blacks.  I&#x27;m not saying that was the only reason, but that helped a lot of others from that standpoint.  But it&#x27;s really only a trickle, I guess that&#x27;s the sad part about it, that it has an impact, but it is not a big impact.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have really just gave up the practice of law and run the bank just to see how well we could have done in terms of expansion and including so many things and so many people and everything like that.  But you can&#x27;t do everything, so you have to settle for what you have. 33 TAPE 3, SIDE A February 26, 1992 AB:  Justice Frye, I&#x27;d like to talk a little bit about your role as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and that will probably be most of the focus of today&#x27;s interview. HF:  All right. AB:  Can you tell me a little bit about your appointment in 1983? Were you surprised at all? HF:  I was surprised when I received the call and also the fact that the Governor called me one night and discussed the possible appointment with me and told me that he knew that I would have to talk it over with my wife and give it some thought and so forth, but to please call him back before breakfast the next morning, because he didn&#x27;t want the press to get word of it before he actually made the announcement. That didn&#x27;t give me a lot of time to think about it.  Luckily it was the type of thing that I had given some thought to before, so it was a matter then of really saying, do I really want to do this, or can I afford to make a switch at this point in my life to change from a full-time practicing attorney, which is what I was doing at that time, to go on the court? And, of course, there were other things like whether I wanted to make a commitment at least for a period of time to serving as a judge as distinct from being an advocate, because it is a completely different role.  So, any rate, I thought about it.  I talked it over with my wife, also with my sons and decided yes.  So early the next morning I called the governor and told him what my answer was.  I recall that I told him that I would need 6-8 weeks or something like that to try to sort of wind down my law practice and get everything straight. He said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;d like for you to be on the court at its next session which is in February.&quot; At that time I think it was about three weeks away, and we discussed that at some length.  He was sort of insistent on that and so I said, &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll do 34 that.&quot; That was a real problem trying to close down a law practice of 21 years in about three weeks. AB:  What was the reaction in the press to your appointment? HF:  Well, as I recall, the actual first press announcement was either after the appointment or the day of the appointment, I&#x27;ve forgotten which.  So it worked in the sense that there was not a lot of speculation in the paper about it for two or three days as you would have with some.  It made headlines in the local paper in Greensboro.  I don&#x27;t recall seeing any negative press about it.  In other words, everything that I saw, as nearly as I can remember now, was positive in terms of a good appointment and that made me feel, made me feel very good. AB:  What were your greatest assets, at that time, that you thought you brought to the bench? HF:  Well, I had been practicing law for over 20 years.  In fact, for a longer period than that, but active practice for about 21 years.  I had served in the legislature in the House for 12 years, the Senate for 2 years.  I had served on almost every committee in the legislature, and I had been a prosecutor in the federal system, assistant prosecutor -- actually Assistant U.S. Attorney -- and so, I don&#x27;t think there was any question at all about my qualifications for the court.  So, and again, I don&#x27;t recall any negative comments.  I am sure there may have been some and I just didn&#x27;t hear, obviously, [laughter]  As I recall, there was something about the question of politics and of course, he was a Democrat and I was a Democrat.  I had actually served as one of the co-chairs of his re-election campaign and of course that question, somebody raised that.  I don&#x27;t think that hurt. People don&#x27;t usually appoint their enemies to positions.  They appoint people that generally or even if they are not friends, at least they aren&#x27;t on the opposite side of things.  All in all I thought, well, of course you&#x27;re hot .interested in what I thought. Generally I•think most of the people who commented for publication were favorable in terms of the appointment. 35 AB:  Was it difficult for you to make the transition from advocate to a judge? HF:  It was not a big problem.  It was some difficulty.  I had to sort of catch myself a few times to be sure I remembered that I was not an advocate now.  I was the person who had to make a decision.  But it was not a major problem.  It was a major adjustment and along with that adjustment, of course, was the adjustment of not saying everything that I wanted to say publicly about things generally.  So that when a public issue came up, for example, when I was in the legislature, I could give my opinion on it, say what I thought ought to be done and whether I thought what another person was doing was right and what I thought the General Assembly should do, what I thought the governor should do, or what I thought the members of a city council or mayor of a city should do. All of a sudden, I had to be very careful not to comment about things like that because they might eventually come before the court and that was an adjustment and a very significant one. AB:  Often the role of the legislature is to create the law and the role of the judge is to interpret it, but in many cases, the judge&#x27;s role is to fill in the gaps and create case law.  In such cases, do you find yourself tending to be more of a strict constructionist because of your experience as a legislator? HF:  Well, how do I answer that?  If the question is one of what did the legislature intend, of course you have the easy cases where it is very clear.  There are others where it is unclear and in North Carolina we don&#x27;t have legislative history as such in terms of our opinions for the court.  Obviously, some of the things I could remember when I was in the legislature, how I felt about things.  But I also knew that what was placed in a bill did not always accurately reflect a combined, at least understood, will of all of the members who voted for it.  In other words, some people would have one motive for voting for a bill and others would have another motive.  So where the language is clear then you construe it right down the line and that&#x27;s what 36 I tried to do. Where it was unclear, then I tried to, and still do, try to look at what&#x27;s the purpose of it and to the extent that is stated clearly in the legislation to try to follow it. Now there are a lot of things that will come up under a statute that were not anticipated in the sense of the legislature saying now this is what we want to happen in this type of situation. At that time you try to draw on your experiences and the purposes of the legislation and your leanings and that type of thing, I think, in interpreting it.  I&#x27;m not a strict constructionist, I&#x27;m sure in the sense that the term is sometimes used to say, well, going back at the time this was enacted if it was 100 years ago, what did it mean at that time and without considering the impact today.  So in that sense I guess I&#x27;m not a strict constructionist. AB:  Soon after your appointment the following year, you decided to run for election. HF:  Well, I probably made that decision when I took the appointment.  I would not have taken it had I not intended to stay on at least a while.  So, when I came on the court I knew the term would expire the next year and that the only way I could stay on would be to run for re-election.  So, it was just a matter of getting my campaign together and hoping that nobody would file against me. That hope turned out not to come true, of course. AB: Are there any stories from that first year that stand out in your mind, being the rookie on the bench? HF: Well, yes, a lot of things.  The first one is that the junior member of the court gets the honor of being the clerk of the conference or the secretary for the court.  That means that you have to sign all the orders of the court and keep the minutes and things of that nature. That turned out to be a lot more work than, well, than I had thought about to begin with.  I thought I could just come and be a member of the court.  But as soon as I got here I found out that that was the tradition and so I had no choice but to do that.  After I had been on the court for quite 37 some time, I remember speaking to a small group of lawyers and telling them about the fact that the junior judge signs the orders for the court.  This lawyer responded that he was glad that I told him that because the last order he got I had signed it and it went against him and he thought that I should have given his case a little bit more attention or something of that nature.  He thought that I had made the decision to deny his petition. He said he thought he had prepared such a good petition that at least I would have seen that it was a good petition.  So I found out that a lot of, not only lawyers, but others who saw orders signed by me thought that I was making the decision on those particular petitions. Then there was another very interesting thing.  Because the court had several cases that had been argued before I came, when the opinion came down after I was on the bench, there was this line at the end of the opinion saying Justice Frye did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.  Quite often in the write-up in the paper, this would be repeated.  So I had a lady who was a friend of mine, an elderly lady, ask me why they wouldn&#x27;t let me participate in those cases.  She couldn&#x27;t understand, she thought they were discriminating against me in some way by not letting me participate in those cases.  So I thought that was somewhat interesting.  I explained it to her.  I had to explain that to several people, incidentally, that it was just that I wasn&#x27;t there when the case was heard and that was the reason why I did not participate in that particular case. Another thing that was rather interesting.  We among the court at the time we pick our cases for writing sort of go around the table in order of seniority and you pick your cases.  There is sort of a general understanding among those who have been around for some time that unless you&#x27;ve really got a special interest in a case that generally you sort of, the first case that you pick -- you&#x27;ve got four cases you&#x27;ve got to write -- the first one you pick, you sort of pick the easiest thing you can pick.  Well, I hadn&#x27;t thought about that.  I just looked at the 38 more interesting cases.  So my first pickings of. cases were cases that were very tough, but they were interesting, so folks had a lot of fun off that for a while.  So I got to a place that I could pick a little better after I had been on the court for a while or for some time. AB: What were those first cases? HF: Well, I wouldn&#x27;t want to answer that [laughter] because some of the cases would be well known.  I&#x27;d just as soon not get into the names of them; but some of them were very difficult and it took me a long time and a lot of research and a lot of work to get those cases written.  I felt good once I got through with it. AB:  Was there any case you were especially anxious to get your hands on and write the opinion for? HF:  I don&#x27;t know if there was any one opinion or even any one in a particular area.  You would read the briefs and then you would listen to the oral argument and some of them just presented interesting questions or interesting arguments or cases where. they might be a split in the court, but you felt very strongly that this is the way the case ought to go so you wanted to write it and use your language and hope to get the court to go along with you.  So that was sort of what I had in mind.  Off hand, I don&#x27;t know of any one or two cases that I felt particularly strong about that. AB:  Which would you say has been your most influential opinion? HF:  I don&#x27;t know.  I guess I would have to leave that to posterity, I suppose.  More recently I know one that has been referred to quite a bit.  The case Smith v. Nationwide dealing with underinsured motorists&#x27; coverage.  It was sought after quite a bit partly because it overruled some previous cases, a major case from the Court of Appeals and it was an area that dealt with a statute that the legislature has passed which is almost impossible to understand.  Now the legislature has amended it some more and I&#x27;m not sure if it is any clearer overall, the statute I mean, than it was at that time.  In that opinion I 39 tried to simplify the statute as much as I could.  I think some people thought that I did a fairly good job of doing that and so I think some people got the opinion to see at least what this court thought the legislature meant in terms of how it divided up the types of insurance, that is liability insurance and then the uninsured motorist insurance and then underinsured motorist coverage. AB:  From your experience on both sides, in the legislature and on the court, how responsive do you think the legislature is to the court when you make decisions like that that affect statutory law? HF:  When you say responsive to the court, I think that whenever we interpret a statute, depending on the type, for example, something in insurance, well, that&#x27;s a very hot subject and so you have your interests.  You have your insurance industry and you have in that particular case, I suppose, the plaintiff&#x27;s bar and those they represent who they would say is the consuming public, of course.  So then both sides, depending on their interests, would go to the legislature to try to either confirm what we have already done or to change it.  In the case of some of our decisions in that area I don&#x27;t know that there was anything as a result of that case, but another case that another member of the court wrote shortly after that the legislature made some changes in that area.  As to the terms of what the legislature does, though, I think it has a lot to do with their interests, looking at it from the people back home and to some extent, of course, from the lobbyists from both sides. AB:  What do you think are the best attributes for an attorney to possess? And what do you look for in an attorney who is arguing a case in front of you? HF:  One of the things that helps greatly is if the attorney will be thorough in the sense of carefully laying out the facts as established from the record, which may include the transcript of the trial and that type of thing.  Accuracy and thoroughness. And then the second thing is the clarity with which the argument 40 is presented.  Depending, of course, on the subject matter, it&#x27;s necessary a lot of times to give some history.  The historical development of the doctrine, for example, that&#x27;s being talked about including the purpose of the doctrine and how it developed and why it developed, and then why this case ought to continue that development or why this case should be contra to that development.  In other words, it is a matter of thoroughness, preciseness, clarity - - that type of thing is what is very important.  Now, it&#x27;s awfully important also to be honest in the presentation and not overstate the case and obviously not to misrepresent either the facts or the law.  I have to say that on the whole I think that most of the attorneys who appear before us have been fairly good, and you almost never have intentionally, I think, misstating of either the law or the facts.  So I feel fairly good about the bar that practices before the Supreme Court. AB:  I&#x27;ve heard people talk about when opinions come down and there sometimes will be a great deal of discussion of facts that were not raised or case law that was not presented by either side.  How much does the court go back and do their own research beyond the content of the parties&#x27; briefs? HF:  Well, I guess we sort of say that we have no obligation to go beyond what the parties furnish us.  But I think all of us tend to have our clerks and sometimes ourselves go a little beyond what the attorneys present.  And especially if it&#x27;s a difficult question.  If it&#x27;s easy we may just look at the briefs and go ahead and make a decision and write an opinion and let it go.  But if it&#x27;s a very serious question or if we are going to go contra to what may generally be considered the weight of authority or in death cases, for example, we&#x27;re reading transcripts, you know, to see exactly what was said in terms of what the witnesses said or what they didn&#x27;t say.  And you&#x27;ll find cases, opinions where we count the number of times that, for example, bench conferences occurred or something of that nature because we want to be thorough and we want to be right.  And 41 while as I said, on the whole I think that the bar has been good as far as who appears before the court, some of them, especially, are not thorough, and sometimes even those who seem to be thorough will miss something.  So we sort of double check it. AB:  When the members of the bench are in opposition and wish to dissent from the majority, how does that all diplomatically get handled? HF:  Well, I guess the best way to do this is to look at our procedure.  And while we take a tentative vote in conference on the same day that the argument is heard, that tentative vote is not binding.  But whoever gets the case to write has to circulate a copy of that opinion to all of the other justices at least one week prior to the filing date.  Really, one week prior to the conference date for filing opinions.  Then the other person has ordinarily about three days, don&#x27;t hold me to the exact figure, to come up with the dissent.  But we are very good about extending the time for filing a dissent if the person asks us for one.  So quite often the cases are held up in order to give the other person time to write a dissent.  The other thing is,&quot; quite often the person doing a dissent will cause the writer of the opinion to make some changes in it. And on at least three or four occasions since I&#x27;ve been on the court, the dissent has caused us to change and reach a result opposite from that originally taken by the majority of the court.  So, the dissents are very, very valuable things in this court. And, while the language sometimes appears a bit caustic, on the whole, we get along well. AB:  That&#x27;s good.  How long do you get to write the opinion, from the time you choose the case to the period when it gets circulated among the court? HF: Well, we don&#x27;t have any absolute guidelines. We try to get them out within three to six months.  But a lot of the very difficult cases, and some of the death cases, take much longer. We feel generally that it&#x27;s better to be right than to rush an opinion and make a mistake. 42 AB:  Back in the early 70&#x27;s when you were in the Legislature you supported a bill to abolish the death penalty. HF:  Yes. AB:  Do you find that your personal feelings affect your outlook on some of these death cases? HF: Well, that&#x27;s an interesting question.  Let&#x27;s talk about that a little bit.  I did introduce several bills at different times to abolish the death penalty in North Carolina.  And my two basic arguments were, number one, that the statistics and the studies and all of those things have not shown that the homicide rate was really any different in those states which had the death penalty and those which didn&#x27;t.  The other thing was, the studies showed the death penalty was effectuated most often on the disadvantaged, whether that was because of color, race, that type of thing, or whether it was just poor and people who were outcasts and things of that nature.  In other words, it was not administered in a fair way.  Any rate, added to that the thing that death was final.  And if you made a mistake, as has been done in history, there was no way of correcting it.  But that failed continuously through the entire time that I was in the legislature.  When the question first came up about my coming on the court, I had to think about the question of how I would deal with that.  I concluded that as long as the death penalty is a part of the law, then it is my duty to uphold the law.  So that&#x27;s the approach I have taken to it.  I have voted and gone along with opinions which have upheld the death penalty in North Carolina and will continue to do that where I feel they have been tried in accordance with the law and the law has been followed. So that&#x27;s been my approach to it and as far as I know will continue to be it.  I think the question as to whether it should be a part of the law is a policy question which is for the legislature. And the legislature has made it fairly clear, not fairly clear, it has made it clear in North Carolina as in some other states, that that is a part of our law.  So any rate, the key now seems to be, to have it administered so that only those 43 who commit the worst crimes get the death penalty.  Without going into details, that&#x27;s why we have the findings of aggravating, and mitigating circumstances, and the aggravating outweigh the mitigating and so forth. And it&#x27;s about as good a system as you could get, if you&#x27;re going to have the death penalty as part of the law in North Carolina. AB:  Would you have said that if McKoy had not been overruled? HF:  [laughter] Well, now that you ask about McKoy. and I don&#x27;t know how much we need to get into this for anyone who may hear this later, but just a little history on that.  The United States Supreme Court in the Mills case, which was a case out of Maryland, in effect, said the instructions could be taken to mean that a juror who felt there was something mitigating, would not be able to consider that in deciding whether a person should get the life or death. And so they sent it back.  The question was, whether that case applied to North Carolina law.  And, to me there was just no doubt that the Mills case, which was a United States Supreme Court case, did apply to North Carolina, because North Carolina instructions didn&#x27;t leave any doubt.  They said that each juror had to find each mitigating circumstance unanimously so it was very clear to me that the case did apply. So I dissented to the decisions which this court handed down saying that it did not apply.  And, as you know, we had a lot of those cases, and eventually the Supreme Court of the United States agreed that it did apply. And that was the McKoy case, of course, which said that.  So then we had the question then of whether it was subject to what we call harmless error, and we said, yes, it is, so then all of the cases that had come up, we had to first see if there was error, and then if there was error, was it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. And if we couldn&#x27;t find that we&#x27;d have to send it back for a new sentencing hearing. And so that&#x27;s what we did.  Obviously, I feel that -- not I feel, everybody knows  -- we&#x27;ve got to comply with the decisions of the United States Supreme Court as far as meeting their requirements 44 under the law.  And so it was just a question of whether our interpretation was correct or not.  That&#x27;s sort of the way that went. AB:  I don&#x27;t know if you feel comfortable answering this, but are there any lawyers that have stood out to you in terms of their abilities to argue? HF:  I don&#x27;t know if I want to get into naming attorneys. Some of the members of the Appellate Defender&#x27;s office have gotten really good in arguing the death cases because they do it all the time. Two or three of the persons in the Attorney General&#x27;s office who argue the same type of cases have gotten extremely good on it.  Sometimes we may tend to listen a little more carefully to what they&#x27;re saying, because we know that they really know what the law is in a particular area.  Quite often we will ask the representatives from the Attorney General&#x27;s office, what is the state&#x27;s position on this. A lot of times we&#x27;re thinking not just about that particular case, but about the same type of issues that continuously arise in certain types of cases, especially in the death cases because they become experts in that area. And then there are attorneys who come regularly in other types of cases.  But I don&#x27;t believe I want to get into saying this particular lawyer may be a little better than that one.  I don&#x27;t believe I want to do that. AB:  When you&#x27;re hearing a case, are there any techniques you use, such as taking down notes? HF:  Yes, well, first of all for the most part, and I&#x27;ll just talk about myself.  When I go into the oral argument, I&#x27;ve already read a lot about the case.  I&#x27;m fairly familiar with the issues. And usually there are two or three things that I have some doubt about. And so those are the questions that I ask. Quite often, for example, in my own mind, I have said that the law should go this way. And let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;m thinking of agreeing with the state on a particular issue.  The chances are there are a couple of things I&#x27;m not sure about.  So I will ask the lawyer for the state questions about that.  And quite often 45 the person will go away thinking I&#x27;m on the opposite side, that I&#x27;m going to vote the other way because of the type of question that I asked. And, I think quite often they&#x27;re surprised to find that I write the opinion agreeing with that particular side. And as an aside, I&#x27;ll give you the first time that that type of thing really came home to me was, when I was in the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office, I represented the United States in a case that went to the Fourth Circuit and Judge Craven, for whom the Craven Moot Court Competition is named in Carolina, was one of the judges on that panel.  And he seemed to be the only judge on that panel who agreed with the government&#x27;s position that I was taking.  The others were questioning me very hard, and he would almost argue my case for me.  You know, he would state, counsel what you mean is so and so and so and this is what you&#x27;re saying. So I left that day, I said, well I got one vote on my side. Judge Craven is with me.  And of course he wrote the opinion disagreeing with the United States&#x27; position in that particular case.  And so I found out that what he was doing was being sure that he understood the government&#x27;s position.  And once he understood it, he did not agree with it.  I guess I&#x27;ve used that technique quite often to satisfy myself as to a position.  To just keep pushing that particular question until I&#x27;m sure that that&#x27;s the position and then I know that either I&#x27;m with it or I&#x27;m against it.  I guess my advice to lawyers is when a judge is interested in a particular question and is pursuing it, try to be sure that you present the best side because that may be the key to the question and try not to dodge the judge&#x27;s questions. AB:  Do you have any advice for new members to the court, a young judge? What would you tell them? What kind of advice would you give him or her? HF:  I think one of the bits of advice I would give the new person is to have a thick skin.  And don&#x27;t be insulted by the fact that another justice not only disagrees with what you say, or write, but also doesn&#x27;t like the way you said it.  Along that same line, I would say don&#x27;t be afraid to ask questions.  And 46 don&#x27;t feel that you have to reinvent the wheel.  I found that, I&#x27;ll be specific here, when I came on the court, and I don&#x27;t mind saying this, the first draft of an opinion that I wrote, I circulated it, and Justice Martin came in about forty-five minutes later and brought it back to me, and he had it marked up all through that opinion. He made a lot of suggestions and a lot of criticisms and suggested to me that I should pick up the opinion.  My first thought that went through my mind was, who are you to tell me to pick up my opinion.  Then, after I thought about it, I said to myself, well, he&#x27;s really trying to help me. So I picked up all the copies of my opinion and then I worked on it some more and I made some changes and so forth, and I talked with some other justices about it, and we came out with a fairly good opinion.  But I could have been stubborn and probably would not have had as good an opinion as I did by accepting his suggestions.  And I&#x27;ll have to say that&#x27;s not easy to do, because most people who come to this court feel that they are pretty good and they can write about as well as anybody else.   So it takes a little humility to be able to accept the fact that somebody says to you you&#x27;re not saying what you think you&#x27;re saying. AB:  It&#x27;s easy to be intimidated by a judge, from a lawyer&#x27;s perspective.  Do you think judges are intentionally aggressive? HF: Well, I think sometimes most of us even as judges become a little more aggressive than we expect to.  And incidentally I had to catch myself several times appearing to argue with attorneys and becoming a little more animated than I realized. And how I observed that was listening to the tapes afterwards.  I don&#x27;t think generally judges intend to be.  But we&#x27;re trying to get answers and sometimes we&#x27;re trying to resolve a question in our own minds and we become a little more of an advocate than we intend to be.  But I think that from a lawyer&#x27;s standpoint, obviously you should be respectful towards the court, but if you&#x27;ve got a good point, you stick to it. 47 AB:  You&#x27;ve been a member of the bar for a while now.  Have you noticed a great degree in the different standards that used to be required for admittance to the bar? HF:  I&#x27;m not sure that I can really answer that.  I think that the methods used today are probably better than they were in the time I came along.  I think that, but that&#x27;s a thought without having any real statistics to back it up.  As far as the exam itself is concerned, I looked at the exams and they&#x27;re pretty tough, but they were tough when I came along.  I think there&#x27;s a conscious effort on the part of the bar examiners to get good questions and to grade them fairly. And so I feel pretty good about the present system. AB:  Did you ever face a difficult ethical problem during your practice, any conflicts of interest situations? HF: Difficult ethical situations, hmm. No specific one comes to mind.  When I was practicing law, one of the things I started doing was working with the development of apartments and housing projects and things of this nature, where federal funds were available one way or the other, through the Federal Housing Administration or something of that nature.  And the lawyer who worked with it had to fill out all sorts of forms to disclose any type of interest [that may raise a conflict problem] . TAPE 3 SIDE B [We were speaking about] HF:  the .requirements of filling out forms, disclosing everybody almost that you ever dealt with in any way, anybody you had any financial arrangements with, any associations, things of that nature.  And then later when I organized a bank, I organized a little bank, Greensboro National Bank, and we had to go through the same type of thing, filling out all of these forms and that type of thing.  And so then when I went to the Legislature we had the same kind of thing of the question of filling out forms there.  So any rate, and I recall the questions of the identity of interests as distinguished from the conflict of interests.  In 48 other words, you could have the same interests as some other people without being in conflict.  I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I dealt with that type of thing so much that I became very conscious of those differences.  So I never really had anything I considered a real conflict, you know, to deal with. The question arose when I first, again getting back to the organization of the bank ... I was on the board of the bank, and an officer of the bank, and one of the questions that came up was could my law firm do any work for the bank.  And we looked at it and talked about it and came to the conclusion that, yes, we could. But then there were certain situations where you couldn&#x27;t deal with it.  So as far as I know I&#x27;ve never had any real serious problems of that nature.  One of the things I found out about -- once you get away from the legalities, if you use your good common sense, you don&#x27;t have too many ethical problems. And that, I think, is the key to ethics.  If, aside from the rules, if you look at something, and say now anybody looking at this thing would say that it&#x27;s impossible for this person to be fair in that situation or that they&#x27;ve gotta be biased in it, then your best bet is to leave it alone, stay away from it.  And if you do that you&#x27;re less likely to get into ethical situations. AMY BOENING:  There&#x27;s a lot of talk today about jobs in the legal profession being very stressful and affecting people&#x27;s personal lives.  Have you ever found your career as a lawyer, or as a politician, or as a judge taking a toll on your personal life? How do you manage your many responsiblities? HF: Well, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve managed it nearly as well as I should have.  It can be very stressful.  I still don&#x27;t have the full answer to how to keep it from being stressful.  But some of my techniques are these:  One, I try to concentrate on whatever I&#x27;m trying to do at the moment.  In other words, I may have three things all of which have to be done by Wednesday, and today&#x27;s Monday.  So I have to decide, now which one can I work on today. And while I am working on that, get the other one out of my mind. But if I try to do all of them at one time, the chances are I&#x27;m 49 going to end up Wednesday and none of them are going to be complete.  Or I will have botched the job in one way or the other. Another thing I try to do is to always have some time for some kind of relaxation, some type of physical activity.  I don&#x27;t do it nearly as much as I should, but I know, there&#x27;s just no way you can go seven days a week doing anything and be sound mentally.  And so I try to have a lot of variety in my life and that allows me to work a little longer hours than I otherwise would and do a lot of things without so far having the stress become unbearable. AB:  What sort of outside activities do you participate in? HF:  Well, on the physical standpoint, I used to play a lot of ping-pong which I don&#x27;t play as much of now, but that&#x27;s probably my most enjoyable game. When I was younger I played a little basketball and things of that nature but I can&#x27;t do that anymore.  But I play a little tennis, hit at the golf ball a little bit and I&#x27;m a fairly good bowler, and I love dancing, and so that&#x27;s along that line.  I&#x27;m almost always active in some kind of civic activities, church activities and things of that nature, which again give me some variety, give me a change of pace.  And I work with everything from tutoring students in school and doing a little speaking around and various things of that nature.  So just a lot of different other things, oh, and one of my favorites is watching A&amp;T basketball or football and when I get a little time, Carolina and some of the others.  But that&#x27;s some idea of the variety. AB:  When you talk about your involvement with the church, that&#x27;s your church back in Greensboro? HF:  Now while I work in Raleigh, I live in Greensboro.  So, that&#x27;s where my activities are primarily. A lot of my time in Raleigh is spent working, even at night, sometimes early in the morning.  But I do get my physical exercise here in the sense of ping-pong and things of that nature, bowling. AB:  Where do you play ping-pong? 50 HF:  In the place where I live. We have a ping-pong table there and two or three people who think they&#x27;re pretty good.  So we play sometimes as late as 11:00 at night.  When I get through with that, go and take a shower, I go to bed and sleep like a baby. AB: Did you find it difficult to find time to spend with your family, especially when you were raising your sons? HF:  Yes, that was primarily during the time I was away with the legislature.  So what I did generally, first of all, I would leave on Monday afternoon and come to Raleigh and stay generally until Friday.  But I would call them every night and talk with them about something.  Either at night or sometimes even early in the morning, just sort of stay in contact with them.  And then I tried to find time during the weekends to spend with them.  As they got a little older, both of them became good bowlers and they were in the bowling leagues and they were also in the little leagues with basketball and they played either softball or baseball, I&#x27;m not even sure which one it was now.  So we on the weekends, we traveled around North Carolina, and went as far as Washington D.C. and went south to Atlanta and places like that, bowling and various other things.  So we had a lot of time with them on the weekends. And so while I didn&#x27;t spend nearly the time I would like to have spent with them, we did have a lot of quality time together. AB: From what I understand, your wife is very active in the community and in the education profession. Do the two of you get involved in community activities together? HF: Well, most of our community activities have been separate.  But then we get back together after that&#x27;s over. Now with the boys and their sports and things of that nature, we were together.  So we would maybe go somewhere like on Friday and stay for the weekend for them with their tournaments and things of that nature.  So we spent that time together.  But in the organizations around Greensboro, generally she would be in one and I would be in another.  So we would both take care of that. 51 Actually, she&#x27;s much more active now than she was before I came on the court. Because when I came on the court I gave up a lot of extra-curricular activities and then she has slowly gotten on more and more and more and now I&#x27;ve told her she has too many organizations to look out for.  But she&#x27;s very active in the community and does a lot of good work. AB:  Are you the only judge that keeps his roots back in his hometown? HF:  Oh, no, on this court, let&#x27;s see, Justice Meyer and Justice Webb both live in Wilson and drive in on a daily basis. Justice Whichard lives in Durham and drives in on a daily basis. We were, I guess, the major ones, in fact, the Chief now has even moved his home back to Greensboro.  Justice Exum, Chief Justice Exum.  So it&#x27;s not unusual to live in one place and work in another. AB:  Why did you settle in Greensboro? HF:  Well, I came to Greensboro to go to A &amp; T.  My wife went to A &amp; T and she got a job working there.  Now this is before we were married, of course. And we both liked Greensboro. So when we got married, she had a job as a school teacher at that time, working in Greensboro.  And we had a nice house where we were living in, we didn&#x27;t own it, we were renting it. And she wanted to stay there and I liked Greensboro.  So we stayed there and I started out commuting to Chapel Hill to go to law school. After I finished, I came back.  I still liked it.  I started my practice there.  I&#x27;ve grown to like Greensboro and she&#x27;s grown to like it and you couldn&#x27;t pry either of us away with a shovel. AB:  North Carolina is known to be a rather conservative state.  That may be an understatement. HF:  Well, in a lot of ways, yes, I believe that. AB: Do you feel Greensboro may be more liberal than most North Carolina cities? HF:  I doubt that Greensboro could be accused of being liberal.  It&#x27;s probably more progressive than some parts of North Carolina.  Greensboro has a lot of variety and there&#x27;s no 52 dominant industry, no dominant family, no dominant ruler, I guess you would say, but it&#x27;s a community town.  And I think the Quaker influence has helped, does help a lot -- has in the past, at least.  But it&#x27;s just a great all-American city.  In spite of all of our problems and that type of thing, I don&#x27;t know of anywhere else I would rather live than Greensboro. AB:  What do you envision for the future of North Carolina? Do you see any trends that the state may be becoming a little more progressive in some respects? HB:  Well, with the right leadership North Carolina should go into the twenty-first century as a more progressive state.  I don&#x27;t see any signs of any great movement right at this time, and by saying great movement, I mean great movement either way, but there&#x27;s always hope. AB:  What would you like to see? HB:  Well, I would like to see North Carolina live up to its motto, &quot;to be rather than to seem&quot; and to be, I mean, to do a better job of being fair and open in everything from employment in the state government to encounters in the cities and that type of thing, and I would like to see our industries do a better job of being open in terms, again, of employment and not just employment but promotion and that type of thing.  I&#x27;d like to see us do a lot better job especially with our secondary schools in terms of giving them the kind of support that is needed in those areas and just real leadership both at the local and the state level, and here again, I can&#x27;t talk too much, because as a judge, I don&#x27;t want to get into criticisms of any specific people or parties or anything of that nature, and so I&#x27;m hoping that things will continue, well, I can&#x27;t say continue because I&#x27;m not sure they are getting any better right now, but I think there is hope. Let&#x27;s leave it at that. 53</dc:description>

<dcterms:abstract>Asa T. Spaulding was born in rural North Carolina in 1902, but his scholastic aptitude soon removed him from the farm where he spent his childhood. After a high school education in Durham, North Carolina, Spaulding earned a degree from New York University and received training as an actuary at the University of Michigan. He returned to Durham to take a position at the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, a historically African-American company where he spent his career seeking balance in his professional and personal life. He was president of the company from 1959 until he retired in 1969. Spaulding spends most of this interview describing his early life. He describes his rural community; he remembers applying his disciplined mind to his studies in New York City and Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he experienced some, but not much, racial discrimination; he recalls the transition from reliance on black burial associations to larger life insurance companies and his role in modernizing insurance practice; and he reflects on the nature of citizenship and humanity. Spaulding was a hard worker and a spiritual man who valued his time spent teaching the Bible. A self-reliant man, he cast his vote for Richard Nixon in 1972 but condemns him for his greed. This interview sheds light on a pioneering career and a set of beliefs behind a successful businessman and spiritually fulfilled person.  Researchers and students might also consult the two other interviews with Spaulding in this collection, C-0013-2 and C-0013-3. Those interested in learning more about the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and black business in the South might turn to the interviewer&#x27;s book, Black Business in the New South: A Social History of the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company.</dcterms:abstract>
<dc:description>Library of Congress Subject Headings  [TAPE 1, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  ASA T. SPAULDING: You take a look at that. I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether you&amp;#x0027;ve come across that kind of information anywhere or not. [pause] .   WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;ve never seen this.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And I have excerpts from his will, where it&amp;#x0027;s recorded and everything.  WALTER WEARE: Annabell, who he&amp;#x0027;s talking about, is his sister, Debra. She&amp;#x0027;s my mother&amp;#x0027;s sister; Annabell was my mother.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That goes all the way.  WALTER WEARE: So what relationship would that make your mother, then, to Henry Berry Lowery?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know. [unclear]  for  three hundred years. No, two hundred years. No,Henry Berry was&amp;#x2026; he may have been her uncle.  WALTER WEARE: I believe the figure he was talking about was legendary in the county&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh yeah. Well, he was not only legendary; he was a real person. But there was a lot of legend around him. And he is writing a book, around this whole Lowery family. He (Dr. Earl Lowery) was in Roberson County at a funeral, of my mother&amp;#x0027;s oldest and last-living brother. And he was there for the funeral and he got to talking. And he was telling about he was working on a book. I told him when he was finished with it, I wanted to get a copy of it, because I wanted to trace my family connections.  WALTER WEARE: Does the Lowery family see itself as Indian on black, or a combination of the two?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. They didn&amp;#x0027;t ever consider themselves black. As a matter of fact, that&amp;#x0027;s why they have their own separate school. Even way back when they had segregated travelling on the trains, they always sat in the white section. Never.  WALTER WEARE: So they declared themselves Indians. Your mother, then, saw herself as Indian?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, she was one of them, and yet she married my father, who was about my color. But the way she got into Columbus County was: her first husband was A. McL. Moore. He was one of the Moores from down there. And he was a preacher. And I understand he was quite a speaker. And they used to invite him up there (Pembroke) to preach, at the churches. And that&amp;#x0027;s where he met her. And they married, and he brought her back to Columbus County. Later he died. And my father was her second husband. And there was quite an age differential between her and him (twelve years). She was 100 year old&amp;#x2014;would have been a hundred-and-one if she&amp;#x0027;d lived three more months&amp;#x2014; when she passed in 1965.  WALTER WEARE: Your mother?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: When did she pass?  ASA T. SPAULDING: In nineteen and 65. I have that information somewhere. But it&amp;#x0027;s been within the last 14 years. My father was eighty&amp;#x2014; he was always overweight&amp;#x2014; when he died in February, 1956.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember your mother telling, then, about this Lowery family?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I visited Roberson County with her.  WALTER WEARE: But when you were growing up, would she tell you about them?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Well, you know, there&amp;#x0027;s one thing about them&amp;#x2014;I guess the Indian characteristic&amp;#x2014; they didn&amp;#x0027;t talk much.  WALTER WEARE: When you were growing up, were you aware, though, that she was Indian?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. Because&amp;#x2026;is this on?  WALTER WEARE: Yes.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, put it off for the time being [Laughter] . [interruption]  [explanation by  Walter Weare of identification of tapes, and of interview process using tape recorder.]  ASA T. SPAULDING: I have so many pictures that are really of historical value, with no dates, or no places on them. Because I did not, at that time, ever think that I would want them to refer to for any particular reason. And now that&amp;#x0027;s very important. Because, in my autobiography, if you take pictures, people have to know: when, why, where, who. And while I knew the people at the time, and all, some of them have been so long, that their faces are not so sure. And when you meet so many people in so many different parts of the world, it&amp;#x0027;s hard to reconstruct them after twenty-five, thirty, or forty years.  WALTER WEARE: You have photographs of your family going way back?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Of people along my way, where I&amp;#x0027;ve been, and people I&amp;#x0027;ve met. Just like Chief Justice Warren, when I presented him to receive the citation from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. I remember it happened, and I think it was at the New York Hilton. But I&amp;#x0027;m not sure. And then others, in the city, and you&amp;#x0027;d go through the [unclear] .  Way back. Have a lot of pictures in there. I can identify most of them, even before then. That was probably in the nineteen fifties. When I became a trustee of Shaw University, succeeding C.C. Spaulding, not too long after that, I started looking around to see what I could do to make a contribution, other than being a trustee, to the development of the student fund. Most of them (students) were from the rural areas of North Carolina. Limited exposures. And the thing that caused it to mean so much to me: it was my exposures that were liberating experiences for me, through which I learned how large the world is, and start the people in it. And why so many prejudices were in the white man. So many of them didn&amp;#x0027;t get out of their own state; didn&amp;#x0027;t know what was going on in other parts of the world. Some, you know, of the elite and all did; but the others didn&amp;#x0027;t. It&amp;#x0027;s the masses of the people where your problems are. I won&amp;#x0027;t say not any of them had them, too, but they had more of them to contend with. So I started a discussion with the president. And I had good white contacts at that time&amp;#x2014;not only on the state, but also the national and international level. They were corporate heads. If he was interested, I&amp;#x0027;d be glad to extend invitations to some of my acquaintances to appear there and speak to the student body. And have a question-and-answer period following that. In other words, the idea was to open the windows of their minds to the outside world, and what was taking place in it. So I had people from the state; I had people from other parts of the country; had ambassadors there; had cabinet officers there. So they got a cross-section of world-happening events and people [unclear] And I guess in an eleven-year period, I had over a hundred  people of that type. I remember when I had the chief executive officer of Continental Oil Company to come there. He had never spoken to a black audience before. I was able to get him [unclear] . His public relations man came ahead of him, and spent a  day-and-a-half over there on the campus, sizing it up, talking with the faculty, talking with the students, and getting some ground-work. So he could go back and report to him, you know, as to where he was going and what he would find, and so forth. And he came over there to see me, and asked me a lot a questions. He said, &quot;Mr. Spaulding, you mind me asking you a personal question?&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;How were you able to get Mr. McCollum to come and speak?&quot;  WALTER WEARE: This is the man from Continental Oil?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. See, because he came over on his own private plane, with communications. As a matter of fact, he could fly to different parts of the world and conduct exec. committee meetings from his plane. They&amp;#x0027;d be meeting in Houston, and he&amp;#x0027;d be presiding on his plane [Laughter] . He was  that kind of a person. Because he said, &quot;Shaw?&quot; He hadn&amp;#x0027;t heard of Shaw before, his corporation. It was a black school. And he wanted to know who I&amp;#x0027;d got to get him. I said, &quot;Nobody. I wrote him a letter, extending an invitation, and he accepted it.&quot; That was just a mystery to him. Well, he came. He made a good speech. He was well received. Had a question-and-answer period. And I know it was a refreshing experience to him, because, you know, when you do something that you&amp;#x0027;ve never done before, and you feel like that, that it&amp;#x0027;s out of the common. I look upon it as a soul refreshing experience to have. You know, it broadens you. It&amp;#x0027;s a new facet of your life. And that&amp;#x0027;s the way it seemed to him. And after that, a very warm relationship came between him and me until the time that he retired. I had Christian A. Herter, who was Under-Secretary of state. I had Andrew Brimmer, first black member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I had a good mixture of black an white  WALTER WEARE: This ability you spoke of, that it was not unusual for you to be working with blacks and whites. It was not a new experience for you. And you related that that might have something to do with your background in Columbus County&amp;#x2014;your father and the hunting camps. Do you think that&amp;#x0027;s so?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I&amp;#x0027;m sure it did. As I look back, see, they were building blocks and I didn&amp;#x0027;t know it. And one thing led to another. And the opening of one door led to another. When I first started, and the type of people that I got there, it became easier and easier for me to get top-flight people to accept invitations. Because, when they were told what I was doing&amp;#x2014;in my letter of invitation I would send a list of the people who already had appeared. This man talks about the strategy of success. I didn&amp;#x0027;t think of it in terms of a strategy, but as I look back upon it, and after this chapter that you wrote on it, I said, this has been a part of a strategy of success, bringing the caliber of people to Shaw University I was able to bring there. And the presidents of these other universities would ask the president of Shaw what kind of a budget he had for speakers there. And they couldn&amp;#x0027;t believe it when he told them it didn&amp;#x0027;t cost the University a dime. Never did we have to pay any of those people  WALTER WEARE: Shaw, now, was a Baptist institution?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: And all the Spaulding family was Baptist?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, some were Methodist. I came up as a Methodist until I came to Durham. I was a Methodist until I was sixteen. And Dr. Moore, the one who was responsible for me coming to Durham, was Baptist, and superintendent of the White Rock Baptist Sunday school. Lived next door to the church. After I left Columbus County, he was my &quot;other father.&quot; Because I never did live in Columbus County any more, except the year that I went back there to serve as principal of the school. I was on my own from sixteen.  WALTER WEARE: You left there at age sixteen? And what year were you born?  ASA T. SPAULDING: 1902.  WALTER WEARE: So you left there&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: October the first, 1918. I remember it so vividly. Because I was going further from home than I&amp;#x0027;d ever been before.  WALTER WEARE: And you spent these first sixteen years, then, mostly working on the farm. Tell me a little bit about the school.  ASA T. SPAULDING: It was a one-room school. And all classes, study-hall and everything, took place in the same room.  WALTER WEARE: And the term was built around the harvest season?  ASA T. SPAULDING: The harvest.  WALTER WEARE: How many days would you actually attend school?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I think it opend around the first of October, and it actually ran through February. But at the time they didn&amp;#x0027;t have the requirements that until you were sixteen you had to attend school. So, you didn&amp;#x0027;t go full-time until you finished harvesting your crops. Or, you might go a certain number of days. And if there were something that had to be done on the farm, you stayed out and did it.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember the teacher? Do you remember the name?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. I had several. One was Jonathan Spaulding; another was Josephine Spaulding; a little later, Josephine Freeman; another was L.L. Spaulding. He finally became a professor of Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte.  WALTER WEARE: It sounds like there were as many men as women. Was that unusual then? I tend to think of elementary school teachers as always being women.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, not there. Because it was a matter of the people who went away and got their education.  WALTER WEARE: And Dr. Moore came back and taught, didn&amp;#x0027;t he? Was that kind of a tradition, to go away&amp;#x2026;.?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t think he taught there. He came back every year and spoke at the school, to the students. That&amp;#x0027;s where he inspired me. He and C.C. Spaulding would come there every year and speak at the school there, and at the churches.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think that there were more men teaching at the elementary level, than one might expect, have something to do with there not being economic opportunities for black men in the larger world?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That might have been. But they did have women, though, when I went back there. I had three teachers and they were all women. I was principal of the women teachers.  WALTER WEARE: The teachers tended to come right from that community?  ASA T. SPAULDING: One came from Clarkton, which was about six miles from the schoolhouse. And the furthest away, a lady, Spencer&amp;#x2014;I&amp;#x0027;ve forgotten her first name&amp;#x2014;came from Lumberton, I believe it was.  WALTER WEARE: Now this community was essentially rural. There were two towns there, Whiteville?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Whiteville was the county seat in Columbus County. Clarkton was in Bladen County. But it was only nine miles from this community. You see, Whiteville was on the southern tip of the community; Clarkton was on the northwestern tip. Rosendale, which was no more than a railroad station, was directly north of where I lived. Whiteville was directly south.  WALTER WEARE: Was there a name for this rural community? Was it distinctive in the sense that it had a name that you&amp;#x0027;d know it when you got to it?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, it was more or less the Spaulding and Moore area. In the earliest part of the ancestry, those were the names, but others began to come in. You see, what happened, just like my mother got down there, you see. The movement in those early years, even before slavery&amp;#x2014;in other words, they&amp;#x0027;re not nomads as such, but people who were drifting down? Just like in Europe, you know, when certain tribes, or certain groups would come in as invaders and all. So where the people from Roberson County go down there. My mother was the first one to come into that community.  WALTER WEARE: Do you know anything about the community before she got there?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, I don&amp;#x0027;t know. Because, see, I wasn&amp;#x0027;t born. Where you heard more conversation would be at church after service. People would gather around the church yard and talk. That&amp;#x0027;s where you had your social life, you know. You were working all day on the farm, every day of the week. Except my father had a habit. And he would get in his horse and buggy and drove from place to place, talking.  WALTER WEARE: To visit?  ASA T. SPAULDING: To visit. He would look forward to that, and they&amp;#x0027;d look forward to his coming, to break the monotony.  WALTER WEARE: Was that his tradition that he created?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, it was traditional with him. I don&amp;#x0027;t remember anyone else who&amp;#x0027;d do it.  WALTER WEARE: Not associated with the church?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Just friends, you know. Some were of the Methodist Church and some of the Baptist Church. Had two of them there. We would go to the Methodist Church every Sunday, except the fourth Sunday. On the fourth Sunday, we&amp;#x0027;d go to the Baptist Church for Sunday school, and for preaching services, we&amp;#x0027;d go to the Baptist Church. Because the preacher would come down from Lumberton and preach at the Baptist Church on the fourth Sunday of the month. And they, the Baptists, would come to the Rehobeth Church, which was a Methodist Church, the first Sunday, when they had their preacher. See, the preachers at that time had four churches. One on the first Sunday, the other on the second, and around, make the circuit.  WALTER WEARE: A circuit-riding preacher.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. That was in the early nineteen hundreds.  WALTER WEARE: Is this one of your earliest memories, going to church, or being with your father on these buggy rides?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, there&amp;#x0027;s a little trick I played on him. I don&amp;#x0027;t remember what year it was, but I guess I was about eight. This particular day I hitched the horse up for him, you know, to the buggy. And he got in the buggy. I wanted to go with him, and he said I couldn&amp;#x0027;t go. The buggy had a little covered area behind the seat, you know, where you put groceries and things in there, with a lid over it. I pushed that up and sat in that buggy. And he was driving along, and he didn&amp;#x0027;t know I was with him. He got almost to the first stop where they had a fence with an entrance gate that you [unclear]  to open to get  into this home. And I knew it had to be opened. Before he got out to open it, I stood up behind him. I said, &quot;I&amp;#x0027;m here. I&amp;#x0027;ll open the gate for you.&quot; [Laughter] He was so outdone he didn&amp;#x0027;t know what  to do.  WALTER WEARE: He forgave you for that?  ASA T. SPAULDING: He forgave me. And I rode with him the rest of the round. That&amp;#x0027;s one of my earliest experiences of that type of thing.  WALTER WEARE: What age were you when you started school? Did children start at a particular age?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, no earlier than six.  WALTER WEARE: Were children assigned duties already, on the farm?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, well, that&amp;#x0027;s one thing about rural life, you know. You have a greater sense of responsibility on the farms at an early age than anywhere else. I notice they mature earlier, and they have a sense of responsibility. They can take on and do things that I didn&amp;#x0027;t find taking place when I first came to Durham.  WALTER WEARE: Can you remember the first chores you had?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, get up in the morning and feed the mules and horses. Get up around five o&amp;#x0027;clock and go out and give them their breakfast: the corn and the fodder, whatever, and see that water was drawn for them. That starts early. Then the matter of getting wood in. We cooked with wood and heated with wood, which would come off the land there. It was divided amongst the different ones according to their age.  WALTER WEARE: How many children were in your family?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Five. Three boys and two girls.  WALTER WEARE: Where did you rank in age?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I was the third. I had an older sister and brother, and a younger brother and sister. I was the middle.  WALTER WEARE: We might want to talk about them later, but I want to pursue this matter of life on the farm a little bit. What kind of crops?  ASA T. SPAULDING: We raised corn, cotton, tobacco, hay, that we&amp;#x0027;d feed the cattle with. We&amp;#x0027;d plant a cover crop. We&amp;#x0027;d plant oats and peas. You&amp;#x0027;d sow these peas, you know, and cut the vines.  WALTER WEARE: Field peas?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, field peas. And of course truck gardens. We had everything that you eat. All the vegetables. We raised our own hogs. Another chore was feeding the hogs. One of the boys was responsible for seeing the hogs were fed. Another of us would see that the mules and horses were fed. We always had two mules and a horse, at least two mules. And, of course, the cattle had to be cared for, and water drawn, you know.  WALTER WEARE: And what about your sisters? Was there a division of labor?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They helped in the house.  WALTER WEARE: Would your mother assign their duties, and your father assign the duties for the boys?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I guess it kind of just grew up. Well, he would tell who would be responsible for the mules and horses. There was a division of labor. Well, see, the mother and sisters would help. At that time you had to chop cotton. Both thinning the cotton out as well as keeping the grass out of the crop. It was interesting when I went to Central America the first time, and those Central American countries, and see how they were farming. Even there reminded me of India. You know, they didn&amp;#x0027;t have the plows that would turn it. So it was interesting to see the development. I remember when we got our first Oliver Plow.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A]  [TAPE 1, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  ASA T. SPAULDING: Did you have when I was born on there?  WALTER WEARE: Yes, 1902. And we were talking, I think, about the grade-school experience, and life on the farm. And you were talking about your mathematical skills and you developed that: in part from being in school, but also from your father&amp;#x0027;s general store. You worked parttime in the general store; you worked on the farm; and you&amp;#x0027;re also going to school. What age did you begin having these three roles?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, my role at the chores around the home, I&amp;#x0027;m sure, started as early as six years of age. When we were responsible for feeding the mules and the horse&amp;#x2014;always had at least one horse&amp;#x2014;and the cattle. We raised cattle enough to provide beef as well as milk. And my mother always had a garden, and she liked flowers in the yard. She had some very beautiful flowers, all kinds. And also I remember having in the yard a big pear tree. And I&amp;#x0027;ve never seen a pear tree more heavily laden, sometimes so much that the weight of the fruit would break the limbs. And, of course, pumpkins, and Kershaw. I don&amp;#x0027;t see any of them now.  WALTER WEARE: A kind of melon?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yeah. But all of the different fruits and vegetables.  WALTER WEARE: Did you raise enough of this to sell, or was it just for your own?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Our own consumption; and share with neighbors.  WALTER WEARE: Did your mother and sisters preserve this food?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. She liked to preserve. And another thing, she liked to quilt. It&amp;#x0027;s something maybe some people in this generation don&amp;#x0027;t know what you mean by quilting. But they would have their frames, you know, and quilting. And sometimes they&amp;#x0027;d have neighborhood quiltings, where there was a rectangular or square frame. They would get the cloth they were using, or scraps, whatever it was, that they would baste to it, and use on top. And different ones would be on different sides, and they would meet in the middle, or start in the middle, I don&amp;#x0027;t know which. But anyway you would be stitching. And all of them beautiful quilts, different colors, because of the different scraps they would be using. I remember that all the quilts that we used were homemade. When we left to go away to school, she&amp;#x0027;d give us a quilt to take with us.  WALTER WEARE: Was this a form of entertainment, in part, as well as a necessity?  ASA T. SPAULDING: It was a hobby with them. It was both useful&amp;#x2014;it had utility and value&amp;#x2014;as well as hobby. She would give a quilt away. Another way of how farm people entertained themselves: I remember they used to have corn shuckings. After the corn was gathered and put in the barn, or piled in piles before it was in the barns, the neighbors would come. And, of course, you&amp;#x0027;d have a feast. You&amp;#x0027;d feed them. And then they&amp;#x0027;d go out there that evening and have the corn shuckings. They&amp;#x0027;d shuck the corn in the barns. People looked forward to it.  WALTER WEARE: Would men do the shucking?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Men and women. It was just a neighborhood thing, that people would come together and enjoy themselves helping each other. This matter of neighborliness is another thing. They were accommodating. They didn&amp;#x0027;t look for pay. And I remember for years, when people from Durham would come down there, and they could go into their gardens, bring back all of the vegetables and all of the fruit that they wanted, and they wouldn&amp;#x0027;t mind giving them a ham&amp;#x2014;I mean a whole ham. And think nothing of it. But you don&amp;#x0027;t see that today anywhere. A farm life in a way was a hard life, and yet there were many things in it. It was not exactly communal living, but certainly the matter of the spirit of sharing.  WALTER WEARE: Do you remember other things that people did as a form of entertainment? What about dancing?  ASA T. SPAULDING: The dancing was not so prevalent during the time of my childhood. I left there in 1918.  WALTER WEARE: Was this because of religious restrictions?  ASA T. SPAULDING: There were some people that were so deeply religious that if a person would dance, they&amp;#x0027;d want to put him out of the church.  WALTER WEARE: What about music?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They had music. As a matter of fact, I remember one of the members of the church had a violin. He&amp;#x0027;d play at church, a violin selection, sometimes. And they had the church choirs, and pianos.  WALTER WEARE: Would there be groups that would ever get together and play music and sing; and would any of this be distinctly cultural, having to do with the spirituals?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, not at that time. As a matter of fact, we didn&amp;#x0027;t have music teachers down there as such, except when one of the teachers at the school or someone had gone away and learned music enough to play it for the choirs and things of that nature. They had no set-up for music teachers as such, where the children went to learn music. And many of them, their singing was by rote, rather than by reading music.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think that any of this music was created in that community? That it&amp;#x0027;s genuine folk music, created by the people themselves? Do you remember any of the lyrics, for example?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. I have always said I couldn&amp;#x0027;t carry a tune in a bucket with a lid on it. So, I&amp;#x0027;m not musical myself. My wife is very musical. I guess amongst the many things that attracted me to her was the fact that she was musical. I like music. But I just never could sing. And if I were to try to sing by notes, where it would be a matter of lifting your voice or softening your voice, I&amp;#x0027;d be just a likely to do the opposite, unless I was following someone singing. So, it was not until I left there that I developed music appreciation. One of the things down at National Training School, it was then, 1918, was: two things they had down there that they don&amp;#x0027;t have in schools much now. And that was music appreciation, and you did engage in singing, in the music room. That was part of the curriculum.  WALTER WEARE: That was Dr. Shepard&amp;#x0027;s?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. And the other was the bible. They had a bible course and all of the students had to take it. I never will forget Mrs. Patty G. Shepard. I think she was an aunt of Dr. Shepard&amp;#x0027;s. She had us to learn all of the books in the bible, and divide them into the different parts. The first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch. There were different divisions, you know. And certain passages of scripture that you had to learn, memorize. Certain psalms that you had to memorize.  WALTER WEARE: This training had started early in your life, though, you said, through your grandfather on your father&amp;#x0027;s side. Were you expected to attend church every Sunday?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. We attended church every Sunday. And I&amp;#x0027;m not saying it was as much religious fervor as it was you got a chance to meet the people in the community, to socialize. See, if you&amp;#x0027;re working six days a week, and right on the farm, you&amp;#x0027;re glad to see Sunday come, to see somebody.  WALTER WEARE: Was church then a central institution?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, and when the people would meet there after church was out, they&amp;#x0027;d stand out there in the church yard for at least thirty minutes. Speaking to different ones, you know, and exchanging views, just kind of bringing them up to what&amp;#x0027;s happening in the community.  WALTER WEARE: Were there activities during the week, too?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, except when they had revival meetings, usually in August.  WALTER WEARE: You mentioned the circuit-riding preacher: was there one preacher who was famous in the area, that everybody would turn out to hear? You mentioned one Baptist preacher.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, the Baptist preacher, a lot of people liked to hear him. The Methodist as well as the Baptist always went to Sandy Plain Church on the fourth Sunday, to Rehoboth Church on the first Sunday. And, of course, I think the Baptists claimed that they had the better preacher of the two, the Methodist or the Baptist. Those were more or less social gatherings because at that time you didn&amp;#x0027;t have movies in the area.  WALTER WEARE: Was there a kind of rift, religiously, also between colored on one side and Indian on the other&amp;#x2014;did they have their different preachers?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. The Indian group was a very small group. Had their own church. The colored, at that time&amp;#x2014;I&amp;#x0027;m going to use these words interchangeably because that&amp;#x0027;s the way it was; they were referred to as colored. They could go to the Indian church but the blacks couldn&amp;#x0027;t. They had a few distinctly blacks in the community. They had moved in. Some had followed saw mills into the area. And some would migrate into the area. And generally that&amp;#x0027;s the way it was. You could almost go any place and see someone from down there, and know they were from Columbus County.  WALTER WEARE: By their physical&amp;#x2026;.?  ASA T. SPAULDING: By their physical appearances. All of them had good hair, long hair, and black. Most of them had long, straight hair.  WALTER WEARE: Could the person make the decision, then, whether they were going to be &quot;colored&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot;?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, really, the coloreds didn&amp;#x0027;t [unclear] ; they looked down on the Indians.   WALTER WEARE: Let&amp;#x0027;s say, hypothetically, if you had decided, for whatever reason, that you were going to identify yourself as Indian, rather than colored, would you have been able to do that?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I didn&amp;#x0027;t attend the Indian church from choice.  WALTER WEARE: But by appearance.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I could have gone. At that early age, I had kind of an antipathy on this matter of race differences, or color differences. Because, while my mother had very different feelings about it, I remember I&amp;#x0027;d get into discussions with her on the matter. She did not argue much. She&amp;#x0027;d listen and whatever she had to say, she&amp;#x0027;d say it and that was it. As I said, she was not very vocal. Part of that Indian trait. The Indians in Robeson County at that time were called Croatan Indians. And that&amp;#x0027;s when John White&amp;#x0027;s colony, when the members went back to England for fresh supplies, and when they came back, and the ones that had been left there had moved. And they didn&amp;#x0027;t find any of them. The settlers. The legend is then, sort of the John White&amp;#x0027;s history recorded, that they had carved on the bark of the trees, the word Croatan, C-R-O-A-T-A-N. And when they returned, they knew that there was a settlement further down the river of Indians. They were called Croatan, and they found, according to legend or history&amp;#x2014;whichever it is&amp;#x2014;some of these English settlers had intermarried with these Croatan Indians. As you see in that family tree that I showed you, of the Lowery s. One of the descendents of James Henry Lowery had moved down to Roberson County. And see, the king of England, King George, had given Judge Henry Lowery a grant. And it was either his son or grandson, he settled near Hampton, Virginia, and held court in Virginia. This son or grandson&amp;#x2014;I&amp;#x0027;d have to refer to that to see which it was now&amp;#x2014;moved into Roberson County. And in the will&amp;#x2014;a copy which I have excerpts from&amp;#x2014;where he allotted so many hundred acres: a hundred-and-eighty to this person, or a hundred-and-fifty to the other. And also certain slaves went with the land to that particular descendent of his. And then as you trace it on down, to Henry Barry Lowery, one of the descendents of Judge James Henry Lowery&amp;#x2014;William, I believe it was&amp;#x2014;prevailed upon one of the brothers, or was prevailed upon, to name a new boy child Henry, in memory of some relative. I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether it was Judge Henry Lowery. But in the meantime, he had married Priscilla Berry. And she was Indian. [interruption]  James Junior married a girl, Priscilla Berry, who was one-half Indian, and moved to the site about 1736. I&amp;#x0027;ll read part of this geneology if you want me to. &quot;His majesty James Lowery arrived in Hampton, Virginia in the summer of 1666, with his wife and three sons. Family records show he was born thirty miles from London. One of his sons, James, married a girl from Williamsburg, Virginia, where the Judge also held court. They moved to North Carolina about 1708, where the Little River joins the Cape Fear. (And notations are here where it can be found, documentation). They had two sons, James and John. John signed the Cherokee Treaty in 1806, because he was an interpreter of several Indian languages. Through his father&amp;#x0027;s influence, James obtained a grant of land from George II in 1732, in what is now Roberson County. However he never moved to Roberson. But his son, James Junior, married a girl, Priscilla Berry, who was one-half Tuscarora Indian, and moved to the grant site about 1736. In 1738, the grant was amended and given to James Junior, who died in Robeson County in 1811. A copy of his will in enclosed herewith.&quot; Then it goes on. I have that will in one of the files here. Then it gives the geneology: Judge James Lowery, then James Lowery, then James Lowery Junior, and William Lowery. And this William Lowery was 1750 to 1837, which means he lived eighty-seven years, didn&amp;#x0027;t he? He was a soldier in the Revolutionary War, in Colonel Robeson&amp;#x0027;s regiment. I guess that&amp;#x0027;s why Robeson County was named after Robeson. Then there was Allen Lowery, 1791 to 1867. And then Calvin Lowery, January 15, 1835 to June 10, 1892. This couple had seven sons and five girls. One of the girls was Debra Lowery, who married W.R. Woodell. And one of the other girls was my mother, Annabelle Lowery. Now over here, Henry Berry, according to White&amp;#x0027;s Lost of Colony of 1587. And then Henry Berry the grandson of the above. And I mentioned James Lowery had married Priscilla Berry. Then Betty Locklear married William Lowery. She was the daughter of Dennis Locklear who signed the will of James Lowery. And then Allen Lowery, 1791-1865, married Mary Cumboldt, 1802-1890. She was the daughter of Stephen C. Cumboldt, who was a soldier in the War of 1812. Then Calvin Lowery married Maria Sampson. So the Sampson name is another very prominent name in Robeson County. She lived from March 17, 1839 to March 16, 1908. So that&amp;#x0027;s a part of the geneology.  WALTER WEARE: That geneology would tend to be white and Indian?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right.  WALTER WEARE: Is there any kind of record, oral or written, about when blacks came into the area?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, there are not too many blacks that lived right in the&amp;#x2014;for want of a better word; I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether they&amp;#x0027;d like it or not&amp;#x2014;colored colony. It&amp;#x0027;s still more or less a cluster of the Lowerys, the Sampsons, the Barrys, the Locklears, and all of that mixture in the white group. There are some blacks, but they&amp;#x0027;re not a part of that particular area. They have their own church and they have their own college, you know. Pembroke College.  WALTER WEARE: Would there be persons named Lowery or Sampson who would identify themselves as black?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t think so.  WALTER WEARE: I see. As you travelled through that county, is it identifiable physically?  ASA T. SPAULDING: As you approach it, you begin to see that you are running into the area.  WALTER WEARE: You would not find those who call themselves colored and those who call themselves Indian living next-door to one another?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know. Because, you see, I visited that county very seldom. The last time I was there was for the burial of my mother&amp;#x0027;s brother. That was about two years ago. And the time before that was several years. And then when I visited that county with my mother, it was before I left Columbus County, before I was sixteen years of age. I never did go back there with her after I left Columbus County. But her brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces would come down to Columbus County to visit us, from time to time. As a matter of fact, her brother, Dr. Fuller Lowery, has preached at the church that we attend, Rehoboth Church. But so far as the life-style and the changes in it&amp;#x2026;well, after I left Columbus County, and after my mother and father died, there wasn&amp;#x0027;t much occasion for me to go back there. February the 17th, 1977, I believe it was, I was invited back down there to give a banquet address at the Holiday Inn Motel, where they had a hundred-and-forty people present. For want of a better word, I&amp;#x0027;ll say black and white. And the mayor of the city presented me the key to the city of Whiteville&amp;#x2014;the second time the key to Whiteville had ever been presented to anyone. And the chaiman of the board of education was there; the bank president was there; three of the members of the state legislature, including a senator, were present; and several others in public life, holding key positions in the community. They came to welcome my return after sixty years. And I&amp;#x0027;ve never been more royally treated. As a matter of fact, they had up on the marquis at the motel that I would be speaking there that night. So the people came from all around. My previous trip there was to be the commencement speaker at Southeastern Community College at Whiteville. It was well integrated at that time, black and white.  WALTER WEARE: When was this?  ASA T. SPAULDING: If I&amp;#x0027;d known I was going to be asked, I&amp;#x0027;d have checked the date.  WALTER WEARE: Just roughly.  ASA T. SPAULDING: It was, I would say, about ten years ago, more or less. And the leading citizens of the community were there, black and white. And they came from as far away as Chadburn. Just trying to think back on it, I think probably twenty percent of the student body was black, and/or Indians. And the others were white.  WALTER WEARE: The Indian community, though, has been more exclusive? It&amp;#x0027;s kept more to itself?  ASA T. SPAULDING: It&amp;#x0027;s kept more exclusive. But now, down at North Carolina Central University, one of them is a professor, Maynor. And has been there for a number of years. And one finished law school down there, and became a member of the state legislature. All of this has happened within the last ten years, though. So there has been more loosening of their lives, and moving out and become less exclusive.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think the name of the town of Whiteville bears any relation to this legend about the &amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: About John White&amp;#x0027;s Colony? I don&amp;#x0027;t know. I never thought of that before. But that is the county seat.  WALTER WEARE: Was there a colored family named White when you lived in that area?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, there were people named White. Colored and white people named White.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m thinking of one particular family, George White, the last congressman before Oscar Depriest from Chicago in &amp;#x2026;  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, from that general area. And when I was there, there was a family there. And the head of the family was John White, and he was as white as any white person you&amp;#x0027;d want to see. And so was his hair. In other words, if you were to see him. And yet, he married a brown skinned woman.  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE A] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  ASA T. SPAULDING: The family cemetary down there, or the community cemetary now. You will find the names of the people who were buried there as far back, I think, and maybe beyond, but as I recall, 1777. Long before the Civil War. Which means that they had established families, with their full family names recorded on their tombstones, with date of birth and date of death. There may be some that go even further back in there. But when I&amp;#x0027;ve gone back down there, it&amp;#x0027;s usually to spend the day. Go down in the morning and come back in the afternoon. And it&amp;#x0027;s about two hours and a half drive now. It was a little longer when the roads were not quite as good. And I&amp;#x0027;d go there to a funeral, some relative or something, and while I was there, I&amp;#x0027;d kind of circulate around, and look at some of the tombstones. I remember distinctly seeing 1838.  WALTER WEARE: Small land holders?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, they were land holders.  WALTER WEARE: Do you think there was a time, earlier perhaps, in the nineteenth century, when there was not so much stigma about the three groups intermarrying?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I know there was some black and white intermarriage. Well, they were colored then. Today they would&amp;#x0027;ve been called black. I remember a man who&amp;#x0027;s name was Andrew Mitchell, Sheriff Mitchell they called him. He looked like a sheriff, too. And he got married to a white woman. I can remember that. She was dead. But I knew him. As a matter of fact he&amp;#x0027;d been in my home. And his daughter would easily pass for white.  WALTER WEARE: But the woman who was white, was she from the community or nearby? Or was she an outsider?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know. Because, frankly, I&amp;#x0027;m not sure&amp;#x2014;and I&amp;#x0027;ve not done the research to try to discover it&amp;#x2014;where many of the people who were in that community came from. Now the person who I thought was going to write&amp;#x2014;Professor L.L. Spaulding, who I was talking to you about. I&amp;#x0027;ve learned more from him about the community. The Rehoboth Church, which is over a hundred years old, formerly had a white pastor. In the early years. And I remember him telling me that some of the people who came in there, looked like Indians. One woman who really looked like a big Indian squaw, she could weigh, I guess, two hundred pounds. Tall, and long hair that she wore in plaits. She was a light brown complexion. And I think he said that sometime in the early history some Syrians came through there and maybe there was some mixture. Why the community had people who were so similar in their complexions and all.  WALTER WEARE: I was wondering if it were ever seen as a kind of refuge for people.  ASA T. SPAULDING: It could&amp;#x0027;ve been. We don&amp;#x0027;t know. Because, you see, after America was discovered, after John White&amp;#x0027;s settlers came over here, people began to travel. And nomads would come through there. There was a lot of timberland there. And sawmills would come through there and spend a couple of years [unclear] . And they would bring their workers with them. And  sometimes one or two would be left behind. I know that&amp;#x0027;s how some of the whites came into the community, because we had a Ray family that lived about a mile, a country mile, from where we lived. And members of his family used to help us on our farm, picked cotton. He stayed there, lived and died there. To the best of my knowledge, he came there with a sawmill, working, you know, for one of the sawmill hands. He settled there.  WALTER WEARE: What about whites outside this community, as they saw this intermarriage and so forth? Was there tension if someone who was intermarried, for instance, would go into Whiteville?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, at that time, I don&amp;#x0027;t think in that particular area. I can remember&amp;#x2014;and as C.C. Spaulding pointed out when he went out to Sandford, North Carolina on his first trip from Durham as a salesman; he stopped at Sandford&amp;#x2014;they didn&amp;#x0027;t have separate white and colored waiting rooms. They had one common waiting room. And he was in this waiting room and went to the ticket counter, you know, to get his ticket. When this drummer saw the dilemma he was in and how, when they got ready to go on the train, to show his appreciation for giving him the quarter to make out the balance to buy his ticket, how he reached down and picked up one of his bags and went into the train, helped him put it on the train. 1 traveling salesman And they sat together from there to Raleigh. It was after that,  during the Reconstruction period&amp;#x2014;1896, I believe, to 1900.  WALTER WEARE: It would be a little earlier than that. But the hardening of race relations does, indeed, tend to come in the nineties.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s the information I have. The matter of race was not a big problem as it was in other places. I know it was not as hard then as I found it when I came to Durham.  WALTER WEARE: So that when you went into Whiteville, you don&amp;#x0027;t remember &amp;#x2018;colored only&amp;#x2019;, &amp;#x2018;white only&amp;#x2019;?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh no. I don&amp;#x0027;t remember.  WALTER WEARE: And what about the papers at your father&amp;#x0027;s store? White and black?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, it was for the people in the neighborhood, all of whom were colored. And now you would say black [Laughter]   WALTER WEARE: What about political activity? Would your father vote, for example?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes.  WALTER WEARE: No problems?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No problems.  WALTER WEARE: Was he formally educated?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, I guess he had the highest education that was provided down there, whatever it was at the time he came along.  WALTER WEARE: He went to the same school you did?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I think so, because that was the farmers&amp;#x0027; union school there, in that farmers&amp;#x0027; neighborhood, where the people in that area went to school. About five or six miles west, I guess it would be, they had another school up there. Now, in that particular area, there were more blacks. Not only calling blacks, but blacks. Now, going south or going east toward Wilmington, I guess you could go ten miles, and the people there, my complexion more or less. More or less the same as the people in the area I was born.  WALTER WEARE: In that letter you were quoting, it said something about grant&amp;#x0027;s settlement? Was that a term ever used when you were growing up, to refer to the area that he&amp;#x0027;s talking about?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No.  WALTER WEARE: It&amp;#x0027;s an earlier time.  ASA T. SPAULDING: You see, if I remember correctly from history, when settlers came to this country, you see, the Indians were the only ones were on it. And when the English settlers came, when they would land, they took. They claimed in the name of the king. And the way they became owners of the land were through grants from the king. He gave them title to the land. That&amp;#x0027;s what this is talking about here. King George gave this grant of so many thousands of acres of land to Judge Lowery. And he passed it on to one of his sons, who settled in Robeson County. See, he was in Virginia. And this son migrated to Robeson County.  WALTER WEARE: And the Robeson County experience then, seemed to be more Indian and white experience. And Columbus County as more black-white, but some Indian as well. Was your mother educated? Had she gone to school?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I&amp;#x0027;m sure she didn&amp;#x0027;t have any more than a seventh-grade education.  WALTER WEARE: But she could read and write?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, she could read and write.  WALTER WEARE: You worked, then, in the general store, went to school, and worked on the farm until you were sixteen, and then came directly to Durham?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Came to Durham. Dr. Moore came down there during the summer, after I&amp;#x0027;d been finished with seventh grade. He asked my father, &quot;What&amp;#x0027;re you going to do with that boy? Where&amp;#x0027;s he going to school?&quot; At that time I was considering going to&amp;#x2014;it was called Biddle University; now it&amp;#x0027;s called Johnson C. Smith University. The name was changed because the Smith family made a large donation; but it was Biddle University. Some of the people from down there would go there. This professor Lloyd Spaulding who taught me in the early years, and was teaching at Biddle University then. And he had discussed my going to Biddle. See, the universities at that time, that were named universities, were not necessarily universities. They not only offered college training, but also secondary education. Finishing seventh grade, I could have entered Biddle University, at that time.  WALTER WEARE: Was that true of Shaw, as well?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I&amp;#x0027;m not sure.  WALTER WEARE: That was true of Dr. Shepard&amp;#x0027;s training school.  ASA T. SPAULDING: In 1910 he founded it as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua. And the next change was the National Religious Training School. The Chautauqua was dropped. And then for religious scruples, because he had to seek funds from private sources. This woman, I think it was, this family, she had great wealth. She agreed to make a substantial contribution if he would drop the word Religious. Well, he had to keep the doors of the school open. And it became the National Training School. That&amp;#x0027;s what it was when I came here in 1918. So from 1910 to 1918, it had changed its name three times.  WALTER WEARE: When did it become North Carolina College?  ASA T. SPAULDING: After the National Training School, the next step was the Durham State Normal School. I think that was for either two years or four years. I don&amp;#x0027;t know which. But then the legislature agreed to establish it as the first liberal arts college for Negroes in the state. He had persuaded the legislature to make it a liberal arts college. Then it was the North Carolina College for Negroes. Well, times were changing. They dropped the Negroes and it became North Carolina College at Durham. Because, you see, they had North Carolina State College in Raleigh. To distinguish between the two, this was North Carolina College at Durham. After North Carolina College at Durham&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether there was another step in there before it became North Carolina Central University or not.  WALTER WEARE: What persuaded you to come to Dr. Shepard&amp;#x0027;s rather than Biddle?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh. Dr. Moore. Professor Lloyd Spaulding had told my father that the University would accept farm produce instead of payments for tuition, board and lodging. He could send a hog, or beef, corn, other produce, because they&amp;#x0027;d use it in the dining room.  WALTER WEARE: Did that, in fact, happen?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Dr. Moore came in there. That was what the first plan was, where I would go. And in the meantime Dr. Moore came down on one of his usual visits. I happened to be in the room. He said, &quot;What are you going to do with that boy? Where&amp;#x0027;s he going to school now?&quot; &quot;Well, he&amp;#x0027;s thinking about going to Biddle.&quot; &quot;Why don&amp;#x0027;t you let him come on to Durham? I&amp;#x0027;ll take charge of him.&quot; And so forth. Well, naturally, because he was to me, a hero, who came from Columbus County. He was one of the seven organizers. John Merrick, and Dr. Moore, and other five. You have that; I don&amp;#x0027;t need to repeat that. You know the story of what happened there. Five dropped out in the first year. John Merrick and Dr. Moore remained. And that&amp;#x0027;s when they brought C.C. Spaulding into the picture. So by that time&amp;#x2014;that was 1900 to about 1918&amp;#x2014;the company had quite a reputation. And Dr. Moore and C.C. Spaulding had taken a trip to Cuba. And they had the storm on the ocean, and they were afraid the boat was going to sink. I was familiar with that. So, naturally, it was a great motivation. I grabbed this opportunity.  WALTER WEARE: Was the whole community familiar with the Durham story at that time?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. Because, as I said, they would make their annual visits there, both Dr. Moore and C.C. Spaulding. C.C. Spaulding would leave members of his family down there to visit with their grandparents. For a week, or something like that. So the communication between Columbus County and Durham was pretty well established.  WALTER WEARE: Dr. Moore was seen then by the whole community as a prominent figure.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And not only that. Well, you know the story of the establishment of the Rosenwald Schools in this state? Are you familiar with that? He was a leader in that. He took the money out of his own pocket to finance the effort. Charles R. Moore and George W. Davis, both of whom could pass for white. To provide better Negro education. He had much to do, working through others, to get the State Supervisor of Negro Education office established as part of the Department of Public Instruction in North Carolina.  WALTER WEARE: When Dr. Moore persuaded you to come to Durham&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: He didn&amp;#x0027;t need to persuade me [Laughter]   WALTER WEARE: Was his motive just to get you to come to Dr. Shepard&amp;#x0027;s school?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. It was to come here and I would go to the high school. See, they had a public high school here, which was known as Whitted School then. W.G. Pearson, one of the old citizens of Durham, was the principal of the school. So, I went on over there and registered. And was to repeat the seventh grade, because they figured that coming here with the limited school terms that I had had, and I was a seventh-grade student from a rural area, that I wasn&amp;#x0027;t ready to take on the eighth grade in the city. So, at the end of three weeks&amp;#x2014;I was probably a week late entering the school, getting here the first of October, and public school is already open. So I entered a week or two late. But at the end of three weeks, I think it was, they had the first test. And I remember it was in mathematics and the teacher was a Miss Coleman. I think she was a graduate of Oberlin College. She was good in math. And when the papers were graded, she found that I had the highest grade in the class. She said that I was ready to do eighth-grade work. I had to be able to do eighth-grade work in order to go to National Training School then. So I changed, and entered there, probably a month late&amp;#x2014;or at least two or three weeks late. But that was no problem. I caught up. For the five years there, I maintained the highest average in the entire school, and won the trustees&amp;#x0027; tuition scholarship each year.  WALTER WEARE: When you left, you were given a diploma that was equivalent to what?  ASA T. SPAULDING: A high school diploma. And by that time, they had a black, or colored, school committee in Columbus County in the school that I attended. And they knew me and they knew of my record there. And they wanted me to come back and be the principal of the school. They took it up to the superintendent. And of course, the superintendent usually followed the recommendation of the school committee at that time. And he approved their recommendation. They contacted me. I had already registered at National Training School in the business department when I got this call. And of course, at that time, Dr. Moore had passed. That was 1923 and he died April 29, 1923. This was September. Frankly, I don&amp;#x0027;t know what persuaded me to go, except here&amp;#x0027;s an opportunity to get some money. It may have been to go back down there. I can&amp;#x0027;t recall, you know, whether it was to go back home, and be a principal of a school. And of course, they were anxious; they really put pressure on me to come back there. And I went. Interesting thing there, some of my eighth-grade students were bigger than I was. These big country boys. I remember one there, he was six feet two and probably weighed a hundred-and-ninety pounds. Another was at least six feet two, but was not as heavy. And one of the first students that I whipped&amp;#x2014;at that time we could use corporal punishment. I&amp;#x0027;d go out in the woods there and select my switches and had them in the corner. They had to have study hour as well as class. You were in the same room at the same time. You had to be quiet. And he kept the conversation going, and I spoke to him and asked him to cut it out. And not to let me catch him again. And he did continue. I was on a raised platform. And I called him up there before the whole class and selected my switch. And I reared back, as far back as I could go and came down there across his shoulders. I don&amp;#x0027;t know how many licks I gave him. But I had no more trouble that year from those students. Because I imagine they said, &quot;If he&amp;#x0027;ll take him on [Laughter] , we&amp;#x0027;d better listen.&quot; So I  had good discipline.  WALTER WEARE: And you stayed there as principal how long?  ASA T. SPAULDING: One year. I think school closed in March. And I came back to Durham. See, Dr. Moore, my first summer here, took me to the office one morning. After I had done my chores around the house and had his car out in the driveway and dusted it off. He got ready to go.  WALTER WEARE: You lived with him while you were here?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I lived across the street from him. But I later did live there. He said, &quot;Why don&amp;#x0027;t you go on and go with me downtown.&quot; And I went on. And he took me upstairs to the second floor of the old building. And he turned me over to John T. Merrick, who was the son of John Merrick, the founder. And he was supervisor of this particular department, department. And there was an addressograph machine sitting in the hallway with a stool. He took me there, and that was my first job. I was assigned to John T. Merrick&amp;#x0027;s supervision, to cut addressograph plates, for premium notices to be sent to policy holders. I&amp;#x0027;ve told you this before. His first instructions to me. Now, your plates were cut from the applications for the insurance, you see: the names of the person, the date of birth, and the address. If it&amp;#x0027;s a man, address it as Mr.; if it&amp;#x0027;s a married woman, Mrs.; if it&amp;#x0027;s a single woman, Miss. Because these people living in the country seldom get mail. And when they do get it, it&amp;#x0027;s addressed as &amp;#x2018;John&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;Joe&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;Mary&amp;#x2019; or &amp;#x2018;Sally&amp;#x2019;. To get a letter of premium notice from North Carolina Mutual with a title before their names will give them a feeling of dignity and of being recognized. That thing sunk in. I could see that and I knew what it meant, because I&amp;#x0027;d come from the country. And I knew this matter of calling by first names. Although, in my particular area, as far as my father was concerned, he referred to all the whites by whatever their first name was, and they called him by his first name. There was no title used between either. It was that kind of relationship. But I knew what he was saying was true. So that was my first job. And I worked with the company every summer, while I was at the National Training School. With the money I made as principal of the school that year, and coming back in March and working until September. In the meantime I had discussed where to go to college with Dr. Shepard, and he suggested Howard. So I applied to Howard in September of &amp;#x0027;24, and at the end of the first year, all my funds were exhausted. So I came on back to North Carolina Mutual and worked two years and a summer. I was an early drop out, but for reason. I took what I made in those two years and that summer. My ambition at that time was to become a CPA. I had worked through the different departments of North Carolina Mutual before going to NYU. We had, as I recall, no more than twelve or thirteen black CPAs in the country.  WALTER WEARE: Would it have been possible in North Carolina to be certified?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I don&amp;#x0027;t know. We had a CPA in Georgia, in Atlanta.  WALTER WEARE: Trained in Georgia?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know where he was trained, but I know he was certified in Georgia, J.B. Blayton taught at Morehouse College, and had a CPA firm.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE A]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  ASA T. SPAULDING: I had never been conditioned to feel that I couldn&amp;#x0027;t be. If there was something I wanted to be or wanted to do, I felt it was only necessary to put myself to do it. So that&amp;#x0027;s why I went to&amp;#x2014;I had discussed with Dr. Shepard&amp;#x2014;New York Univesity School of of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance was one of the best business schools in the country. I applied and I was accepted. That&amp;#x0027;s where I ran into discrimination.  WALTER WEARE: Did NYU give you credit for your Howard experience.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t recall whether I got all of it. (I recall that thing now.) I think I got credit for most of it, because I(know I)finished NYU in three years. I took some extra courses while I was at NYU, because there were certain subjects that I wanted. I took more than was necessary to graduate. And another thing: I graduated magna cum laude, and was the second black to be admitted to the Delta Mu Delta scholarship society, which was similar in the school of business&amp;#x2014;was the equivalent&amp;#x2014;to the phi beta kappa in liberal arts college. You had to be there at least three years and maintain the average&amp;#x2014;whatever it was&amp;#x2014;for those three full years, in order to make it. I never will forget: a letter came, and I looked on it and saw the Delta Mu Delta key insignia on the back of the envelope. I had heard about Delta Mu Delta, but I didn&amp;#x0027;t know&amp;#x2014;in other words, I wasn&amp;#x0027;t conscious enough of it to be striving to do that. Because my attitude always in school, was to take whatever the curricula required and try to do your best in every subject. Because it&amp;#x0027;s put there for a purpose. And anything that you learn can&amp;#x0027;t do you any harm and it might stand you in good stead. I remember my classmates, my first year at National Training School. We had to take Latin. First year Latin.  WALTER WEARE: This is at NYU?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, at National Training School. Oh, how they talked about it, how they referred to it as a dead language, no use for it. But, I found it interesting. I found it challenging. And I found that it helped me to understand the meaning of words without having to go to the dictionary. Therefore, I took all three years. First year Latin, Ceasar and Cicero. I was tops in all of them. The same thing in geography, history&amp;#x2014;well, every subject I took. I had the same attitude. And that&amp;#x0027;s why I maintained the highest average in the school. The entire school, the whole time I was down there. I won a trustee tuition scholarship. So, there again, I went to NYU, and had the same attitude, in my study habits. And, although at NYU I had to work in the cafeteria during lunch hour and got my meals free. And I worked in the post office as a subclerk in the evenings. And I had to find time in between to do my studying, and come out as I did.  WALTER WEARE: Now, as I recall, you were telling once before about your living arrangements.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. You see, when I went there, I had applied for admission. They had one dormitory for school of commerce students&amp;#x2014;Varick House. And I had applied and sent the deposit, and was accepted. If I&amp;#x0027;ve told you this, I won&amp;#x0027;t repeat it.  WALTER WEARE: Well, I think it&amp;#x0027;s important to report it.  ASA T. SPAULDING: All right. That&amp;#x0027;s where I felt this matter of discrimination probably more keenly than at any time before. And when I presented myself, and had my trunk and all there, delivered there, and went in to obtain my room, they questioned whether or not I had reservations. I told them I had, and I had my receipt for it, and I showed it. And the house manager, or whoever it was&amp;#x2014;I found out later he was from Charlotte, North Carolina&amp;#x2014; but he was in charge there, and he came and he saw that I had my receipt, and that I had been admitted. So his approach was to try to persuade me not to insist upon it. He said, &quot;Because, you know, there are a lot of Southern students here, and they will make it miserable for you.&quot; Well, he was probably right in 1927. &quot;And the circumstances under which you would have to stay would be most difficult, and it could even result in your not being able to pass your examinations.&quot; Well, I listened to him and all. I said, &quot;Still I&amp;#x0027;d like to have my room.&quot; Well, I don&amp;#x0027;t remember all the details of that now, but in the final bottom line of it, he had my check in his hand. And he said, after he told me about how it would be unpleasant, and I wouldn&amp;#x0027;t enjoy it at all and so forth and so on, he handed me my check. And, thoughtlessly, I accepted it. But I went directly from there to the NAACP office and reported the situation in detail. I told them that he had returned the check and I had accepted it. They said, &quot;Well, there isn&amp;#x0027;t anything we can do for you. If you had not accepted that check, we might have forced the issue.&quot;  WALTER WEARE: The sense of the contract was no longer valid.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. Because he had offered the refund and I had accepted it. So then I had a half-sister that lived up on 144th Street. I remember the address: 242 West 144th Street. I went up there and stayed with her the whole time I was there at NYU.  WALTER WEARE: That&amp;#x0027;s some distance from NYU, isn&amp;#x0027;t it?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. NYU was down on 4th Street. I had to used the elevated train back and forth over there. So, you see, I&amp;#x0027;d get from the post office anywhere from eight thirty, nine, nine thirty at night, and would have to get up in time the next morning to catch that train, to be down on 4th Street by eight o&amp;#x0027;clock. I&amp;#x0027;d get off the elevated train and have my breakfast at a Greek restaurant right there at the foot of the steps, and go on over.  WALTER WEARE: Aside from NYU, did living in New York City have a large impact on you as a country boy coming to the big city.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, no, no. Because when I came here and went to Whitted School that first day, I was countryly dressed, for all that means. And the city boys were well dressed. And I remember I had heavy brown shoes on. And they had these ribbed, between a clay color and a more yellow&amp;#x2014;try to imagine&amp;#x2014;brown shoes, and wore long, ribbed stockings. And they wouldn&amp;#x0027;t have anything to do with me, neither the boys nor the girls.  WALTER WEARE: Was this typical dress from where you came from in Columbus County?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, naturally. You know old farm boys. I had a Sunday suit. See, we had our everyday clothes, and we had our Sunday clothes [Laughter] And, of course, short trousers, that would  bloom over the knee. That&amp;#x0027;s what I came here with.  WALTER WEARE: I see, what were the city kids wearing?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I think they were wearing long pants.  WALTER WEARE: White shirts, or anything like that, to set them a part?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, they wore their ties and their shirts and all, yes. They dressed better then then they do now. See, this dress, the way they&amp;#x0027;re dressing now, started a few years ago. Where was it? In New England, on the street somewhere, where they&amp;#x0027;d dress as shabbily as they could? to this country. And then the denims and all.  WALTER WEARE: So, you weren&amp;#x0027;t overwhelmed by New York City then?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, I wasn&amp;#x0027;t overwhelmed.  WALTER WEARE: Of course, you had been to Washington already. Did it have an impact on you, nonetheless? Harlem?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I enjoyed going to the movies on Saturday afternoons, or Sundays.  WALTER WEARE: This is the Harlem Renaissance?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. The Resaissance Theatre was there, and the Savoy Ballroom, and another place over there on Lennox Avenue, Small&amp;#x0027;s Paradise. Of course, I didn&amp;#x0027;t have the money to splurge, but I took in some of the things. But I didn&amp;#x0027;t have much time. I had never had any time for sports. When it was National Training School, four o&amp;#x0027;clock classes are out, I had to come back home and do my chores around at home. In the morning, I was up at five o&amp;#x0027;clock to fire the furnace, sweep the house, mop it, dust it, the sidewalks out in the front of it, get the car out, and dust it, ready for Dr. Moore after breakfast. And as soon as I had breakfast&amp;#x2014;I had my meals there&amp;#x2014;I had to leave for school. So I didn&amp;#x0027;t have much time here for it.  WALTER WEARE: What were the sports? Were they the same as now?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, they had football; they had baseball. Down at the Training School they had a good baseball team, as well as a fairly good football team.  WALTER WEARE: And back in Columbus County, were there sports?  ASA T. SPAULDING: We had baseball only.  WALTER WEARE: Were these community teams, or school teams?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Just the school teams.  WALTER WEARE: Would there be community teams, and leagues?  ASA T. SPAULDING: It hadn&amp;#x0027;t reached that point at that time.  WALTER WEARE: While I&amp;#x0027;m thinking about it: the North Carolina Mutual apparently had a team for a while. Was there a kind of city league in which they played? Who did they play?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That was a softball league, I think it was. The girls mostly. And then North Carolina Mutual sponsored the John Avery boys&amp;#x0027; club team, I think it was, the first year [unclear] .   WALTER WEARE: But in rural North Carolina, in Columbus County, there were not organized baseball teams?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, you see, this was long after that.  WALTER WEARE: But this is an interesting point about entertainment and how people spent their free time.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, at the noon hour down there at the school, they had a baseball team. But I couldn&amp;#x0027;t make it. They had better players. See, they had what they called captains. And you take this bat. I don&amp;#x0027;t know how you do it. And whoever came out on top would choose his player, and the other would choose another. And they&amp;#x0027;d always choose the best players. And they had some pretty good players, some good pitchers and base players, and good batters. But I just wasn&amp;#x0027;t that good.  WALTER WEARE: In New York, then, you didn&amp;#x0027;t have time to&amp;#x2026;.?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Only on weekends was I able to go to a movie or show, or something of that nature. [interruption]   WALTER WEARE: And you worked in the evenings at a post office?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right.  WALTER WEARE: I was trying to get at any impressions you might have gotten in the twenties, of New York City.  ASA T. SPAULDING: When I went to NYU, there were not many black students there. I don&amp;#x0027;t think there was any class that I had where there were more than two, including me. There were some where I was the only one. But I was always a good student. And during study hour or in the library, I had no problem at having plenty of students wanting to study with me.  WALTER WEARE: Harlem at that time was seen as&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Now, on Sunday afternoons they had the intercollegiate association. See, you had Columbia University, New York University, and City College. And the students would have a forum on Sunday afternoons, from three&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t remember whether it was one hour or two hours&amp;#x2014;from three to four, or three to five. And we&amp;#x0027;d have programs, and people participated, and discussed subjects of interest. Just like they do now. But this was the students in these universities, most of whom lived in the Harlem area, you see. And I think it was held on 125th Street, if I recall now. Regular meeting place. And we always looked forward to that.  WALTER WEARE: Was your picture of Harlem a positive one, then? This is a period when Harlem is generally seen as flowering.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That was a glamour time there. Lou Leslie&amp;#x0027;s Blackbirds, you know, of 1928. Florence Mills, the great singer. And all the bands would come there and play at the Savoy or Small&amp;#x0027;s Paradise or the old Apollo Theatre.  WALTER WEARE: What about the literary set? Were you aware of people say, like Langston Hughes, who was writing at the time?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. In one of my classes of literature, we had to study Langston Hughes and Counte Cullen, the writers of that day. And Claude McKay.  WALTER WEARE: Did you meet or see any of these persons while you were there?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I met none of them.. I don&amp;#x0027;t think I ever met Claude McKay. And I was just trying to&amp;#x2014;Langston Hughes. I don&amp;#x0027;t think I ever met him.  WALTER WEARE: And DuBois was in New York at this time.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. DuBois was there. I remember Fred Moore, the publisher of the New York Age. And Watson. I think the first two blacks to be elected to the board of aldermen of New York City. That was a day when a lot of history was being made. I think my first vote that I cast in a presidential election was in New York City.  WALTER WEARE: In the election of &amp;#x0027;28?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I think it was. Because in 1924 I was at Howard.  WALTER WEARE: So it would&amp;#x0027;ve been Hoover against Al Smith in &amp;#x0027;28.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I think it was. That&amp;#x0027;s where I registered and voted. My first presidential election. So that brings us up to that point. [interruption]   ASA T. SPAULDING: My last class in the afternoon was from three to four. And he was my instructor, my professor. He was a parttime teacher there, while he was a consulting actuary for some of the insurance companies. And he also wrote books and published them. As a matter of fact I used one of his texts of casualty insurance down at the Wall Street Division. And I had done well in his courses. So he focused his attention on me.  WALTER WEARE: His name was Ackerman?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yeah. S-A-U-L. Saul B. Ackerman. A-C-K-E-R-M-A-N. And this was about three weeks before school closed. He made an announcement that he was going to do something that he had never done before, and it was to have exemptions from the final examination. And there were four students who qualified for exemption. And he read the names, and I was one of them. And when the class was over, he asked me what I was going to do after class. I told him I had to go to the post office; I had to be there at six o&amp;#x0027;clock. He said, &quot;Well, I&amp;#x0027;d like very much for you to drop by my office. There&amp;#x0027;s a matter I&amp;#x0027;d like to discuss with you.&quot; I said I&amp;#x0027;d be happy to. So, I went in and he asked me to be seated. His first remark was: he knew he had learned of my connection with North Carolina Mutual, of my working there during the summer. He had had that much interest to get some background on me. And I guess being a black student and all, he wanted to get some background on it, too. He said, &quot;I&amp;#x0027;d like to take you and make you the first Negro actuary in America. You can work in my office and get your practical experience, and I&amp;#x0027;ll teach you the theory on the job.&quot; In other words, on the job training. The thought had never entered my mind. Because I was there to be a CPA, and the courses I had taken were to prepare for that. This presented a challenge. And I always responded favorably to challenges, and I said, &quot;Gee, I appreciate that. But the officers of North Carolina Mutual are expecting me to come back there the first of June, full time.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I&amp;#x0027;ll be glad to go down there and talk with them, and tell them what I&amp;#x0027;d like to do.&quot; Well, without belaboring it, I mentioned it to them, and they said they&amp;#x0027;d be glad to have him come. And he came. Took the train, came down in the morning, and went back that afternoon. Met with the exec. committee and told them just what I told you. Of course, C.C. Spaulding was president then, and they expressed their proper appreciation and so forth, for the interest he had shown, and they&amp;#x0027;d take it under consideration, and hear from them. So, Mr. Spaulding went over to Raleigh to see the insurance commissioner, Dan C. Boney. Well, there was a question in their minds whether or not, if I went and got the training, I&amp;#x0027;d be able to practice it. Because North Carolina Mutual was operating principally in Southern states. And the actuary society being a closed society anyhow, whether it would be time wasted or not. So, anyway, Mr. Spaulding went over there, and they met with him. And he was very open and very fair about it. He said, &quot;Your company has reached a point in its development, where it needs its own actuary.&quot; See, up to that time, we had used all consulting actuaries, all white consulting actuaries. As a matter of fact, the actuary for the Durham Life Insurance Company, E.T. Burr, was consulting actuary at that time. He had been the actuary for the insurance department before he went to the Durham Life Insurance Company. And he and Mr. F.B. Dilts, who was then actuary for the Home Security, had come to the Home Security from the insurance department. And he was a consulting actuary, too. So he told him, &quot;Your company has reached the point where it needs its own resident actuary. If you have anyone in your organization who has the appitude for it, and the interest in it, by all means I would recommend that you encourage it. The only difference I would make was, instead of him following the course that has been suggested, that he go to the University of Michigan.&quot; Because the University of Michigan was one of the two schools in the country then that was preparing, scholastically, the actuaries. See, some of the insurance companies, like Metropolitan, were training their own actuaries. They&amp;#x0027;d take a liberal arts person, finish his liberal arts course, and bring him in there and carry him through [unclear] . It so happened at  that time, that the actuary for the North Carolina Insurance Department was a Michigan product, too. So he had a double reason for suggesting the University of Michigan. &quot;If he goes there, he&amp;#x0027;ll get all the formal training and everything else, and will do it quicker, than going through this on-the-job training. Naturally it&amp;#x0027;ll be to the benefit of the company to get it as soon as possible.&quot; So he came on back and told me what had happened. And I applied to Michigan immediately&amp;#x2014;the next day. And fortunately I was accepted, and went there in September.  WALTER WEARE: This is what year now?  ASA T. SPAULDING: 1930. I finished at NYU first of June, 1930. I borrowed the money to go there, with the understanding that it would be deducted from my salary.  WALTER WEARE: The money was borrowed from the Mutual?  ASA T. SPAULDING: From the Mutual. And it would be deducted from my salary each month until it was paid off. I signed bills receivable for it. So that was it. Now: my experience at Michigan. I remember the first morning I walked into my class. There was a young man from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I was sitting in the seat next to the aisle on one side; he was sitting in the seat next to aisle opposite me. I walked in and took my seat. I was the only black in the class. He gave me his back. And I saw what he did. But I paid no attention to it. The first week, of course, they&amp;#x0027;d make the assignments. The course was in mathematics. And the method was to have you go to the board and put your problem and the solution to it on the board. Of course, it couldn&amp;#x0027;t have been a better course for me (laughter) than mathematics. I would always be amongst the first to get the  problem solved. And you know, within six weeks, that guy was studying with me. And I remember&amp;#x2014;I&amp;#x0027;m trying to remember whether it was a course in finite differences or what&amp;#x2014;but there was a problem there. And the equation went all the way across the blackboard on that wall. And he was calling it out to me, the problem, as I was putting it on the board. And I had it, and I started with the solution. And he stopped me. He said, &quot;Mr. Spaulding, I hope you will pardon my interruption, but I have a confession to make. This is the first time that I have ever had anything to do, or have met, a Negro, except the maids in our home.&quot;  WALTER WEARE: This is the professor saying this?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. This is the fellow from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Student. And he said, &quot;I just am so embarrassed. You know, I wish you could go home with me Christmas and could meet my parents.&quot; And so forth, and so on. And from then on, the ice was broken, I mean all the bars were down. And the other fellow was from Amarillo, Texas. Art Roberts. We got to be such chums.  [END OF TAPE 2, SIDE B]  [TAPE 2, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  ASA T. SPAULDING: The two years that I was there, we developed a fast friendship, and we kept it up. I came back to North Carolina Mutual, and he went to Bankers Life Insurance Company of Iowa. And we kept up our correspondance for years and years. I remember when I went to Iowa on my way to my family to California in 1954&amp;#x2014;which was twenty-two years later&amp;#x2014;I called him on the telephone. I didn&amp;#x0027;t have a chance to visit with him. And he was so sorry that we couldn&amp;#x0027;t get together. Because, naturally, we were motoring you see, and we wanted to get where we were going. But I just felt that I should call him while I was there.  WALTER WEARE: This is the fellow from Tuscaloosa?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. This is the fellow from Amarillo, Texas.  WALTER WEARE: Did you ever hear from him again?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Tuscaloosa. We kept up correspondance for a while. But it petered out. I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether I was the fault or he was. I know that I wasn&amp;#x0027;t going to Tuscaloosa, Alabama [Laughter]   WALTER WEARE: Were you the only black student in the actuary program there, or in those classes?  ASA T. SPAULDING: There was an Indian student, an East Indian student in two of the courses. There was a Korean student in one of my courses in mathematics. And frankly, I don&amp;#x0027;t remember any other black students in any of those courses at Michigan.  WALTER WEARE: What about in the student body as a whole? Would you see blacks on campus?  ASA T. SPAULDING: There weren&amp;#x0027;t many. Very few. And most of those who were there were in the professional schools. Now, there were a few women students from Detroit who were there. And I remember the first woman to stay in the dormitory at Michigan was a daughter of a physician in Detroit. He was a very prominent physician. And she applied and was admitted. I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether they knew beforehand what her race or identity was or not. But I know that she was admitted and stayed there. And, of course, it was very much a subject of conversation, about her staying.  WALTER WEARE: Now you didn&amp;#x0027;t live on campus?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. I lived with a private family.  WALTER WEARE: A black family?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes.  WALTER WEARE: How was that arranged? Do you recall?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, they had certain available residences, approved residences, for the students on campus. And this was one of them. It was a very nice home. A nice arrangement, not too far from campus. I stayed there the whole two years that I was there.  WALTER WEARE: Did you feel more isolated though, in that area, than you had in New York? By that I mean socially.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Because on the campus, you see, it was only in the evenings. During the day I was over on the campus. I took my meals in the Michigan Union there.  WALTER WEARE: Had you tried to go to, say, the theatre in Ann Arbor?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, we went to the theatre. That&amp;#x0027;s what I say. This fellow Roberts and I went to the theatre all the time together.  WALTER WEARE: What about restaurants? Did you notice a color line being drawn?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Because of the campus environment; any students who were students at the University of Michigan. I attended a big white church right on the campus. And the minister&amp;#x2014;oh, he became a bishop shortly afterwards&amp;#x2014;but he was quite a speaker. And they had a black church, too. I alternated between there and the church that had a black minister. He was a very good speaker, too. Very good.  WALTER WEARE: So there was a substantial enough black community in Ann Arbor to have a church?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. Although I don&amp;#x0027;t think he had more than a hundred members, more or less. And a lot of the black families who were there, so many of them worked at the University in some capacity.  WALTER WEARE: When you took your degree there, did you come immediately to Durham?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes, I came here. And at that time, Mr. Dilts was still a consultant. And in the meantime, while I was at Michigan, the consulting actuary firm from Height, Davis &amp; Height from Indianapolis&amp;#x2014;I think they came in here the same year &amp;#x2014;when I say &amp;#x2018;came in here&amp;#x2019;: North Carolina Mutual&amp;#x2014;the same year that I went to the University of Michigan. And the company was having problems with its mortality and expenses. And it was just making it through. I mean, as I recall, the surplus was less than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars at that time. They were concerned. So this actuary had quite a reputation; had done a lot of consulting work. I don&amp;#x0027;t know who put him in touch with us. But anyway they came in and put out a new line of policies, industrial policies in particular. But they&amp;#x0027;d never done any consulting work for a black company before. And they brought the same kind of policies with all the benefits that the white companies were using. And we had an entirely different clientele. And they had a two-year contract with us. So the year that I came back&amp;#x2014;that was in June of &amp;#x0027;32&amp;#x2014;I began to get orientated and get the department set up, and arranged to go to Metropolitan for further study and all preparatory to it. As of January the first, 1933 I became actuary of North Carolina Mutual.  WALTER WEARE: Had you served an internship? Was that the practice?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, at that time, if you call it, those last six months all they did was check what I was doing.  WALTER WEARE: But that was here, not at their company.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. All Mr. Dilts did was have conferences with us to see how I was getting along, and anything I wanted to ask him. But, you know, up until that time we had never filed an annual statement with the insurance department in which the gain and loss exhibit was completed and balanced. The first annual statement that you will find in the insurance department of North Carolina with a complete gain and loss exhibit in balance, was the one that we filed for December thirty-first, 1933. And it so happened that my first year as actuary was the year the examiners from the insurance department came in. And when they checked my valuations at the end of that year, they couldn&amp;#x0027;t find anything wrong. And they found the gain and loss exhibit in balance.  WALTER WEARE: Would an actuary typically be doing that kind of work? It sounds like you were also doing the bookkeeping.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. We had a statistical department, and I worked with a statistician those six months. When I came in, those first six months was to try to find that fifth point on the compass that the Chinese talk about, which is the most important&amp;#x2014;where you are. And then North, South, East, and West. So I began to delve into the records and to check on things that they were doing, and so on. Then after I got into it my first year, I went back over old annual statements and made studies of what had been done, and how and why, and things that I thought could be improved upon. And then our mortality, as I recall, was about one hundred and thirty percent of our expectancy. Or I believe one year was about a hundred and forty one. I don&amp;#x0027;t recall now. But all that information we could find in the insurance department.  WALTER WEARE: What was the chief cause of mortality?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know whether I want to release this particular thing or not, but he increased the premium rates twice in one year. What they would do was make adjustments in the premium rates rather than improve underwriting. I came in here. I studied our mortality. I got all our death claims and reviewed every one of them as to the age of death, cause of death, plans of policies, beneficiaries, relationships of beneficiaries to the insureds, who paid the premiums to see if they were speculation on sick members of the family. See all of that was going on. We really didn&amp;#x0027;t have a well-functioning underwriting committee. And in order to determine that this was it, is why I reviewed all these death claims. Both ordinary and industrial. And then charted it to show what was happening. And where death had occurred within the first year of insurance, and the second and the third, on up to the fifth year. And where they did, what the cause of death was. And then look at the application and the examination or lack of examination. Because I had studied numerical rating system and underwriting at the University of Michigan, and was quite familiar with it, and with looking at that application and seeing whether or not the plan of policy applied for was the plan of policy that should have been issued. Or, whether or not, it should have been rated up, or whether or not it should have been rejected. And when I finished with those studies&amp;#x2014;I don&amp;#x0027;t know what the year was; I didn&amp;#x0027;t try to remember because it was all in the record&amp;#x2014;it resulted in&amp;#x2026; You see, prior to that the medical director alone approved all the applications. And this resulted in setting up an underwriting committee, consisting of the medical director, the actuary and the claims supervisor, who was approving the payment of claims. See, the medical director approved the application; the claims supervisor approved the payment of the claims. I brought the two things together. And the result was I was given veto power by the company. Even if the other two approved it, I could veto it.  WALTER WEARE: Are these for ordinary policies?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Ordinary or industrial.  WALTER WEARE: Would you generally have time to look at all of those?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Where the beneficiaries were distant members of the family. See, to have an insurable interest, you must suffer a pecuniary loss in the event of the death of the person. And ordinarily that&amp;#x0027;s husband or wife, or father or mother. And where you find that some cousin has applied for a policy on a younger person, and you go back and check on that, you find that&amp;#x0027;s a person who&amp;#x0027;s already sick, or may even be in the hospital. And death may occur within a matter of months rather than years. And those were the kinds of things that were sifting through. So we set guidelines. If the beneficiary is other than husband or wife, father or mother, or son or daughter, those applications have to come by my desk.  WALTER WEARE: You think in some cases there was collusion between agents and&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, there was! You see, if they were writing them, and no question was ever raised, people do a lot of things. So first we had to find out the causes, and secondly, we had to educate our agents. And I wrote articles that appeared in publications on these things, and would list and show what was happening in these cases. It was a part of our education. And after doing that, the next thing we had to do was educate our agents, in underwriting. And as these things developed, our mortality began to come down. And another thing we found, at that time, they hadn&amp;#x0027;t discovered antibiotics. And pneumonia, heart trouble were the principal causes of death. And where you had poor underwriting&amp;#x2014;and this was not just peculiar of North Carolina Mutual; even Metropolitan did it&amp;#x2014;if a policyholder died from tuberculosis, pneumonia, or heart trouble (industrial policy holders), within the first year, or the first six months, they wouldn&amp;#x0027;t pay full benefits. Because we knew there was speculation. Especially in the matter of relationship of beneficiary was such that there was no insurable interest, And they would pay one-fourth the face amount, or one-half the face amount. And after two years, you&amp;#x0027;d have to pay full amount.  WALTER WEARE: The feeling was that the person had been sickly at the time of the policy.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. And what really was doing, was requiring the applicant to be a co-insurer for part of the risk, for that first year. Or, at most, for the first two years. After that the company assumed the full risk. That&amp;#x0027;s what it amounted to. And if a person is in good health&amp;#x2014;and most of us after a while, feel like we&amp;#x0027;re going to live forever, you know&amp;#x2014;you don&amp;#x0027;t pay too much attention to that. Surely I expect to live another year. And it&amp;#x0027;s better to do that than to have my policy rejected.  WALTER WEARE: These were Depression years, though. You came here right in the heart of the Depression. Was there fear that the company might not survive? Was this an extra burden?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, no. I didn&amp;#x0027;t have a fear that the company would not survive. Because we had been through the bank closing holidays. The Mechanics and Farmers Bank was one of the two banks in Durham that re-opened their doors when the ban was lifted. Some of the others went into receivership. North Carolina Mutual&amp;#x0027;s management had always been conservative. Any mistakes that they made were mistakes of the head, not of the heart. Because after operating for nine years without an examination, one thing they knew: that the money that was there didn&amp;#x0027;t belong to them. It belonged to the policyholders. What it didn&amp;#x0027;t take to operate the company belonged to the policyholders. And with that first examination, you&amp;#x0027;ll find written in there: &quot;Everything was found intact.&quot; Which was quite a testimonial to ten years of operation without any supervision. The people were of integrity and honor.  WALTER WEARE: How do you explain that during these lean years that people were either able to buy new policies or keep them up? These are still mostly industrial policyholders?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. Well, our production, our increase was not as great. As a matter of fact, there were two years there where I don&amp;#x0027;t think we put on any increase. We merely held our own.  WALTER WEARE: How important was the black community in Durham, at that time, in your volume? What percentage would you say?  ASA T. SPAULDING: We had pretty good volume.  WALTER WEARE: Were these persons working for the tobacco factories?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. The tobacco factories suffered less, you know, during the Depression. [interruption]   ASA T. SPAULDING: I had to revise all of the policies of Height, Davis &amp; Height. Because they came here with double indemnity and triple indemnity and fifty percent bonus for keeping it enforced for five years in event of death by accidental means. And as many of our people with these old broken down cars and accidents they were having, and the way they were killing each other, the courts were holding that anything was an accident to the person [Laughter]  even if  he was murdered. In other words they were prescribing for a patient they knew nothing about the peculiarities, the history of the patient. And on the basis of the studies and analyses that I made, I knew that the company, under no conditions, could survive. And I had to revise those policies and tighten them up here and tighten them up there. And then the other thing that I did was get special types of policies to try to meet different situations. I combined pure endowment with a whole life policy. In other words, we still issued the whole life policies regularly. And then for classification purposes, where there was questionable risk, we didn&amp;#x0027;t want to reject it. But we couldn&amp;#x0027;t insure them on the regular policy. I combined two hundred and fifty dollars worth of pure endowment with seven hundred and fifty dollars worth of life insurance for the thousand dollar unit. Now what that said: if that person lived out that endowment period, even though it was a whole life policy, he would collect his two hundred and fifty dollars and would continue his insurance with the seven hundred and fifty. And he could buy that in units, see? A thousand, two thousand, five thousand, or whatever. With five thousand, he&amp;#x0027;d have twelve hundred and fifty dollars of pure endowment, and thirty seven hundred and fifty dollars worth of life insurance, to make the five thousand. And those policies had a good conservation record. Many people collected their pure endowment at the end of the period of the endowment, and continued their insurance [unclear] .   WALTER WEARE: The endowment feature encouraged them to keep up the policy?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. And what that was was a certain amount of co-insurance. Because if they died earlier, the pure endowment was not payable. And it was on the law of averages that it accrued to the policy holders as a class. But it was a means of preventing abnormal mortality experience, or above normal mortality experience. There were many innovations that I brought into the company policies I hand&amp;#x0027;t even seen anything like. But they were things I learned about in Michigan. I knew about pure endowments, and term insurance. And I knew how to combine the two; you can combine it with anything else.  WALTER WEARE: Were there complaints from the policyholders?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, but I had a hard time selling it to the insurance department. I got in quite a controversy with the actuary of the insurance department, when I wanted to change the mortality tables. I wanted to get out some preferred risk policies for the better class risks, and I wanted to go from the American Experience Table, which was the original table, from Shepard Holman, I believe back in 1866 or somewhere back there, it was. And we were using it. And I felt that we had developed our underwriting to a point, and that there were risks that to even look around us, we could see were good risks, and would have a more moderate mortality table. I wanted to use the Metropolitan Intermediate Table of Mortality, of 1912&amp;#x2014;which was a long way from 1860-something. And the actuary, he didn&amp;#x0027;t know. And I had my mathematical calculations and demonstrations, and I insisted that we could do it, and wanted to do. Well, to make a long story short, I won my argument with him. I&amp;#x0027;d never had another argument with him the whole time he was with the insurance department. The Burial Association in Chicago had called me in to do some consulting work for them. And they wanted to convert from Burial Association into an old-line legal reserve life insurance company. It had never been done in the state of Illinois. And I went there. And being a black actuary, they didn&amp;#x0027;t know whether or not the insurance department of Illinois would take my work, or go through with the conversion.  WALTER WEARE: This is in the thirties or later?  ASA T. SPAULDING: That was in 1944.  WALTER WEARE: This was a white burial association?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No, it was a black burial association.  ASA T. SPAULDING: And so the president, their accountant, their general counsel, and I went down to the insurance department with them with the proposition that I had worked out. Whereby it could be done. How the Burial Association&amp;#x0027;s policies would be assumed when it was converted into the life insurance company, and how the adjustments would be made and so forth and so on. And I had a line of policies for them. So we went down there and brought in the general counsel for the insurance department, the policy analyst who goes through and analyzes the policies, you know, to see that all the provisions conform to the insurance laws of the state of Illinois. There were four of them, including the actuary. But these other three were in there. We&amp;#x0027;d gone through the whole policy, analyzed it and the method, the steps to be taken. When they had finished all that and were ready for the actuary to come in and give his final approval to recommend to the insurance commissioner, the door opened, and here walks in the actuary for the insurance department of Illinois. He was the actuary that I had the controversy with in the North Carolina insurance department, and that I won. So he asked the others, you know, what their counsel was, and they told him and so forth. And he turned to me and said, &quot;Asa, do you recommend this? Do you feel it&amp;#x0027;s a sound thing?&quot; I said, &quot;Without reservations.&quot; He turned to them and said, &quot;If Asa Spaulding recommends it, I&amp;#x0027;ll approve it.&quot; Those people who were with me were shocked. What I want to do now, in connection with my autobiography, I want to get that documentation from the Illinois department&amp;#x2014;copies of the papers of approval&amp;#x2014;because I intend to use it in my autobiography. Because my information is that after that was done, the method that I worked out became the standard procedure for the legislation for the conversion. Because Illinois was full of burial associations. It became the standard procedure for conversion of burial associations to life insurance companies in the state of Illinois.  WALTER WEARE: Did you become, then, a kind of consultant to other firms?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. And I understand that within about five years &amp;#x2026;.  [END OF TAPE 3, SIDE A]  [TAPE 3, SIDE B] [START OF TAPE 3, SIDE B]  WALTER WEARE: Do you think that&amp;#x0027;s true?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Could&amp;#x0027;ve been. I wouldn&amp;#x0027;t want to make a judgement on it.  WALTER WEARE: This one, apparently, was interested in reform.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I know the insurance departments were so concerned that they did require them to convert.  WALTER WEARE: Did you have the same kind of impact in the South, or in North Carolina, for example?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, I never had many arguments with any of the insurance departments that I didn&amp;#x0027;t win.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m thinking about other firms, now, who wanted to convert.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t think we have any burial associations in North Carolina now.  WALTER WEARE: There were no other black burial associations in North Carolina?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. they had some more in Illinois. The Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Company of Illinois: it was a burial association. All of them were converted. But Jackson Mutual Life Insurance Company was the first one. It was Jackson Mutual Funeral System.  WALTER WEARE: But in North Carolina they had passed out of existence by this time?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Didn&amp;#x0027;t have too many. As a matter of fact, I had no interest in it. Had no reason for following it up. And I only got involved in the one in Illinois because this company, for some reason or other, was interested in doing it. Now, whether the pressure was being brought from the insurance department, I don&amp;#x0027;t know.  WALTER WEARE: Would black policyholders working class people, would they resist maybe going from the old traditional burial society fraternal organization over to a more secular kind of insurance company?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Because these fraternal organizations insurance plans: I don&amp;#x0027;t hear too much about any of them.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m thinking now when you were here in the thirties.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, they had the fraternal organizations. Remember the Royal Knights of King David; but it went out of business. The insurance companies put them out of business.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m just wondering if there was some reluctance on the part of the masses to make this change?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, they liked rituals. But people don&amp;#x0027;t pay that much attention to it now. It used to be, every time a Mason died, they&amp;#x0027;d have the rituals. It&amp;#x0027;s seldom done now, very seldom. People have gotten away from it, the ceremony.  WALTER WEARE: How important was the&amp;#x2026;.?  ASA T. SPAULDING: They served their day and generation. I look upon the things that have happened throughout our civilisation in the nations of the world, and the rise and fall of nations. Each one had a role to play. It&amp;#x0027;s part of the changes, part of developing a nation and a people, and a society and everything else. I started years ago to having a brotherhood day and goodwill day on Sundays at our church.  WALTER WEARE: This is White Rock?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. I remember in 1963, I invited Abraham Harmon, ambassador from Israel, to be the brotherhood day speaker. And he made a statement that I will never forget, in going back and reviewing history. He said, &quot;It is never given to any man to complete the great tasks of life, but it is given to every man an opportunity to make his contribution toward that completion.&quot; You take it in political life; you take it in legislation; you take it any way you want to. The people, just like the national insurance&amp;#x2014;you know about national insurance? And how long we&amp;#x0027;ve been arguing about that? And presidents that have come and gone? And is still with us? At some time it will be; but the person who starts with the idea may never see it. And whether you take it in political life&amp;#x2014;just like in business. I served my day and time. As I look at North Carolina Mutual, I think there was a day and time for every president that North Carolina Mutual has had. I think he had something special to offer at that particular time. And I think it&amp;#x0027;s fortunate it&amp;#x0027;s that way. It would be tragic if the thing stopped at the passing of a person. If there wasn&amp;#x0027;t somebody else to pick up the mantle and carry on. Would we get anywhere? So, as I look back and study organizations and things of that nature, I was a fraternity man. But to me, now, I just don&amp;#x0027;t have time to fool with it. I feel there&amp;#x0027;s too much time spent for too little. There are other things that are more worthwhile and can contribute more to society, than the time and energy spent on some of these things.  WALTER WEARE: Did you think this philosophy in the beginning, came in part from your background and values, the kind of traditional values?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I&amp;#x0027;ll tell you. I think really my continuing to teach this bible class that I have in Sunday school had more influence on my life. At the truth, and all. Starting with my grandfather, the bible has had more influence on my life and my philosophy of life than anything else that I know of. And I don&amp;#x0027;t mean to be sanctimonious; I&amp;#x0027;m not trying to be that. But I think there are certain universal truths. And somehow or other, as I look at things, how they&amp;#x0027;re happening and to people, the rise and fall of people, what causes them to rise and fall: overambitious, vanity. You take Nixon. I voted for Nixon when he first ran. But here was a man who could have gone down in history as one of the greatest presidents that this country has had. Because he had something. He had an asset. But he had a liability that outweighed it. Just like when he took that foreign trip and came back here, bringing those costumes and all. He had something that was just eating at him. He could have been reelected in what was it? 1972?  WALTER WEARE: In &amp;#x0027;76 he would have run.  ASA T. SPAULDING: He could have been reelected for his second term without ever resorting to the tactics he did.  WALTER WEARE: It was &amp;#x0027;72, yes.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I mean there was no one on the scene who could have defeated him, but yet, he was so possessed with this overriding ambition that he put his dependence in the wrong things. He opened the doors to China. Many things that he did. And he had the possibility, if he could&amp;#x0027;ve just kept himself disciplined. First man to bring the presidency shame and disgrace. Tragic. Both to him, and maybe, to a certain extent, the country. And another passage, &quot;&amp;#x2018;Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,&amp;#x2019; said the Lord&quot;. The most dramatic experience that I&amp;#x0027;ve seen of that was the Shah of Iran. Two years ago, nobody would have thought it was possible. And the ambassador from one of my very good friends, [unclear] . We became very good friends. I&amp;#x0027;ve attended several  parties at the Iranian embassy. And I have something sent me by him. Correspondance. But the point is: I think the Shah was trying to bring Iran into the twentieth century. But I think he was too far away from his people. And, as to whether or not he recognized that people power is just as important as military power. And when we put our trust, our dependence in treaties and might and power, and everything else, there&amp;#x0027;d better be some spirit somewhere. You can take the best football team and put it on the field with no spirit. There&amp;#x0027;s something that spirit maketh alive. I think that early training, and the lessons that I learned, and I studied these things. Whether you take it literally or not, or take it symbolically, or whatnot. There are certain universal truths that if you test them in the crucible of history, you find that sooner or later.  WALTER WEARE: When you came to Durham, you came under the tutelage of people who would reinforce this, perhaps. Is that true or not? C.C. Spaulding, Dr. Moore, especially. And that raises an interesting question about Durham, this notion that Durham was special, a middle class here that was different than say, a middle class in Harlem, or a middle class in Atlanta.  ASA T. SPAULDING: It&amp;#x0027;s been historically true that the major officers, and not only them but the clerical staffof North Carolina Mutual, have all been church-going people, have taken leading roles in church life. That doesn&amp;#x0027;t mean that they lived a perfect life; nobody does. But they had an ideal; they had a goal; they had a certain sense of values. The frailities of human nature are just such that even if you try to take biblical characters. Paul said, &amp;#x2018;Behold when I would do good, evil is ever present.&amp;#x2019; He was always having to fight it, have a struggle. Anyone has a struggle, because there are so many temptations. And you take people who get themselves involved financially, and bind themselves in the of the law. Just like the president of this bank up here, Northwestern. And just like Smith Bagley now, the Reynolds family. Greed doesn&amp;#x0027;t pay. And I have said over and over again, in my scale of values, a man&amp;#x0027;s true worth to society is better measured by the contributions he makes to it than by what he takes from it. Because you can&amp;#x0027;t take it with you.  WALTER WEARE: And these values were here when you came in to Durham, were they not? As you travelled and say, went to Memphis, an important town for black insurance, did you see a different life style there among the so-called $ack middle class?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Uh huh. Well then, North Carolina Mutual has always said, it was not organized to try to make millionaires, it was organized to be of service to its people. That&amp;#x0027;s why it was organized as a mutual company, rather than stock. Go to Memphis, those are stock companies. It was suggested to the officers years ago to convert North Carolina Mutual into a stock company and make a million. They&amp;#x0027;d have no part of it.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m interested in the fabric of life here, the social life, how people&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Social life is important here, but it&amp;#x0027;s not all. You find some cities where people strive to be the social leader. People like social life here, but it&amp;#x0027;s not the all-goal in life. It has it&amp;#x0027;s place.  WALTER WEARE: What kind of outlets would there have been say in the thirties or forties?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Families, or certain people, they would have parties and things, then, and still have them now.  WALTER WEARE: But with segregation, there were no restaurants by and large, and no theatres.  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Well, you see, you had your own black theatres. Had some nice theatres here in the thirties, very nice theatres, and very nice shows&amp;#x2014;first-run shows. I mean, the movies.  WALTER WEARE: Were there other forms of entertainment? Were there stage shows, vaudeville?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, they would have their dances. And the sororities would have their parties, you know, and dances, and things of that nature.  WALTER WEARE: What about music here? Did the big bands come in?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Uh huh.  WALTER WEARE: Both jazz and&amp;#x2026;  ASA T. SPAULDING: Yes. But where they got too rowdy I didn&amp;#x0027;t go to.  WALTER WEARE: Was there a kind of distinction then in entertainment that working-class people might prefer one type of music?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I wouldn&amp;#x0027;t categorize it that way, but a lot of working-class people were just as sober and sane.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m trying to get at this texture of this fabled black middle class in Durham, if they had a distinctive social life and community institutions that would set them apart.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s a judgement decision, or opinion, and I&amp;#x0027;m not sure I can read the innermost thoughts or feelings well enough to make a statement to go down in history, as categorizing it.  WALTER WEARE: Well, there&amp;#x0027;s this outside view. Frazier wrote about it, saying that in Durham, you find none of the life and leisure you find in Harlem, but rather the Protestant ethic, the work ethic.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s true. I&amp;#x0027;m a firm believer in the work ethic.  WALTER WEARE: How that translated itself into everyday life. Was there, as he was suggesting, less excitement in a way?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I&amp;#x0027;m a firm believer in balance, a balanced life. And you can take that any way you want to. You can look at it from a business standpoint&amp;#x2014;a balance sheet. If it&amp;#x0027;s out of balance, that corporation is unhealthy; it&amp;#x0027;s not well managed. And it can be out of balance in many ways: in forms of investments, or as liabilities exceeding its assets, or the proportion of assets of one type or another. You have a different expense from when it&amp;#x0027;s in better balance. If the chemistry of your body is out of balance, you don&amp;#x0027;t have a healthy body. You may have diabetes; you may have this or that or the other. And I think that thing runs through life. When the forces of nature get out of balance, what do you have? The tornadoes, the floods. In other words&amp;#x2014;well I guess that says it. I may be&amp;#x2014;and if I am, I am, I have to be me&amp;#x2014;I may be from this modern standpoint, an old fogey. But I think there are some eternal values that will hold good anytime. Now, honesty may not seem the best policy to the person who wants to get rich quickly, but he may get it improperly, and then he may wish later he didn&amp;#x0027;t have it, because of the consequences. Another lesson&amp;#x2014;and I don&amp;#x0027;t want to fill that too full of references to the bible&amp;#x2014;but you know the parable of the rich farmer, who had such a harvest that his barns wouldn&amp;#x0027;t hold it. Now, he didn&amp;#x0027;t say a thing about sharing it, did he? He said, I&amp;#x0027;m going to tear down these barns and build me new ones, and put it all in there. And then for what? So that I can sit down and tell my soul to be at ease, because I don&amp;#x0027;t have to worry anymore the rest of my life. He didn&amp;#x0027;t see anybody around him that he could share it with. The thought didn&amp;#x0027;t occur to him. And what does the parable say? Whether this actually happened, I think it&amp;#x0027;s good teaching. &amp;#x2018;Thou fool. This night thy soul is required of thee. To whom shall this go?&amp;#x2019; What&amp;#x0027;ll happen to it? All we remember about him is not the good he did, but how foolish he was in his value system. So these kinds of things, and I guess travel and exposures, and meeting all kinds of people and all kinds of circumstances. I had an experience with Idi Amin in Liberia in 1976. And when I read what happened yesterday, I wasn&amp;#x0027;t surprised. Because these things may flourish for a season.  WALTER WEARE: When you met him in &amp;#x0027;76 something happened?  ASA T. SPAULDING: No. Just to size the man up. The way that he came into the church that Sunday afternoon to the services. This whole thing just covered with&amp;#x2014;what do you call them?  WALTER WEARE: Medals?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Medals, yes. And two .44&amp;#x0027;s, one on each side. And he sat through that sermon, and the way he looked, a solemn, mean look on his face. Not moved by anything. I said, &amp;#x2018;Is this a human being? Is it possible for him to have any empathy for anybody?&amp;#x2019; And then I heard of some of the atrocities that happened under him, and I saw on T.V. the other night, Shakespeare&amp;#x0027;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and in the end how things turned out. And I thought of that statement, &amp;#x2018;The measure you meet is the measure that will come back to you.&amp;#x2019; If you really study life and people, the rise and fall of nations, and things like that, it seems to me like I see a thread running through there that says something. I didn&amp;#x0027;t want to preach a sermon laughter.  WALTER WEARE: I think that&amp;#x0027;s a good way to end here. [interruption]   ASA T. SPAULDING: I mean, Johnson was the one who needed to be on the scene.  WALTER WEARE: You don&amp;#x0027;t think that Kennedy&amp;#x0027;s assasination may have assisted him in some way. That is, that Kennedy was seen in part as his legacy?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Well, I think the thing that helped Johnson so much was his tenure as majority leader of the Senate. And he knew where all the bodies were; and he had helped so many of those Senators, and their positions, and their chairmanships and all, that he could just crack the whip and they jumped.  WALTER WEARE: He had a lot of debts to call in.  ASA T. SPAULDING: That&amp;#x0027;s right. And then being a Southerner, too. He was not a Yankee. Although when he ran for president he was from the Southwest rather than the South. He didn&amp;#x0027;t see the country ready to be running as a Southerner; which Carter did run as a Southerner. But a lot of things had happened between then.  WALTER WEARE: Let&amp;#x0027;s come back to that. As I mentioned, as I was checking over what we had done yesterday, there are some things that occured to me that scholars would be very interested in. One has to do with land. Land is so precious and so important, and as I listened to the tape, I failed to ask you how people got the funds to buy this land, and who they bought it from?  ASA T. SPAULDING: I don&amp;#x0027;t know what the practise was back then, when settlers came here. Whether they had to pay for the grants, or the grants were just made to them to claim.  WALTER WEARE: I&amp;#x0027;m thinking about after the Civil War.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, after the Civil War, well, yes, that&amp;#x0027;s a different situation. Back in the early years. See, 1666 was pretty early.  WALTER WEARE: Yes it was.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Let me see if I can&amp;#x0027;t find something else. Does that letter tell you anything about how much land he gave to different ones?  WALTER WEARE: No.  ASA T. SPAULDING: (searching through papers) I have some more information. I can show you the pictures of the two younger people whose grandmother and my mother were sisters. And they&amp;#x0027;re living in Baltimore now. They came over to Washington, the Washington-Hilton, to have dinner with me.  WALTER WEARE: Now these persons appear to be absolutely white, uh huh.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Now their grandmother and my mother were sisters.  WALTER WEARE: They&amp;#x0027;re quite aware of their ancestry are they?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, they&amp;#x0027;re living in Baltimore, and they had seen news about me in the Washington papers and all. And they wrote me; Christine wrote me. Because they are interested in tracing their roots. You know, &quot;Roots&quot; got everybody interested in it. And they wanted to contact me, and for us to exchange information, from my mother&amp;#x0027;s side. And they sent me material. They were the ones who gave me Dr. Earl Lowery&amp;#x0027;s address. So I wrote him.  WALTER WEARE: Yes, that&amp;#x0027;s the man&amp;#x0027;s name who I thought we ought maybe to read into the record because he seems to know as much as anybody. He&amp;#x0027;s the one who&amp;#x0027;s drawn up this geneology that you read from yesterday. Why don&amp;#x0027;t you read his name and his address there, and also quote&amp;#x2026;.  ASA T. SPAULDING: I can read the whole letter if you want me to.  WALTER WEARE: All right. He talks about a book there.  ASA T. SPAULDING: Did I show you this yesterday?  WALTER WEARE: This is another geneology?  ASA T. SPAULDING: Is this the one I showed you?  WALTER WEARE: I think the one I saw was&amp;#x2026;. it&amp;#x0027;s the same?  ASA T. SPAULDING: It&amp;#x0027;s a copy.  END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is Ben Bulla in the home of Alice Miller Davis Abernethy.  She is the daughter of Alson T. Davis, a very loyal employee of ~B. Everett Jordan.  She is also the widow of Jake Miller who was also a very trusted employee.  This is Thursday, December 8, 1983. BB:  Alice, if you will, please tell me something about your own family background; how you came to Saxanahaw, or were you born there? AA BB AA BB AA I was born there. Where did you dad come from? He came from Orange County, just a few miles out of Chapel Hill When he came to Saxanahaw did he have a family? He and my mother came to Saxapahaw in 1906, not long after they were married. BB:  Did he work for White-Williamson Co.? AA:  Yes. BB:  What was his job with them? AA:  Mechanic--same thing with Jordan. BB:  So when Everett Jordan came in 1927 he just stayed on. AA:  Yes. BB:  When the White-Williamson Company closed in 1924--and they were closed until 1927--what did your daddy do then? AA:  I believe he farmed one year.  I remember him talking about it; I don&#x27;t remember it, but I think he said he farmed one year near Saxapahaw where Mr. Ceton Quakenbush lives now. BB:  Now he called Mr. Jordan, Mr. JERDAN didn&#x27;t he? AA:  I don&#x27;t remember that.  I believe he called him Mr. Jordan. BB: 0. K. maybe it&#x27;s someone else I&#x27;m thinking about. He was a master mechanic, and as such, he worked very closely with Everett Jordan--doing what? AA:  Everything that needed to be done, including working on that dam, even when it was a wooden dam when Mr. Jordan first came there. Alice D. Abernethy                                   2 I can remember as a small child dad having to get up at all hours of the night and go to the power house and working on those engines, and repairing the dam when the water got too high.  I think he did everything that could be done.  I have known him to go three nights in a row without sleeping. BB:  Do you remember any stories about when they moved the diesel engine down highway 54 to Saxapahaw? AA:  I don&#x27;t remember any details but I do remember the trouble they had getting it there. BB:  What did your daddy think of Everett Jordan? AA:  Well I can honestly say that I have never heard him say a word against him.  If he did I didn&#x27;t hear it. BB:  Why was he so fond of him? AA:  I think it was because Mr. Jordan was so down to earth with him, and he would just come down and work with him a lot of times when he first came to Saxapahaw.  You know in starting out he would get down and do the dirty work with him.  They did a lot of work together in the beginning, and I think that he tried to speak to daddy on his own level he didn&#x27;t try to act like a &quot;big boss,&quot; or anything over him.  I think daddy had a lot of respect for him for that reason. BB:  I know that Everett Jordan thought very highly of him and if he had any problem mechanically he always turned to your dad for help. AA:  Well for years he was the only one there. BB:  He knew where every power line was, ever water line-- AA:  Every pipe line he could tell you.  He didn&#x27;t keep any records he just remembered. BB:  Right.  He had an amazing memory didn&#x27;t he. Alice D. Abernethy                                   3 AA:  This was due to his lack of education, I feel. BB:  He must have had a photographic memory. AA: Yes. BB:  People have told me that he did things that they didn&#x27;t know how he did them. You know when I ask people for funny stories and anecdotes they seem to have trouble remembering.  Your daddy enjoyed a story and a joke too; do you remember any of the stories or jokes he told about Saxapahaw? AA:  I wish I could remember; there were plenty, but I really can&#x27;t remember any right now. BB:  I have the same problem  I heard some stories too and I can&#x27;t remember. AA:  That&#x27;s one of my problems; is remembering things. BB:  Did your daddy ever go off with Everett Jordan hunting or fishing? AA:  I don&#x27;t remember.  Dad was a hunter. BB:  Everett Jordan was not, as such, but he did like fish; he liked catfish particularly.  Was your daddy a fisherman? AA:  He liked to go deep-sea fishing; he didn&#x27;t fish around in ponds or anything. BB:  Who were some of your daddy&#x27;s close friends down there.  Jim Crutchfield would be one. AA:  Yes, he would be one and-- BB:  Who worked in the shop with him other than Robert Hunter. AA:  Gallowey--Ek--Echol Galloway.  He married one of the Bloxsom girls--remember? BB: that was before I came I think. AA:  Well he worked with him a long time.  I can&#x27;t remember those Alice D. Abernethy                                   4 things, because really, I didn&#x27;t go down to the plant very much. you know, where dad was working--unless T had to go see him about something.  Mr. Bloxsom might have worked in the shop.  I can remember one more--Smith--Albert Smith.  He&#x27;s living in Burlington. I bet he could tell you a lot. BB:  I&#x27;m glad you thought about him.  I know his son Charles, but I haven&#x27;t seen Albert in years. Let&#x27;s go back to Saxapahaw when you were a small girl.  What did it look like as a village? AA:  [Laughs] Well, it looked pretty drab sometimes. BB:  Do you remember when Everett Jordan came? AA:  Barely, just barely.  In my memory, his house looked then about like it does now; the other houses were not underpinned; they were cold.  I believe we lived in the house on the curve then, and of course there was no running water in the houses.  There was a spring out in the back.  I can remember my mother sending me out there to wash turnip greens.  She would say, &quot;Change the water four times,&quot; and it was just like ice.  Isn&#x27;t that funny, I can remember that so well, and I was so small.  I remember when we got running water in the house, it was such--it was wonderful. BB :  How did you heat the houses? AA:  Coal heaters at that time. BB:  And what did you cook on? AA:  My mother had a wood stove I think. BB:  Wasn&#x27;t an oil stove? AA:  No.  I think she had one of each later.  This was when I was real young--as a child. BB:  What year did you leave Saxapahaw? Alice D. Abernethy BB AA BB AA:  &#x27;65. BB:  Then you saw the changes that took place when Everett Jordan was there.  What were some of the changes that took place in the village? AA:  Well I think they improved the houses a lot, and of course Mrs. Jordan was always working with the yards and roadsides coming into Saxapahaw.  She improved it quita a bit as far as making it more beautiful.  They improved the houses somewhat, I thought. You&#x27;d be unaware what happened inside the mill? That&#x27;s right. How about the people themselves in Saxapahaw; did you see any change in the people as far as-- AA:  Oh yes, because when I was going to school I knew everybody there, and as the years went by, especially in the &#x27;30*5 during the depression when so many people moved in from Gastonia--we started seeing new people and from then on it was different.  But before that we knew every family in the village, where everyone lived; we never locked a door--that was unheard of. BB:  The newcomers from Gastonia; were they equal as citizens you think to what we already had? AA:  I think so.  The ones that I can remember--they seemed a little strange, of course, [laughs] BB AA BB Bu t as far as character and citizenship they were about equal? I think so. What are some of the changes that have taken place in Saxapahaw during the time you lived there? AA:  Well, --- BB:  What I&#x27;m trying to say is:  What influence did Everett Jordan Alice D. Abernethy                               6 his mill, or his family have? AA:  Oh I think they had a lot of influence --especially in the church and the schools.  I started to school in &#x27;27; that&#x27;s the year they came there.  I went to school in the little wooden schoolhouse in the first and second grade, then we moved into the new one--brick school when I was in the third grade.  I&#x27;m sure he had some influence in getting that school--!&#x27;m just taking that for granted. BB:  In what respect did he have an influence on the churches? AA:  Well I can remember being in Mrs. Jordan&#x27;s classes; she was always teaching. belong BB:  Did you /  to the Methodist Church? AA:  No I didn&#x27;t belong to a church, I just went. BB:  Back to cub scouts:  You may be right, Mrs. Jordan may have organized that because when I came to Saxanahaw in &#x27;42 they did not have a cub pack. AA BB AA BB AA BB I remember working with her as a den mother for some time. What kind of worker was she? She was good--she taught me all I knew. Was Gary in the cub pack? Yes. If you have an extra picture I&#x27;d like to have one. Now let&#x27;s go from that to Jake.  Now here is an area where you probably have a clearer memory of what Jake&#x27;s relationship was.  What did Jake think of Everett Jordan? AA:  Well as I said before, he admired him very much.  He was always helpful in any situation that Jake ran into--in fact he sold us our first car--that was after Jake came out of service--we had a little Chevrolet before he went into service and we sold it.  When he came Alice D. Abernethy                               7 out of the army he bought Mr. Jordan&#x27;s 1940 Chrysler.  I remember that very well because we were so tickled to get a car again.  Of course he sold us that land very reasonably--for our house. BB:  When you built the house did you borrow money from him? AA:  No, we got a G. I. Loan.  A good deal--4 1/2 % interest. BB:  I&#x27;ve been asking this question Alice--Sellers was not known to nay the highest wages and salaries.  Why did key employees like Jake stay on? AA:  I guess because he started out there and just saw no point in leaving.  Speaking of that, I&#x27;ll say this:  That was the only complaint I had about Mr. JOrdan where my dad was concerned.  I never did feel that he was paid what he was worth.  It seemed that the mill employees were kept too low, I felt--with all the work daddy did; the hours he spent---he never was naid enough. BB:  Sellers&#x27; group of mills was not in the forefront of wages--how they compared with mills who made similar yarns in the Gastonia-Belmont area, I don&#x27;t know.  They were our competition. You, of course, knew employees in the village; what did they say in particular about Everett Jordan? AA:  The biggest complaint I heard was being underpaid, and the poor housing conditions.  The village housing was pretty poor.  I heard someone reminiscing about the old days not too long ago--they were talking about the snow coming through the walls and beaded ceiling--right on through the roof.  They said they would almost freeze to death in cold weather.  Those houses had no sub-flooring--they were just thrown together, but in later years they did underpin the houses with tin as you know.  I can remember the first little four room house Jake and I had.  We tried to imnrove it--I remember Alice D. Abernethy                               8 going into the bathroom one cold day and the lavatory had frozen and just popped right off the wall.  People were constantly having to thaw out frozen pipes, and replace pipes back then--that was in the &quot;40&#x27;s. BB:  What year were you married? AA:  &#x27;38.  I was seventeen and Jake was almost eighteen.  He would be 63 if he had lived. BB:  Let&#x27;s assume I am someone who had never met Everett Jordan--describe him to me as a person. AA:  Well, I think I was a little in awe of him, because he seemed to be such a powerful figure, and I was aware that he owned everything in Saxanahaw, and that what he said was the law. [laughs]  I can&#x27;t say that I was ever real comfortable around him.  Now I was with Mrs. Jordan, but I was always ill at ease around Mr. Jordan.  That was due to my insecurity I suppose--! can&#x27;t explain it I was just never real comfortable around him. BB:  Was it his personality or his position, you think? AA:  I think it was both, because I didn&#x27;t think he was the easiest person to get to know.  Even back before he became senator, he seemed just so in control of eveything--! guess I just had an inferiority complex when it came to being around him.  We used to go to football games and we&#x27;d come back to his house after the game, and I would be very uncomfortable.  I think he was a powerful man; he was a hard worker that&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;m sure that was my fault--not his--the way I felt about him. BB:  Would your daddy have shared the same feelings you had? AA:  He might have to a degree, but not the way I did.  He could talk to Mr. Jordan about anything.  Especially with his work--I guess he just felt like he could talk about anything.  To be with him Alice D. Abernethy                                 9 socially, I didn&#x27;t feel that I was on his level at all. BB:  How about other employees in the village, how did they feel? AA:  I think a lot of them felt the same way.  You aren&#x27;t going to quote me in this book are you?  [Ben turns off recorder] .......you resented him to a degree. AA:  Yes I did--because of dad.  He was good to dad in many ways, but I still resented his being underpaid and overworked.  I guess that&#x27;s something I had as long as they both lived.  I just felt like that he should have been treated better--and you know they had no retirement system. BB:  They had one but it did not pay good benefits. AA:  [Laughs]  I would consider that no retirement system.......he worked such long hours and he was in so many dangerous situations.  I remember he fell from the top story one time and broke his shoulder. He fell down on some boxes and I guess they broke his fall, but he had a broken shoulder and he went to the hospital and they put a cast on him and he went right on back to work.  And he was involved with electrical things so many times.  I can remember when he would come in contact with a live wire and get knocked down or burned or something, and he just went right on back to work--and spending night after night working on that engine--not getting any sleep.  When they had the power house he would have to go out and see that those racks were clean and things done up there at the dam.  It looked so dangerous to me, and I just knew, as a child, that my dad would be killed there.  I can remember living with this thought, and I always wanted him to leave. BB:  Did he ever discuss leaving? AA:  Yes, in fact he accented a job one time and then backed out because he decided that he didn&#x27;t want to leave. Alice D. Abernethy                                 10 BB:  Did he decide to leave because of pay, extra work or what? AA:  I don&#x27;t remember that; I was very small, but I remember I was thrilled to death because we were moving to Graham.  This must have been just a few years after Mr. Jordan came there.  These people from a plant in Graham came and offered dad a job. BB:  Did your daddy ever go to Mr. Jordan and ask him for a wage increase? AA:  I don&#x27;t know if he did or not. BB:  Did your dad ever complain at home about-- AA:  No.  Daddy was not a complainer.  I think he knew he was underpaid but as I said before, I think his lack of education held him back.  You see he didn&#x27;t even finish grammar school, but like you said-he had this--I always called it a gift.  He could read blue-prints; he could do anything like that. BB AA BB Do you think he had a photographic memory? I think so. I&#x27;ve heard people say that he could be shown or told something and he could remember it. AA:  Right.  He could. BB:  He was a very good matured man and he had a sense of humor too. AA:  Yes he was very good matured; I have fond memories of him as a father. BB:  What are your memories of Saxapahaw now that you have been away awhile? Are glad you are away?  How do you feel toward Saxanahaw? AA:  I still like to go back occasionally to the churches and certain things they have.  I guess I&#x27;ll always remember that as home, but yes, I&#x27;m glad to be away.  I was glad the day I moved and I haven&#x27;t been sorry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is Ben Bulla talking to PAUL MORROW, JR., nephew of Charles V. Sellars. This is Sunday afternoon, April 11, 1983 at my home.  We will be discussing Charlie Sellars and also Everett Jordan.  Paul knew both men as a youngster and also during his adult years.  Paul lives in Burlington, and his father&#x27;s sister was the wife of Charles V. Sellars. Paul:  ........in the wintertime or late fall, Rose Ann got lost, and Mrs. Jordan was living up on Front Street right across from the old Burke Funeral Homeshe was just two doors down below us.  Rose Ann decided she wanted to go home so she started walking to Saxapahaw.  Lord! Katherine was all upset, and old Mrs. JOrdan, she called down--old man Sellars never did have a telephone up in his store, so if you wanted to call him you had to call Foster Shoe Store which was below him on the first floor, and they would holler up the stairs--so Mrs. Jordan called for them to get Charlie to the phone.  She said, &quot;Charlie you go find Rose Ann!&quot;  She was that type lady you know. BB:  That was Everett&#x27;s mother?  Where did she live? PM:  Yes.  She lived up in the 400 block on the left.  Two doors down from where we lived.  The Bason sisters lived next to us.  That&#x27;s when Br./^i/ Jordan had retired and they decided to move to Burlington.  He didn&#x27;t live there very long--he died not too long after they moved in.  She stayed there a good while--she and Charlie were in a bad automobile accident down somewhere below Mebane--they were going to Durham on old 70.  She was hurt pretty badly and she never did get over it.  I think it hurt her eyes. That was after her husband died.  Charlie was staying in Durham--! don&#x27;t know how the accident happened?-I think some fellow came toward them and Charlie took off across the field and somehow the car hit them anyway and she was badly injured.  She never got over it--she couldn&#x27;t see wellthat was back in the early &#x27;30&#x27;s I guess. BB:  That was Annie Sellars Jordan?  Can you tell me anything more about her? PM:  Well I wasn&#x27;t around her that much. BB:  Was she very stern? PM:  Yeah I would consider her very stern--she was always pleasant to us. But you could tell by her mannerisms--well all the Sellars men were gruff except Mr. Fred.  Now I never saw him when he was mad, but old Uncle Charlie was real gruff--&quot;What you doing down there?&quot;  We used to develop pictures up there and I&#x27;d be standing up front looking out the window while they dried--he used to call me Junior all the time and when I was sort of working for him he called me PaulHe would be sitting at his desk and I&#x27;d be looking out the window and he would say, &quot;Paul, I&#x27;m not paying you to stand around here looking out the window!&quot;  He scared the daylights out of me.  Ever since then I always stayed busyeven if we were not busy I&#x27;d find something to do. BB:  He was a pretty wealthy man.  What did Charlie Sellars do with all his money? PM:  I think he was just thrifty and he was a pretty shrewd businessman too he could make a little dealhe didn&#x27;t try to get it all at one time. He just made a little now and then, and I guess he must have inherited some from his father, I don&#x27;t know how much.  He had the first Ford agency hereI think Atwaterfs got it after he gave it up.  He told me one time he got away from them because he would always find a draft on the door when he would come in to work.  He had to pay for the automobiles before they would unload them.  FOB or COD or whatever--always a draft when he had a load of Model-Ts  coming.  Of course that was back when Ford was just beginning. BB:  Did you say he dealt directly with Henry Ford? PM:  Yeah, that&#x27;s what he told mer-I never did see any papers, but--then he was an Essex dealer, Hudson, Buick; I think he sold Dodges.  George Clapp ran his garagethere on Front street across from City Hall.  That&#x27;s where his garage was.  His art store was up there on Main Street, second floor.                                                                                                                     v w- -3- BB:  But he never did call it a dealership he just called it C. V. Sellars Art Store. PM:  Yeah.  He sold refrigerators--somebody was kidding him, said he would get an agency for a certain make of cars and he would sell all his brothers one then he would get out of that agency before they wanted to trade one in. Then he would get in another line.  He didn&#x27;t fool with the mechanics or anythingold George Clapp did most of that?-worked down at the garage Sellars owned the buildingthat&#x27;s where his garage and dealership. BB:  Did you say he had the first Westinghouse Radio PM:  Yes he had the first Westinghouse Radio dealership in the South. He must have just saved it because he didn&#x27;t spend any money at all. He wore his shoes--you could see his sox through the top.  He&#x27;d have a pair for Sundays and one for every day.  When they just got so he could not wear them anymore he&#x27;d buy a new pair--he&#x27;d wear them for years and years.  Cut his own hair.  Changed the &quot;a&quot; in Sellars to &quot;e&quot; said it did not take as much ink to write &quot;e&quot; as it did to write an &quot;a&quot; and he was real serious about that too.  He believed in saving everything.  He wouldn&#x27;t throw a thing away.  That shop looked just like a junk shop all over. [end of tape] PM:  I know there used to be a barber shop up on Main street--Mr. Carl Heritage owned it--estimating how long they had been in business.  Old Man Heritage said his was a little older than Charlie&#x27;s businesssaid he had the first electrical wiring in a business downtown and Uncle Charlie had the second.  They had the double wires strung along the ceiling you know.  That was there until 1950.  Heritage said, &quot;Old man Charlie has been in my barber shop one time.  That was when they had a family reunion-Mr. Fred was here, and Mr. John was here and all the brothers up there getting hair-cuts.  Charlie came in and got a shoe shine for 5f and he didn&#x27;t even tip the shoe-shine boythat old colored boythink his name was Ed Walker--but he was just that way.  But you go  out on a trip with him he&#x27;d go first class.  I&#x27;d drive him sometimes--we&#x27;d stay at the best hotels.  If somebody wanted to stop for a drink he&#x27;d get an icecream sodawhere we would buy a nickel cokeHe&#x27;d say, &quot;come on, get a soda&quot; --but that cost 15 or a banana split was 25f.  But he saved his money and he was a good business man. BB:  Did he ever get involved in real estate? PM:  Noftoo much, I think he loaned people money and if they were not able to pay him back he would have to reposses it, so he got some property he may have bought some.  So far as I know he just had his home place and he had a lot back there on Davis street where the Goodyear place is now right next to Northwestern Bank, and he had a house out on James Street-then the whole family together had the place at Montreat.  I think the boys built that--Mr. Ernest and Walter, Tom and Charlie--Mr. Ben, MaryRuth and Dorothy&#x27;s father, they had a big house further up the side the hill in that same part of MontreatI think they still have it. BB:  Can you tell me the order that B. A. Sellars&#x27; sons camewas Charlie the oldest? PM:  No I don&#x27;t think so.  I think Mr. Ben was the oldest son, I think Mary was the oldest--Mary Sellars Walker--Annie may have been next.  I just don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;ll have to ask Dorothy. BB:  How many was there in the family? PM:  Let&#x27;s see--Mary,&#x27;(Annie, fETiza, Flora, Ben, Ernest, Charlie, Walter and John.  FredI believe that&#x27;s all. BB:  Did you ever see Dr. SEllars? PM:  No.  I remember his wife a little bitFruzannah is the way I saw it spelled.  Fruzannah Kime Sellars. -5-BB:  She came from the Kimesville area you think? PM:  Evidently, I know they are related to the &quot;Jerdens&quot; which is spelled Jordan, but I&#x27;ve forgotten what the connection was.  Mike might could tell you. BB:  You knew Rev. H. H. Jordan and his wife Annie--tell me something about herAnnie Sellars Jordan--Everett Jordan&#x27;s mother. PM:  Well as I said awhile ago I always pictured her as being a real stern, strict lady--although she was always real pleasant when I was around.  She was sort of on the plump side, about five feet, two or three inchesa little chubby looking.  She had grey hair when I knew her.  I think I gave that picture of the whole family that Charlie had to Mr. Walter, but I don&#x27;t know who might have it now. BB:  Who were Walter&#x27;s children? PM:  Bailey Sellars, David Sellars and Elizabeth, she married a Farmer in Greensboro.  David and Elizabeth is still living.  David works  for Burlington Mills as a Chemist.  Bailey&#x27;s daughter is named Betty, they called her Betty Bailey SEllars.  Mr. Walter&#x27;s wife was Lila Bailey and Bailey was named after his mothers family.  I don&#x27;t know whether David had any children or not.  I just lost track of everything when WWII came along.  When I came back everybody was grown upnew people in towneverything was changed. BB:  I&#x27;ve heard that Everett Jordan was Charlie&#x27;s favorite nephew--I wonder why that was true. PM:  Well I don&#x27;t know.  When Everett was a boy his family was moving everywhere--I guess he just must have taken a liking to him just like he did mev-because I&#x27;m not related to him, but I went up there one time when I was still in high school and applied for a job.  My aunt told me that Bill Stancil, who had been working for him for about 25 or 30 years had decided to go into the beauty businessbeauty shop.  He and his wife had Stancil&#x27;s Beauty Shop, so my aunt told me to see Charlie about a job. - 6 -It was 1931 and I was a Junior in high school when I started working for him.  I&#x27;d go up there and sweep every morning and then I&#x27;d go to school and come back and work the rest of the afternoon.  One day I got the offer of a job at the old King Cotton Mill and when I told Charlie about it he says, &quot;Oh you better not go, you can&#x27;t make any money working for anybody else.&quot;  So I just stayed on with him.  He&#x27;s always real good to me  I think he paid me $5 a week while I was in school and $12 a week when I worked a full day during the summer.  I finally made it up to $100 a month before he died. BB:  You were a clerk in his shop?  Who made the frames? PM:  Yes I did all of that--everything else.  Sold the shotgun shells, guns, wallpaper, sporting goods, picture frames, photography?-he sort of got out of photography when the state required you to have a license. BB:  He made pictures of people before then? PM:  Oh yes.  All these old pictures you see around town you see are ones that he made.  He had one of these big portrait cameras; he had a regular studio with a skylightand he made some good pictures toostill not faded. BB:  What would you charge for one of those big pictures? PM:  Oh $2 or $3 dollars; probably a $1 for a 9 X 12.  Frames were cheap. Great big frame $2.50.  Solid walnut. BB:  What was that about having board meetings in his art shop? PM:  YeahWhen Sellers Mfg. would have its board meeting I would bring out these old shell boxes for them to sit onand that old rickety photo studio wicker furniture--then if they would have a meeting during the busy Christmas season he would have me stand out there to keep the customers out during the meeting. BB:  Who was on the board then? PM:  Seems like Mr. Ernest and Mr. W. H. May, Mr. Walter Williams and I believe John Shoffner, Walter Sellars and of course Everett was there, he was the secretary.--but they would just have a formal meeting up there-Uncle Charlie presided; he was president I guess as long as he lived. BB:  When Charlie died he chose Everett as the executor of his estate; there again indicating he was his favorite nephew. one PM:  Well it looked like Everett was the only/that took interest in him. I would take them down there just about every Sunday for dinner.  I had to drive for the old folks--!&#x27;d rather have been out with people my own age but my parents said it was my duty to help them out.  I didn&#x27;t mind doing it, I loved to drive and he had that fancy Chrysler.  I&#x27;d just sit on the porch and read the paper or something--Ben Everett was too small to want to play with meso I&#x27;d just sit there after dinner while they&#x27;d go take a nap--then they&#x27;d make a tour of the mill.  Around 5:30 or 6:00 o&#x27;clock Charlie would say, &quot;Well it&#x27;s time to go home.&quot; And Everett would say, &quot;We&#x27;ll be up there in a little bit.&quot; They would come up to Burlington to eat supper on Sunday night.with Charlie.  He lived up there on Front Streetwhere Dr. Huff&#x27;s office is now.  He built that house in 1922 designed it himself.  I believe it was Mr. Luke Sharpe and Worth Bryan that were the contractors.  The Walker home was next door and the Old Sellars home was down on the corner of Front and Church.  Charlie bought this little narrow:: lot from the Walkers; about a 50&#x27; frontage--house right on the line.  Somebody asked him why he built such a nice house on that small lot and he said, &quot;Well it suits me all right.&quot; He finally had to buy a little house next door--somehow or other in getting deeds transferred they found that some of Uncle Charlie&#x27;s wall was encroaching on the lot next door. named BB:  After Charlie died, and Everett Jordan was/executor, I heard that Mrs. Sellarswas unhappy about him being the executor--that he wouldn&#x27;t give her what she wanted or something-- PM:  No I don&#x27;t think that was it.  I think Uncle Charlie had the will written--now this was just before I went into the army and as well as I remember--I think it concerned the home place more than anything else because she contributed a lot of money herself when they built it.  She was right well off herself.  I think the way he had it in his will it was to be her home as long as she lived then it would go to Everett when she died.  Some doctor in Burlington told her she should contest itI drove her to Charlotte one time to some lawyer up there; he was working on it.  She got it changed so that when she died she left it to me.  I didn&#x27;t have nothing to do with it.  I was surprised as anything when she died--I was already in the army then because he died in September of &#x27;41 and I left for the army in November of &#x27;41 and I didn&#x27;t know all that was happening until she died in 1943.  I came home on emergency furlough when she died.  Yes she left it to me and I sold it to Dr. Huff. BB:  I knew she was unhappy about it but I didn&#x27;t know the details. PM:  Well that&#x27;s the only thing I can think,,of.&quot; BB:  Well she had a point there. PM:  I think she told me one time that she spent right much money on it herself--of course I was so small when they built the place.  They were still living at the old Dr. B. A. Sellars home there on the corner.  We&#x27;d go up there to visit them--and of course she was my favorite aunt--she was a lot of fun and she was always interested in Carter and me both. When we&#x27;d go up to visit themI was just a little bitty fellowI&#x27;d say, &#x27;Annie Morrow let&#x27;s go to see the new house&quot; it was just a couple of doors up I saw it built from the foundation on up &#x27;til it was finished.  Of course I didn&#x27;t expect anything like that to happen; the way Charlie had his will set up Everett was supposed to get it, and I was real surprised to find I was the beneficiary of her will.  I lived there for several years.  Now -9- she had it in her will that it was to be the home of my other aunt, Mrs. Glenn, as long as she lived.  When I got out of service we fixed up a little apartment in the house with her.  She was old and it didn&#x27;t bother her and she didn&#x27;t bother us.  I lived down there until 1952 then I bought a place over on Parkview Drive near Williams High School where I live now. BB:  They say that Everett was a great storyteller.  Was Charlie a storyteller? PM:  Yeah, he could tell some good ones.  He sent Everett out to Detroit one time to pick up an automobilehe was a dealer I think he would save freight and get a free trip for what you would save in paying freight, so he got old George Clapp to take Everett out there and he told George to show Everett how to have a good time--they were going to pass through some big cities [laughs].  He told me that a many a timeoh he was always telling about things that happened when he was a kid--but old Everett was a pretty good conversationalist himself.  There was a moving picture one time called &quot;The Big Parade&quot; all about WWICharlie Jordan said Everett could tell some big tales about WWI too,about all he did and everything, but he couldn&#x27;t call it&quot;The Big Parade&quot; he&#x27;d have to call it &quot;The Big Lie He could talk all right--and everybody liked him.&quot;&quot;* I don&#x27;t know anybody that didn&#x27;t like him--in the business community. BB:  Do you remember any stories that Everett Jordan told? PM:  No right now I can&#x27;tI know I&#x27;d sit there and laugh until I&#x27;d cry. As I said he&#x27;d come up there and eat supper on Sunday night... and Everett would come up to the Rotary meeting on Monday night then he would come by the house to see Uncle Charlie after the meeting and stay until about 9 o&#x27;clock then he&#x27;d drive on back down to Saxapahaw.  They stayed in close contact all the time. -10- BB:  When they built the dam were you on the scene then? PM:  Yes I was down there a lot on Sunday&#x27;s; I took most of those snapshots. ................ [tape not clear] ....sitting on the porch there at Saxapahaw.....fire in the mill... Everett was down there....see for himself. BB:  In their conversations around the dinner table, Paul, what did they talk about? PM: When I was there, I just remember small talk mostlyfamily talk the children were smallJenny was the maid and Ralph Miller worked for them--he drove Ben and Rose Ann to town to school. BB:  How would you describe the Sellars family in general, Paul? Were there any characteristics or traits that stand out? PM:  Well I&#x27;d say they were very frugal; I&#x27;d say they were very demanding they&#x27;d tell you to do something--the whole family seemed to be that way I mean you were their servant.  That&#x27;s the impression I always got--of course Uncle Charlie wasn&#x27;t that way around me but I have seen him talk to other people that way.. Or for instance, &quot;I&#x27;ll pay you 15f an hour&quot;--if you asked somebody to do a job for you, you&#x27;d ask him how much he was going to charge youwell Uncle Charlie would say, &quot;I&#x27;ll pay you 15&lt;j: an hour.&quot;  But they were always highly respected and honest as daylight.  They paid their bills before the ink got dry on the statements.  I don&#x27;t know whether this is so or not, but I always heard that Uncle Charlie paid the B. A. Sellars  Store&#x27;s invoices for them and his commission was the discount. You know if you pay within 10 days you get a discount--well that would be his commission for paying the bills for them for a while.  I know one time a case of shoes came up there from U. S. Rubber Co. addressed to C. V. Sellars.  We hadn&#x27;t ordered any shoes--they belonged across the street at B. A. Sellars.  C. V. had sent the check to pay for the merchandise -11- in the past and evidently they thought he was supposed to get the shipment.  So that&#x27;s another reason I think that&#x27;s true that he paid the bills for them for the discount.  They must have had a rough time there at one time or another.  But Old Man Sellars never would have a telephone up there; never would have a post office box; he got his mail over at the big store.  He&#x27;d go every morning pick up his mailhe got the New York Herald Tribune--never had a post office box. BB:  That paper he got; was that a business paper? PM:  No that was just like the New York Times only they went broke.  It was a coupetitorwiti the N Y Times.  They used to have the best funny papers  That rotogravure section--that brown picture section-boy that was something to see those in the New York Herald Tribune.  That&#x27;s a Republican paper I believe.  It&#x27;s just the opposite view of the New York Times. BB:  You say he was frugal--how about his eating at home? PM:  Oh law!  They ate like kings and queens.  Annie was a great cook and she loved to eat.  I&#x27;ve heard my father say that Annie must have &#x27;brought Charlie out&#x27; because his mother must have been very frugal--that&#x27;s where they got that trait from.  So when Uncle Charlie got married I guess he did eat better.  I&#x27;ve heard my daddy say, &quot;Annie had brought Charlie out; he don&#x27;t look as peaked or as yellow as he used to.&quot;  I was only 3 years old when they got marriedthey said it was in July and they spent their honeymoon up in Montreat with the rest of the family.  He was about 48 when they got married.  Aunt Annie was about the same age. BB:  What did she do before she got married? PM:  You&#x27;ve heard of the Bason G Bason store? Well it used to be Morrow G Bason.  When she got married she sold out to one of the Bason sisters that was a ladies millinery store. BB:  Where was Charlie&#x27;s Art Shop located? -12- PM:  It was on Main Street across from where Sellars* Department Store is now.  That old steel staircase xxxxxixx that went up to his shop is still being used in that building.  Well it&#x27;s empty now, but a furniture store was in there last, or maybe a restaurant. BB:  Was B. A. Sellars Department store always where it is now? PM:  No it was at one time on Front Street, but that was a long time before I came along, then they moved around where they are now, I forget what year. BB:  Can you think of anything else about Charlie Sellars that stands out in your mind that we haven&#x27;t already discussed? PM:  He was on the board of directors of the First National Bank when it failed during the depression.  They reorganized and he and Mr. R. M. Whitehead, the hosiery man, put up the moneyor I know Uncle Charlie would match anybody--he&#x27;d put the- same amount to reorganize which was later the National Bank of Burlington.  That&#x27;s when Mr. Blakey came here, he was the bank examiner or had charge of the whole liquidation or something.  They made him president.  He was an uncle of Herman Gibson who finally married Mary Ruth Sellars. Charlie was quite civic minded as far as business was concerned, but he didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the social life, especially after I knew him.  Bridge playing was a waste of time; smoking was a waste of money;  anything that was good times was a waste of money, yet he would take off and go fishinghe was real conservative, but if he would go off on a trip somewhere he would go first class. BB:  He was a teetotaler wasn&#x27;t he? PM:  Yeah, law yes.  I remember one time up at Montreat there was a concert of the North Carolina Symphony, it might have been it&#x27;s first season.  They had it in the big Anderson Auditorium and we all went. -13- The concert was real good--Uncle Charlie said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to contribute a dad gum thing--one of the lady artists was in the back smoking.&quot; [laughs] He was that type of fellow you know. One time back in the early 30&#x27;s they thought about bringing Sunday movies into Burlington.  The Board of Aldermen did pass a resolution to that effectthey had them everywhere else almost.  So Uncle Charlie wrote every member of the Board of Aldermen a penny postcard (he never wrote a letter just used a penny postcard--he could write whole epistle on one card)--he wrote every Alderman to, &quot;come see jne.&quot; Several came up there and he just chewed them out for letting Sunday movies come to Burlington. And they recinded that motion.  It was after Charlie died that they finally showed movies on Sunday in Burlington--that was during the war. He&#x27;d do things like thatreal civic minded.  He was real firm in his beliefs. BB:  Well both families, apparently, were prominentthe Sellars and the a     Jordans.  C. V. went to church, but they say Fred never went to church. /  PM:  I didn&#x27;t know him except when he came to Burlington to visit.  He was one of these &quot;hail fellow well met&quot; men you know.  I&#x27;d call him the &quot;playboy&quot; brother.  He was more liberal thinking than the rest of them I think. Boy when he came to town they would just have a reunion.  They would have it at Charlie&#x27;s because Aunt Annie always fed them good.  Law, they would tell some of the wildest tales--I&#x27;d just sit there dying laughing at those old men--I was just a kid, but I would sit around and enjoy laughing at tall \  them.  My father would egg them on to get them to tell all those/tales. I didn&#x27;t know Fred too well.  Now his wife was a quiet lady; I think she was part Indian.  Her name was LelaI think she&#x27;s buried over at Pine Hill Cemetery--Fred is--Miss Marie is.  She died not too long ago.  She taught here two years and my mother boarded her then.  She was real quiet and I was real surprised that she got married because she had never dated anybody that I know of.  She was real attractive young lady.  I think she married a doctor out in Kansasa VanDeventer.  I met him one time. I remember old man Fred says, &quot;I&#x27;m getting old I had to get somebody to give me some free prescriptions.&quot; BB:  You said earlier that Charlie also, would not go to an optometrist, that he bought his glasses at the dime store.  Maybe that&#x27;s where Everett Jordan got his ideas. PM:  I thought Everett always went first class. BB:  No, he bought his glasses at the dime store.  Now in later years he might have got them from the doctor. PM:  I would drive Aunt Annie and Uncle Charlie to Montreat and Everett and Mrs. Jordan would come up there to stay with them.  Everett would have to come back on Sunday to go to work Monday.  So I would bum a ride home with him.  One Sunday evening we were going home and when we got to Hickory Everett said, &quot;Paul, Jr. do you want a steak?&quot;  I&#x27;d never eaten a broiled steak in my lifeI told him yeah.  We stopped in a little restaurant in down-town Hickory an ordered a broiled steak.  The bill was thick 75&lt;.  I thought that was awfully high inch and a qtr./steak.  I vas worried about paying for it and Everett said, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll take care of it.&quot;  He was always doing things like that.  He&#x27;d do anything for anybody.  He drove Uncle Charlie and Aunt Annie out to Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1933.  I think they went to Florida around 1939 or 40.  As well as I remember they cut that trip shortCharlie was getting feeble.  When they went to Chicago they met Mr. Fred there at the Fair.  Everett had a 1933 Chrysler and they took off one Sunday afternoon and drove out there.  Uncle Charlie kept a record in a little book of how much was spent&#x27;--how much they tipped each waitress--how much gas they bought--he probably paid for all  -15- of it, I&#x27;m not sure about that, but anytime he went anywhere he went first class, but he kept a record of it. BB:  Why did he keep a record do you think? PM:  I don&#x27;t know.  He gave me a trip to the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1934. I didn&#x27;t want to go by myself so I took my brother with me.  Charlie said, &quot;Now Paul, I want you to keep an accurate record of everything you do the time you arrive in a town and the time you leave a town and all.&quot; And I did.  But he wanted me to go.  Said I could learn more going to the World&#x27;s Fair than I could going to college. BB:  When you came back did he look over your records? PM:  Yeah, he looked them over.  My brother still kids me about this before we left my aunt gave me a little pink purse, a cloth purse like the ladies used, she wanted me to put my money in it and pin it to my underwear [Laughs].  She was afraid I was going to get robbed out there in Chicago and wouldn&#x27;t have any money to get home. Let me tell you another one:  I was brought up real strict too.  My mother and father were real _______Presbyterian.  When we got out there I said, &quot;Carl, let&#x27;s go see a hoochie koochie show.&quot;  We never had seen one.  &quot;Nobody out here knows us and we might learn something.&quot;  So we did, and when we came out of that little theatre the first person we saw was Mrs. Lawson Dick, you know, the automobile dealer&#x27;s wife.  She said, &quot;Now I know why y&#x27;all are in there, but I&#x27;m not going to say a word to your mother about it.&quot;  She never did.  I think she and her husband had started to Detroit to get a car and they just made a detour through Chicago.  He was a real popular auto dealer here too.  His garage was there where the Times News is.  Gate City Motors. BB:  As far as Everett Jordan goes, what did people in Burlington think about him Paul? -16 PM:  Well he was well liked.  He was real civic minded; he helped organize the hospital and when the bank reopened he was one of the leading sellers of stock to reorganize the bank.  He was into everything  just like the young business men are now.  He headed the Heart Fund Drive one year;  T. B.real civic minded all these projects going to Washington a lot of times for the Chamber of Commerce.  One time he drove Mr. John Coble, he was a Coca-Cola bottler distributor, they went to Washington for something or other and Everett drove Mr. Coble&#x27;s Packard. Everett came back and told that the next time they went he was going to drive his car, said, &quot;Those damn Packard&#x27;s, the headlights aren&#x27;t any good, I couldn&#x27;t see a thing.&quot; Of course the main thing he just worked so hard down at that mill to get it going, because they had a hard time there at first. You&#x27;ve heard of Tiny Cole&#x27;s Dairy Lunch up there on Spring Street? I went in on day for lunch and Everett was sitting up at the counter eating and I went up and sat down beside him and said, &quot;Lawwww Everett! Uncle Charlie sure would be proud of you being a Senator now.&quot;  Old Everett said, &quot;The hell he would--he&#x27;d say I ought to be out selling yarn!&quot; And that&#x27;s about right. BB:  I got the impression that Everett was a little bit--! wouldn&#x27;t say he stood in awe of Charlie, but he had a lot of respect for him and tried to obey or carry out his wishes. PM:  Yes, I think he did.  They probably talked a lot when I wasn&#x27;t around. I remember onetime Henry was telling Charlie about something that Everett had done that someone on the board did not approve of. One time I went to Charlotte with Everett and we stopped at Frank Shannonhouse [end of tape - not clear] .....started to Montreat.... .....The Sellars&#x27; family been going to Montreat a long time-Charlie and -17- Annie got married in 1918 and they were going before then. I remember the first time I saw Katherine Jordan; she was a real thin brunette--Ben was in a little basket or crib.  It was at Uncle Charlie&#x27;s.  I was just a teenager when they came--14 maybe. BB:  Do you remember your first trip to Saxapahaw? PM:  Oh yes.  My father used to go down there in a Model-T when the Williamson&#x27;s had it.  There was a covered bridge across Alamance Creek we had some kinfolks lived on Bethlehem Church Road.  We&#x27;d go to the Bethlehem Church for home comingit was a little old frame building a little bigger than your shop there.   We&#x27;d come back through Saxapahaw to go home; there wasn&#x27;t any &quot;54&quot; then. Well that&#x27;s about all I can think of. BB;  Thank you Paul, very much.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed this.</dc:description>

<dc:description>G- 33 3 Southern Oral History Program North Carolina Politics Int. with James G. Martin 2/6/98 Int. by Jack D. Fleer Audio cassette 1 of 3 Voice:             Interview with Governor James G. Martin of North Carolina for Wake Forest University and the Southern Oral History Program at Chapel Hill. It is part of a series of interviews with North Carolina&#x27;s living former governors. The interview was conducted February 6, 1998, on the campus of Wake Forest University in the Provost Conference room in Reynolda Hall. The interviewer is Dr. Jack D. Fleer, Department of Politics, Wake Forest University. Tape #2-6-98-JGM. Martin:           Let me say by introduction that from my political experience which is about 26 years as County Commissioner, a member of the U.S. Congress, Governor of North Carolina and what I&#x27;ve not only experienced but have observed being governor of a state is the best job in politics in the United States. Fleer:              I wanted to ask you about that. I know you had mentioned- Martin:           No question there&#x27;s exhilaration of being elected to anything. There&#x27;s abject despair at being defeated for anything. Each of these jobs has its high moments and overall I would say that I have enjoyed my political career, certainly on balance. There have been bad days. That was true when I was teaching chemistry. I had, at Davidson College, days that weren&#x27;t as good as others and so that&#x27;s true in each of these fields of government and they all had their unique challenges. Being a legislator is much different. It&#x27;s more like a committee assignment while being governor is an executive position with really vast resources of support. I often think of that in terms of the staff and the cabinet secretaries and the people who are devoted to carrying out the political agenda that was developed during the campaign and since, but I also think in terms of the public at large. My wife and I have frequently commented to people about the most satisfying surprise about being governor was the springing up of good will from people all over the state. It didn&#x27;t matter whether they voted for us or didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t matter whether they even knew who we were. If it was the governor of North Carolina ... unnamed. 1 So the institution is very respected. The institution is highly respected. The office is highly respected. That&#x27;s a great credit and tribute to all of those who have filled it because they haven&#x27;t stained it beyond repair. Certainly there have been some highs and lows in the governor&#x27;s office and it&#x27;s subject to a political battleground and that tends to cause wounds. But unlike any other office, the people are so genuinely respectful and friendly toward the occupant of that office. So as we would travel across the state even our political adversaries were always doing everything they could to make us comfortable, tend to convenience and efficiency of movement and so forth. A very political sheriff from the other party does not hesitate to help a governor of a state, no matter who it is. Fleer:              So it obviously contributed to lessening whatever weight of responsibility, didn&#x27;t it? Martin:           It really did. It invigorates you. It carries you through the low moments. It makes you excited about opportunities to do things. Of course, there are things that you can achieve. There are many things for any governor, not only myself and Jim Holshouser who were Republicans with Democratic legislature. But Democrat governors with a Democrat legislature have had this same experience. The legislature has its own internal agendas and jurisdiction and attitudes about things. Therefore any governor has a great challenge to achieve legislative victories regardless of how that circumstance works out. But there&#x27;s also going to be times when for any governor there are great disappointments because the legislature isn&#x27;t going to do what the governor wants. Nevertheless you&#x27;ve got to keep trying. You&#x27;ve got the responsibility under the constitution. You also have a sort of a bully pulpit because there&#x27;s very good media attention to any sneeze the governor might have. Therefore that&#x27;s an advantage and you use it for the benefit of things you&#x27;re committed to, things that your team has developed and you try to advance on a number of fronts. We&#x27;ll get back to your questions in a moment. I think in this overview its worth noting that while a governor can address and champion many different causes, thousands, if you&#x27;re really going to have an impact, though, you need to focus on five or six.   So you&#x27;ll see in my discussions while a lot of different subjects and problems and issues that came up, the ones that I focused on were better schools, better roads, better jobs. I made that a campaign slogan and the second time around it was the theme of my first inaugural address and we picked up from there for our legislative agenda. We had other things. We had to deal with prison inadequacies. We had to deal with crises, both natural disasters and hostage situations, corporations moving out of the state as well as those we were recruiting in. All those kinds of things, death penalty, clemency issues are an enormous spiritual and intellectual burden on a governor. But the ones you have the most impact on, and I felt I did, were schools and roads and jobs; education, transportation and vocation. Fleer: Martin: 2 Fleer:              That&#x27;s a good introduction and obviously I guess you only realize the respect and the stature in a sense of the office once you&#x27;ve got into it. Martin:           How very true. Fleer:              So let&#x27;s begin a little bit earlier in your career. When did you begin thinking about becoming involved in politics? Martin:           Setting aside the school politics and the faculty politics, we&#x27;re talking about electoral partisan politics. I became interested in participating in that about my second year as an assistant professor of chemistry at Davidson. That would have been about 1961-62. We had an election coming up in 1964. There were the off elections in 1962 and I registered as a Republican not for philosophical reasons. Today I think that&#x27;s more typical of why people register as Republican. It has more to do with Democrat, with their balancing of philosophy. But back in the sixties most southern conservatives were Democrats and most southern Democrats were conservatives. So if it were philosophical I could just as well have joined the Democratic Party at that date. That wouldn&#x27;t work as well today. The statements aren&#x27;t true anymore and that gives clearer choices for the people and is part of the development of the two party system but that last phrase was why I registered as a Republican, not thinking I could ever have much to do with the emergence of a two party system. I joined with the minority party because I felt the south needed two party competition. As James G. Citizen there in a chemistry laboratory as a main responsibility, I would at least register with the one that needed help. One thing led to another. That was my first participation. In college I was not active in political activities. Did not really follow the elections very closely. My generation once got dubbed as the &quot;silent generation.&quot; It surprised me but I think it was certainly true in my case as a collegiate. In graduate school I began to listen to some discussions and stayed around longer for bull sessions for coffee, for seminars, for neighborhood conversations that would get into those subjects and had some idle fascination about it. It was interesting the things that people get motivated about and took so seriously. But I didn&#x27;t really take it so seriously then until I guess the 1960 election. I paid more attention and then when I got to Davidson.   See I was moving from graduate school at Princeton in 1960 to start my teaching career and was behind the curve on local elections. Wasn&#x27;t really interested. So it was about 1961 or 1962 that I began to get to be interested and because I registered as a Republican. Obviously there was no Republican club on campus. No conservative club on campus. So I helped students organize it. I was the faculty advisor to two brand new clubs by that name. Then we began to see that instead of just talking about it our precinct was rolling up huge majorities for the Democrats because they were very effectively organized and our side wasn&#x27;t. So we got students to go out and start 3 canvassing the neighborhoods. Back then the data processing system was a shoebox full of index cards. Computers only in the next couple of years became available on our campus. They&#x27;d take up a room bigger than the one we&#x27;re in. Fleer:              I worked on some of those. Martin:           You know, those old vacuum tube UNTVAC. So index cards with edges marked with a black marker in a corners so that you could sort out the ones with patterns marked. That was how we did it. We would find out who would vote for any Republican. Who, among our neighbors, had voted for Charlie Jonas? He would get beat 3-1,4-1 in that precinct. We wanted to identify those who voted for him ever. Who voted for Eisenhower? Then as we began to put all this together. We found that we could then follow-up and call those people to get them to go in to vote. What I&#x27;m showing then is that I started out as a precinct worker and we got great satisfaction in tripling our vote. We started out getting beat 6-1. Somebody would get beat 2-1. Or instead of 3-1, you know, we&#x27;d get beat 2-1. We had made quite a move on ... Fleer:              Very grass roots kind of politics at that time. Martin:           And today that precinct will elect the best candidates from both parties. To me that in itself was satisfying. That was my start in politics. Fleer:              Were your parents- I know your father was a minister in the Presbyterian church. Martin:           Yes. Fleer:              Were your parents interested in politics and expressed that to you as you were growing up in Georgia? Martin:           My parents were not involved in politics and as a Presbyterian minister that would probably have been fatal to do that. He did, I learned at the time of his death, I didn&#x27;t know this before, but as we were going through the records of the Savannah Church where he grew up, it showed that letters he had written indicated that he wanted to serve in the United States Congress and he never told me that even when I was elected. I learned this as I was leaving Congress and running for governor. So there had been an interest and a curiosity. He had wanted to go to West Point, ended up going to Davidson and that turned him toward the ministry and he never looked back. They weren&#x27;t involved with politics. Fleer:              And your mother was not involved. Martin:           No. They were both registered as Democrat because that&#x27;s what you did in those 4 days. When I was elected for Congress, they couldn&#x27;t vote for me. But they changed their registration just as a salute. Fleer:              They couldn&#x27;t vote for you because they were in South Carolina. Martin:           -South Carolina and I was in Davidson. Fleer:              Were there any political activities or experiences growing up in Savannah or that area of Georgia that made any impression-Martin:           I was born in Savannah but we moved away when I was two years old so I don&#x27;t remember it. Fleer:              So you moved to another part of South Carolina. Martin:           To Winnsboro, South Carolina. I was aware that there were such things as politics and elections. The town hall wase in the ground floor of an old town clock. A building that had a huge town clock in it. And we&#x27;d go and watch it and chalk up the results. We knew a couple of the people who were running. My football coach was a . .. That&#x27;s idle. Nothing really serious. Not in Davidson. As secretary of the intrafraternity council I was involved in a group of students acting to support bringing a Hungarian refugee to Davidson, to Charlotte. He now has a major electrical appliance business in Charlotte. I just remembered his name, Ivan______. But that was peripheral to politics. It was a huge political issue for the Hungarians and the Soviet Union back there in the late fifties but nothing really involved. Fleer:              And as you said there were no young Republican clubs or young conservative clubs at Davidson when you were a student. Martin:           There were discussion groups. There were political discussions and it was mostly Democrats which at that time would have been comfortable. It was only when I got back to Davidson teaching that I felt while I could have been very comfortable with the Democratic party, they didn&#x27;t need me. The Republican Party I viewed as a losing organization, a losing cause. Maybe that&#x27;s part of the Davidson philosophy for the underdog and winning moral victories like improving your score from being beat 6-1 to only getting beat 2-1. When our basketball team came close to Wake Forest we felt real good about that this year. Fleer:              I assume that your father, as a minister at Presbyterian church, was someone who was widely known in the community and presume that your family was well known. Were they among the, in a sense, decisionmakers of that community? I don&#x27;t know that much about Winnsboro, what size community it is or what your 5 impressions of it are. Martin:           Winnsboro has a population of about 4,000; had two dividing lines. One dividing the racial populations and when I was growing up, of course, divided school populations. If you went to your neighborhood school, then you went to the black school. Then it was called &quot;Negro.&quot; Or you went to the Mount Zion Institute which went back to the revolution. Cornwallis kept his horses in one of the- Fleer:              -which was a public school. Martin:           It was the public school there. Then there was a dividing line between Winnsboro and Winnsboro-Mills; most of which was like Kannapolis in this state was owned by the factory, the Milkes, which was U.S. Rubber company. They made tire cord, parachute fabric, nylon. All those kinds of things. Rayon. But that was a division that today in society wouldn&#x27;t be tolerated. People are freer to move. That was a part of society in those days and you grow up within it. My parents were respected and listened to, I know that. People have commented on that a lot. But not in a political way. They didn&#x27;t help recruit candidates or put up posters or talk to people about how to vote. That&#x27;s because of the nature of his job. That would not have been compatible. Fleer:              On the other hand if there were an issue of public concern in the community, would your father have been one who would be consulted or maybe even volunteer? Martin:           Yes, of course. He would be. And one of the best illustrations of that was a few years later after I had graduated from college. They had moved from Winnsboro to Columbia and he had become the executive secretary of the Presbyterian synod of South Carolina, which meant he was like Bishop. He didn&#x27;t have that title but he had that responsibility for all of the South Carolina Presbyterian Church, within the Presbyterian church U.S. which at that time was a southern branch. He, in that office, was a strong advocate for church union to combine the northern and southern Presbyterian churches which had divided over the war between the states in the nineteenth century and also which divided those black Presbyterians apart from the Presbyterian church U.S. He thought there ought to be one church and worked very hard for that and was a part of achieving and celebrating that. So that&#x27;s church politics. Secondly, he was a leader in organizing and energizing an ecumenical multi-faith, multi-racial association of clergy including Catholics and Jews. I don&#x27;t know that they had Muslim or Islamic participation at that time because probably it wasn&#x27;t far enough advanced.   That&#x27;s had a very rapid growth in recent years. But everybody who was available that they could identify participated in these including a young Catholic priest, then a monsignor, named Joseph Bernardin who later became Cardinal. Before my father&#x27;s death, he 6 predicted that Bernardin would be the first American Pope. And, of course, you know Bernardin went through the various serious and difficult accusation which was retracted but that threw him off stride in dealing with that. Whereas everybody that really knew him knew that he was an impeccable giant in his character. Yet it showed how someone for their own reasons can destroy somebody else. Maybe he wouldn&#x27;t have become Pope but he did retain his office as Cardinal because he was exonerated on that. My father was a close friend of his. I once had an opportunity to introduce Cardinal Bernardin. That&#x27;s what we call him. The news media called him Bernardin and other things but we knew him as Bernardin and introduced him at a meeting at the Knights of Columbus while I was in Asheville while I was governor. Fleer:              That&#x27;s wonderful. Martin:           And he didn&#x27;t know my connection to Arthur Martin until in introducing him I told the story and what Pop thought of him. Fleer:              So you were aware of your father&#x27;s activities in this church politics and this sort of ecumenical movement. Martin:           Yes. Fleer:               ... at the time that they were occurring. Martin:           Yes. Fleer:              What about your mother? Was she involved in any kind of public activity? Martin:           She was very actively involved with us four boys. My oldest brother was Junior, Arthur Martin. We called him Bubba and I was about a year and a month behind him. We grew up being called Bubba Jimmy. People couldn&#x27;t tell which was which. And we sang duets in the church and all that kind of thing before our voices changed. But Mom was very active with us. She was active with church activities. The young people&#x27;s groups. Active as den mother for scouts. Those kinds of things. She was not particularly active in politics. In her late years, and therefore not part of my formative stage, but in her late years, she did become more actively involved in supporting her political representatives. Maybe she learned that from me that that was all right, that was an acceptable thing to do and in organizing the retirement center where she lived and for considerable time, the Presbyterian home in Lexington, South Carolina. She became den mother to that group. She got them pretty well organized. Again, it would not be easy or direct to point to their political stature as on the other hand you would with many other political leaders. Certainly with Bob Scott&#x27;s father... Jim Hunt&#x27;s father was 7 involved in the Rock Springs local politics. Jim Holshouser&#x27;s parents were involved in Watauga County. Broyhill&#x27;s father was a giant lay leader of Republicans in western North Carolina. Fleer:              As you were growing up in South Carolina before you went to Davidson and Princeton, where you aware of any politics in South Carolina, any of the key figures? Some of whom are still prominent in- Martin:           While I was in high school? Fleer:              Yes sir. Martin:           Well, I knew who the senator was from our town. That&#x27;s what they called him. I knew a couple of people who later got elected to the state legislature. I knew the name of Strom Thurmond. A young political leader at that time. My father did get to meet Bernard Baruch who had property in South Carolina and had some connection, I think, with Rockefeller properties. I&#x27;m not sure exactly but he had gotten to know him and talked admiringly about him. There was- Fleer:              So you had some awareness of the political... Martin:           Jimmy Burns, they had met him at some things. I guess Pop was invited as a minister and maybe that reflected more political stature than I know about, come to think of it. But they did know James F. Burns and thought very highly of him. Fleer:              So this early experience- Martin:           But they weren&#x27;t involved in his politics. Fleer:              Right, -did not influence you, you feel, as far as your political development but on the other hand it also didn&#x27;t turn you off from politics, did it? There wasn&#x27;t any certain negative ... Martin:           That&#x27;s a correct statement. I was apolitical. I had no attraction to it in high school, in college, in graduate school. Only in graduate school was I beginning to even stay around long enough to listen to some discussions. Didn&#x27;t have much to add. I was a late bloomer in that respect. You&#x27;re correct in saying there was no scandal or embarrassment-Fleer:              -or cynicism Martin:           or cynicism that turned me away from it. People talk a lot about that today as being part of the atmosphere. But since becoming active as a politician, I&#x27;ve come 8 to recognize that politics has always been very combative and disparaging where people build their careers by tearing down someone else&#x27;s. That&#x27;s not new to this generation. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been. Not just in America. Fleer:              I agree. So the sort of political activity that you began as a sort of a grass roots organizer in Davidson as an assistant professor-Martin:           -With no thought of being a candidate for anything, had no interest in it. Fleer:              All you were interested in . . . could you talk a little bit about why you were interested in organizing for the conservatives and the Republican party. Is it simply that you saw them as the underdog and you thought they needed some representation? Martin:           Well, my personal philosophy was and has been conservative. I can point to some things that I think I was fairly progressive on but conservative with regard to national policy, international relations, national defense and being a defender of freedom in other countries as that&#x27;s gone from time to time. On economic policy I&#x27;ve been conservative, strong advocate for balancing the budget which never happened during the time I was in Congress but happened every time in North Carolina every year because it&#x27;s required by the constitution. That was my job, to make it happen. I had the tools to do it. But that was my philosophy and I tuned into that and endorsed that in my personal views. But again I could have done that very well at that time within the Democratic Party. Joining the Republicans only as I indicated before to help the minority party to begin to have some support. Then after I joined I saw that there was a need.    In fact, I think students asked me. They inquired, &quot;Who are the Republicans here?&quot; I think the instigator may have been a student from Ohio who came down to Davidson from a state that had a strong Republican party, couldn&#x27;t find even a faculty advisor and somebody told him that, &quot;Well, I think over in the chemistry building professor Martin over there may be.&quot; And so he came and talked with me and so we developed the first conservative club. It was more debate, to bring in speakers, to have someone who would stand up and challenge the prevailing point of view. I got active in those kinds of things because of the climate. In that community, a small college town which was predominantly liberal in its politics and absolutely overwhelmingly Democrat. Fleer:              Would you say that also about the faculty? Martin:           Yes. Of course, the faculty. There were maybe five percent of the faculty that were Republicans. They knew to keep their mouth shut. No, I can&#x27;t say that. There were a couple who spoke up and to some extent were treated as pariahs because, you know, what do they know, they&#x27;re Republicans. Something was 9 wrong with them. But I was invigorated by that. I thought somebody needed to get organized and we&#x27;d just do it. The kind of discussions that I got into in those first couple of years had to do more with local government as the best, the ideal site venue for dealing with local problems. Fleer:              Were there particular issues that you can recall that you were dealing with? Martin:           Well, at that time that was a wide-spread discussion of a growing federal government dictating to state and local government what it had to do given enough money that they couldn&#x27;t refuse and then making more and more decisions on a national central government basis. That&#x27;s still a theme today but it&#x27;s not among the sharper themes. Back at that time it was something that made sense to me. And as I got into it and began to be the person expected to speak up when others were advocating a different centralization, even advocating a socialist government structure. That was somewhat in vogue in those days. The college properly defended even those who were identified or suspected of being communists. That was apart of those days. You&#x27;re talking about early sixties. At the same time, the college administration welcomed anybody who would speak up on the other side. I was willing to and did. Because I saw and got more involved in the debate about the federal government centrally usurping the power of local governments, I had to recognize that part of that was because the local government was not doing what it needed to do for the health, welfare, opportunity of access of the citizens locally. Therefore we were losing it by default. Therefore, in 1963 I ran for town council. Fleer:              In Davidson. In the community of Davidson. Martin:           In the town of Davidson. Several members of the faculty were town commissioners and one of them had been one of my teachers, John T. Kimbraugh, mathematics professor. I didn&#x27;t ask their permission. I just said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to run.&quot; I talked with a few people about it and felt that that was something I had to do because how could I advocate local government and then abdicate. Well abdicate isn&#x27;t the right word because you do that after you get power. How could I advocate it without supporting it, without getting involved. So I filed as a candidate. Interesting thing happened. Dr. Kimbraugh saw me in the faculty lounge where we picked up our mail. Each member had a little cubicle for internal mail, picked up there. He came up beside me and had his pipe and said, &quot;See where you&#x27;re running for town council.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how you and Grover Metts and several others have served on council.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s good. I hope you realize that here in Davidson being a close knit family, we respect each other&#x27;s right to run but none of us campaign. It&#x27;s not seemly to go out and openly campaign or ask people to vote. That&#x27;s the way that we do it.&quot; I didn&#x27;t know any better. I&#x27;d been involved in 10 recruiting in the partisan campaigns. This was a non-partisan-Fleer:              Local elections. Martin:           And I went home and got out the phone book and the faculty directory and went through to see how many people I knew and thought I knew favorably. I probably overstated the favorably part. But I found that I knew 125 potential voters and that&#x27;s not very much. Yet the previous two elections that would have been enough to win, to get elected. One hundred and ten, one hundred and fifteen is what this fifth place had . . . Well, that was a disastrous strategy because that year we had a bond vote to run sewer lines down Concord Road. There was a big turnout against that. No one knew how I voted, how I felt about that because I wasn&#x27;t campaigning, right. It wasn&#x27;t the issues. It just produced a big turnout of people who didn&#x27;t know me. People, by and large, will vote for somebody they know, unless they have a bad relationship. Generally it&#x27;s an idle relationship or an acquaintance relationship and that&#x27;s enough. People will vote for somebody that they know before somebody they don&#x27;t. I never again agreed not to campaign. From then on I campaigned starting in 1966 for county commission as vigorously as I could make it. Fleer:              Now you talked about this theme of sort of a paring back and reducing the federal government, putting more responsibility on local, and in a sense, maybe state; although you mentioned primarily local. This was a theme that Barry Goldwater was identified with at around the time that you were involved. Were you interested in or aware of his particular activities? Martin:           I bought several of his books along in the early sixties. Since I was active in the precinct I was a precinct worker for Barry Goldwater. It&#x27;s funny, the Davidson newspaper had a picture they published that showed the back of our car which was a 1957 Chevrolet. Fleer:              I know exactly the one. Martin:           Beautiful car. The bumper sticker on one side where I was standing said &quot;Goldwater,&quot; and on the other side where Dotty was standing it said &quot;Johnson.&quot; We&#x27;ve still got that in our scrapbook. She didn&#x27;t share my views at that time, my hopes and thoughts about party politics. Her family had been Democrats and so she&#x27;s joined Democrats. Fleer:              So it did, in fact, represent a- Martin:           When I was a candidate, she switched so she could support me in the primary. 11 Fleer:              That&#x27;s fascinating. That must have been a useful experience in itself to try to bridge those interests in your family. Martin:           There are other issues. Racial issues were still divisive then, as they were for hundreds of years, as they still are. They&#x27;re not going to be easily overcome in a pluralistic society. My views on that were not well developed. I got involved in issues that I could understand and could participate in. I grew up in a racially segregated town and school system. In fact, Davidson was. When I went to school there it was all white. As a faculty member, I supported the first efforts to bring in not African Americans but Africans. Our first black students of the negro race were Africans because it was easier for a mission oriented church to support that at a day when it was politically very volatile. But I and my family have in every way that we can, have been a part of trying to open those doors and build opportunities and relationships. We can get into that when we talk about a particular congressional campaign. That wasn&#x27;t much of an issue as a county commissioner. Fleer:              That raises the question in my mind- Martin:           But in the early sixties that was not an issue with me. Fleeer:            -because some people believe that, maybe wrongly, that in the 1960s one of the components of the emphasis on local and state government was, in fact, motivated by a concern about not advancing the rights of African Americans and other minorities but that- Martin:           I don&#x27;t think that perception was wrong. It was not my motivation. Because indeed one of the reasons I decided I needed to run for local government, for town council, lost, then for county commissioner and won was that I thought that there was a responsibility for local government to deal with education, with the health, with job opportunities, with mobility of citizens. That didn&#x27;t mean that I was in favor of the federal government doing it. I had a clear political philosophical conviction that the federal government was not the best place to do it. If it was by default the only place dealing with those issues, I could understand that. But I was convinced it was not the best place. I still believe the best reconciliation of racial tensions is at a personal level. The next best is the neighborhood and job site. The next best is the community. The next best is the town, the county, then the part of the state, then the state and finally national and international. The best place to deal with it is personal because that&#x27;s where the problem has been. It&#x27;s the personal wariness, the personal rivalries about some other group of people taking away our jobs. It&#x27;s those kinds of things that create the hatreds, the animosities or, the lesser level, the suspicion and the neglect. 12 Fleer: Was that particular- Martin:           I mean I don&#x27;t think I had thought that through very well in the early sixties. I began to focus on that in the late sixties at the time of the civil rights movement.. . becoming more sharply focused and then especially while I was a county commissioner who was not in favor of moving black or white students across the county to achieve a mathematical ratio of attendance. Neither did I feel that blacks should be prohibited from living in parts of town where they would be in the minority. That was the pattern back in those days. So that at the time that Martin Luther King was assassinated and many communities with strong racial minorities were in flames and subject to a lot of violence and torching, in Charlotte we tried to mobilize a peaceful response to that. We had a town meeting with a packed auditorium, the Owen&#x27;s Auditorium, there&#x27;s about 3000 seats there out on Independence Boulevard. I remember going there as a county commissioner and being expected to speak. Nobody knew what I was going to say. The night before I determined that I would make an appeal for Mecklenburg County, not the United States, not the United Nations but Mecklenburg County to establish ordinances, figure out what was necessary, establish ordinances to make clear that people could live wherever they wanted to live. An open housing ordinance. Maybe it was naive to think I could just say that and argue for it as a faculty member would do without it becoming noticed; but the next day it was the blazing headline. Fleer:              Were you both faculty member and member of the commission at that time? Martin:           Yes. The county commission then didn&#x27;t pay very much. It really doesn&#x27;t even yet in relation to what it takes. So that I was relieved of some faculty committee duties and faculty responsibility for counseling freshmen students and those kinds of things. That still left me with about a thirty hour, thirty-five hour work week at college and twenty-five hour work week at county. I was chairman at that time. Fleer:              I didn&#x27;t mean to interrupt you but what you were saying is that that speech then became the headline in the paper the next morning? Martin:           That was a footnote; that was not the point. The point I was building was whether I realized what the political impact would be very clearly which resulted from that headline? I don&#x27;t think I really anticipated that. I was responding to a need to build a peacemaking response in our community. I saw no reason why government or anybody under the blessing of government should be able to tell an American citizen that they had to live in a certain area and couldn&#x27;t live wherever they wanted to. That begs the question of how people can afford to live in areas where the prices are higher. But that&#x27;s a different question. First thing is government should not block you from being able to live where you want to live 13 and anybody under the blessing the imprimatur, the sanction of government should not be able to tell you where you had to live. Fleer:              Did you in that discussion deal with this fairly significant obstacle of how it would be that you would implement and achieve this goal of mixed communities? That was far down the road but... Martin:           It was within the next year or so that Congress acted on that and preempted it. Then it was mute. The immediate reaction was that there were very few politicians who wanted to talk to me about it. Therefore there was no way to build any kind of consensus. I stuck by it. I continued to advocate that. Fleer:              Whenever you were- Before you got to that stage, can you talk a little bit about how it was that you made the decision to go from a grass roots organizer to a candidate for an elected office. Martin:           Well the first time as a candidate was running for town board. That was not a profound thought process. I just realized that in addition to my teaching end of side A Tape 1 SideB Martin:           responsibilities and relationship with students and I also had responsibilities, I was a tuba player in the Charlotte Symphony. I&#x27;d like to say I was first chair. But if you know the symphonic repertoire, usually unless its Richard Strauss there&#x27;s just one tuba. Fleer:              I played one too. Martin:           Really? Great. Well we&#x27;ve got that in common. And I was it. Later as a member of Congress I got my political supporters to endow a tuba chair in the Charlotte symphony so my name is on it. But I was also a high school football official. I had that night out with the boys and then with the symphony rehearsals, a night out with the boys and the girls. Those were civic activities. Went to JC meetings, those kinds of things. Active in the church. Was a deacon, we had that office then. But I felt it was consistent with that that I should participate in local government because that was the thing that I was identified with in local politics and so that was just a natural thing. It was not a soul searching. It was not something that I felt I was ordained to do. I knew full well I could be defeated; though I had confidence 125 friends would carry me through. I actually got 130 14 votes but it took 150 to win. That was the extent of that. When I ran for county commissioner three years later, I was recruited. It&#x27;s because I had been involved in precinct meetings and had gone to the county convention. I guess it came to the attention of the party leaders that up here in North Mecklenburg where Republicans weren&#x27;t known to exist or vote or be tolerated, here is this young professor up there. So they came to see me, a group of four. Fleer:              These were party people? Martin:           Party leaders to recruit me to run for the state legislature. I hadn&#x27;t thought about that. Didn&#x27;t know why they were coming to see me. Now that was in, it would probably have been around January of 1966, before the filing deadline. I could not run for the legislature because there&#x27;s no way I could make a living as a college professor if I took time off to go to the legislature. The income was marginal to begin with without taking part of it and setting it aside. Then the discussion got around to running for county commissioner. I thought about that. Again, that was a step up from town council. If I couldn&#x27;t get elected to town council, I probably couldn&#x27;t get elected to county commissioner. They were very realistic. But there were five commissioners elected at large which meant that they all had the benefit of the large Democrat voting population. We&#x27;d probably lose but they wanted a slate. So I agreed to do that. Two interesting stories about that. First is, they were led to me by a friend named Ken Harris who later became mayor of Charlotte. Ken was my trust officer. Believe me in the mid-sixties, this young college professor didn&#x27;t need a trust officer. Charitable remainder trusts weren&#x27;t known in those days. Fleer:              Right. Martin:           They&#x27;re a useful device now. We had to have a will and we had a trust in case anything ever got put into it. This young fellow who was a trust officer at then North Carolina National Bank. He said well, how about Martin, why don&#x27;t you all go over there and talk to him. I guess they were trying to recruit him and he turned them over to me. I&#x27;ve often kidded him, if you can&#x27;t trust your trust officer, who do you trust? That was the initiative of that. I&#x27;d been at a precinct meeting and county convention so they knew who I was and felt comfortable and came and we talked. Got around to county commissioner, I told them as they were there, I agreed, okay, I&#x27;ll do that. I learned a valuable lesson and embarrassment because you notice that time sequence. They came to see me and I agreed. I had not discussed this with my dear wife. She did not think that was a very smart thing for me to do and was offended that I would make such a decision without discussing it. I felt badly about that and I called them up immediately and said, &quot;Please don&#x27;t announce this. Don&#x27;t share it. I&#x27;ve got to take time to re-think through this and to talk with my wife about it.&quot; I&#x27;m bearing my soul here to you 15 but I&#x27;ve told it to some other people. It was part of what I had to learn as a young fellow in those days. My responsibilities as husband and provider weren&#x27;t given the full attention for this issue as they should have been. We did talk about it and ultimately she did agree, reluctantly, that I would do this for a while but if it hurt us financially it wasn&#x27;t as bad as going for the legislature. She agreed with that, I would have to back off, I couldn&#x27;t do it long. So get it out of my system. Probably would lose anyway. Then the night of the election- We campaigned as well as we could. I went to as many events as I could. The college administration, of course, agreed they needed to have someone on the faculty who was participating in let&#x27;s say &quot;right wing politics&quot; to offset the numerous participation in the &quot;left wing politics.&quot; They had been told by people like Charlie Cannon, for example, that he was very reluctant to give them money with the faculty as leftist as it was with people who were regarded to be communists, others who were socialists. I guess they figured well, yes, but see we got this fellow who ran for county commissioner on the other side. That might balance things out. Well, we actually won. We&#x27;ll get back to that later but on election night, this is the family personal side, my brother, Joe, and his wife and a couple of others had a little election night reception. I remember he had made a card . . We actually had this at the home of an English professor, Tony Abbott, Anthony S. Abbott and his wife, Susan, who were our closest friends on the faculty there. But we were at their home and Joe had made this card that you could slide one part of it and change the word from &quot;consolation&quot; to &quot;congratulations.&quot; Just a little part would change as you slid this thing across. Everybody knew I was going to get beat and we were celebrating a valiant effort and turned out that Republicans swept four of the five seats. While the Democrat who had been chairman, Sam Atkinson, led the ticket overall, the other four Democrats who had relied on him for decisions and publicity and everything else they got beat by the Republicans. I led the Republican side and later on became chairman because of that. So that&#x27;s how I got into that decision to run for county commissioner. Fleer:              That was, overall, a good year for Republicans. Martin:            1966 was a huge year for Republicans locally and state-wide. We elected several state legislators for the first time. We had had two county commissioners in 1962 and they were defeated in 1964. So this was just the next time. But in 1966 there was a tide that went the other way. It didn&#x27;t lift all boats enough but it lifted enough so that the stronger campaigns on the Republican side could get elected. I learned a lesson from that. The keys to winning an election for most candidates are two-fold.   One is to have a strong enough base from the party that you&#x27;re close to the 50% margin. The other is you&#x27;ve got to work hard enough with enough resources to build, to be among those who get across into the winning column because not everybody&#x27;s going to do it in a competitive environment. 16 Fleer:              So the party, at this stage, was seen as a very important organization for you. Martin:           Yes sir. I didn&#x27;t realize that the Republican appeal would be as strong as it was that year. I knew that President Johnson was being criticized and I was beginning to learn that&#x27;s part of the way things are. Did not realize that he would hurt his party so badly then that he would step aside shortly. Fleer:              Were the party efforts that you were aware of then, and in a sense benefitted from, essentially local efforts or was there a state-wide contribution of any consequence? Martin:           Before election to county commissioner it was entirely local and small potatoes. Fleer:              I didn&#x27;t mean necessarily money; organization, encouragement. Martin:           I didn&#x27;t need any money. I spent time on local precinct organization and in running for county commissioner I had to visit parts of Mecklenburg County I&#x27;d never heard of, in the same County. See I didn&#x27;t grow up there. I grew up in Fairfield County, South Carolina, Winnsboro and so I had to go in. I didn&#x27;t know people downtown. The business leadership. They didn&#x27;t know me. So that was not among my strengths in that first election. But after I won and had the majority and six months later became chairman of the county board of commissioners, they needed to get to know me. And I had an opportunity to get to know them. That&#x27;s true not only of downtown, which in Charlotte up. Until recently the business leadership has been very positive and influential in helping the city to grow the way it ought to grow. Fleer:              In terms of building a coalition, if that&#x27;s not too grand a word, to use in your effort to become elected, was that a conscious effort at that time? Can you see if it were a conscious effort the beginnings of your knowledge of coalition building at that stage or did that come later? Martin:           Running for county commissioner in 1966 didn&#x27;t really need a coalition. If it did I didn&#x27;t know anything about it. I was pretty naive, politically. I had my little area of interest in the precinct organization. That was it. Had my area of interest in the political debate. I got into some international issues, some other issues but was pretty limited because I started late. It wasn&#x27;t like somebody who&#x27;d spent all their life in politics and knew the ins and outs of it. So I was pretty naive. In some ways you could say I was opportunistic. I happened to pick a year when Republicans had strength. Fleer:              Timing. 17 Martin:           If I had run in 1964, that would have been the end of my political career right there. Why do that again? But I won. Then you not only get the exhilaration of winning and that satisfaction and a certain measure of preening and self-aggrandizement that goes with that, but you also get an opportunity to serve which you don&#x27;t get if you lose. An opportunity to serve is also very satisfying and rewarding in that sense. It wasn&#x27;t financially rewarding; but certainly spiritually and psychically, the rewards were huge. Things began to lead in that way. I had another opportunistic campaign in 1972 when I first ran for Congress. Opportunistic because Charlie Jonas, my predecessor, was a Republican and had been in twenty years. People were learning how to vote for a Republican congressman. So that was opportunistic. He helped recruit me and talked to me about it. His son was also interested, Charlie Junior. But he decided not to run. I did and had a primary. Had to go through that. I came up opportunistically there. When I ran for governor in a way I was looking for a way to get out of Washington. We&#x27;ll get back to this later. I was tired of being in an everlasting minority in Congress. I had enough thrill and satisfaction. I was ready to go back to private life. Of course, for curious reasons the best way out was to run for governor. Then it would be either up or out. And with governor you only serve by then two terms. So that was opportunistic. I have not had a lifelong plan of political ladders to climb. I did not have an ambition to run for anything. Felt an obligation to run for town council. Was whipped. Was recruited to run for county commission. Thought we would lose but the opportunity was better than I knew. I didn&#x27;t build any coalition around that. That was earlier. It was later that I began to build support. I needed coalitions when some Republicans turned away from me after the statement about open housing. I needed to replace that support somewhere. When I ran for Congress I had professional political advice. It was abundantly clear that I needed not only to maximize the Republican power base in the district but in order to do it I had to reach across to people who were not accustomed to voting for a Republican for Congress because I was not Charlie Jonas. They knew him and respected him. They didn&#x27;t know me. How could they know to vote for me. These were the ticket splitters who vote for whom they regard as the best candidates of both parties. They weren&#x27;t voting, you know, vote for me just because I&#x27;m a Republican. Had to give them a reason. So we had to build coalitions of that kind at that time. That was the first time. I insisted that my campaign for Congress in 1972 reach out and try to build as much support within the black community as we could. By that time the black voting population could be shown to be voting 98% for Democrats and 2% for Republicans. Certainly in organized precincts that was the case. So we made efforts to try to build bridges across that. A lot of political advisors said that&#x27;s foolish; no point in working where 98% is going to vote against you. Better to leave that alone and go work in the precincts that have voted Republican in the past. Well, I of course we did the latter but I did the former also. 18 Fleer: This is a very conscious decision on your part. Martin:           I felt that the Republican Party on the one hand was getting racially polarized. Not &quot;was getting,&quot; was racially polarized and that the black population was partisan polarized. Thirty years before they were all Republicans. The party of Lincoln. The party that couldn&#x27;t win anything. Here in the early seventies they had changed over because of the Great Society programs and other things. The Voting Rights Act and those kinds of things which they should have acknowledged and dealt with accordingly. So they had moved that large group of voters into the Democrat column. I was thinking I&#x27;ve got to win some of that back. This is not right for the party to divorce itself entirely from the interests of black voters and then make black voters and their needs and aspirations campaign issues. As today you see Republicans in our area bashing away at homosexuals because they figure that&#x27;s an organizing principle. In my day it was becoming the organizing principal of the Republican Party. I just felt the thing I could do about that was not to fall on my sword but to go out and try to recruit people to support me. Black people, voters, to support me. Didn&#x27;t do very well but in that race- It depends on how you measure it. If you&#x27;re expecting to get 2% or 5% at the best then the fact that we got 15% would be ... Fleer:              -an achievement. Martin:           . . an achievement. In our first campaign we didn&#x27;t do that. We got 4%. The next campaign we got 8%. We were measuring that because my advisors were trying to show me that it was futile and the third time around it was about double again, about 15%. Now we&#x27;re beginning to level off. By the time I ran for governor we had built it up to around 20%. Fleer:              Now during that time- Martin:           I felt you had to build that bridge. You&#x27;ve got to build it to get somebody bold enough to come over from the minority populations. You&#x27;ve got to have somebody bold enough to come over from the minority party side. To rebuild a relationship that had been damaged and that at that time because of the divorce or realignment, however you want to call it, I felt that was not in the interests of the black population and not in the interests of the Republican party. Fleer:              Did you run into any resistance within the Mecklenburg Republican Party or that district Republican organization on that matter? Martin:           Yes. There was resistance and disagreement and the argument that I mentioned before but that what I was doing was &quot;futile&quot; but... I pronounce it that way so it doesn&#x27;t sound like &quot;feudal&quot; because in this context you could get confused. There 19 was that kind of response but there wasn&#x27;t any organized resistance because nobody thought I was going to do anything with it and who cares? They had their own interests, their own views about it. Fleer:              So this was really a personal thing that you wanted to do, largely. Martin:           Absolutely. Fleer:              And also that you thought would contribute to your likely success or was that not an issue? Martin:           I could read political trends pretty well. I would say at that time, in 1972 and 1974 and 1976,1 would have expected, and my advisors were telling me this very clearly, that all of the time and effort that I spent trying to build minority racial support for a Republican candidate was going to hurt me because it would turn off some others. Yet it was something I had to do. It was about this time- I&#x27;m not sure of the exact year. You&#x27;d have to look it up but. . . ... it was about that time that efforts were underway integrating college campuses and high schools, when Harvey Gantt was admitted to Clemson University. Harvey Gantt who later was mayor of Charlotte, ran for United States Senator. But when he was a youngster and admitted to Clemson University there was a concern on my father&#x27;s part that South Carolina not do what some other states had done and resisted and have the governor standing in the doorway to block the admission of this young citizen who is coming to get an education. So he through his ecumenical, biracial, multi-racial clergy association made calls on the political leadership to urge them to be above that and to be hospitable and cordial. If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re entitled. It&#x27;s a free country. But don&#x27;t abuse this young man. We have nothing to fear from young Harvey Gantt getting an education. So that was going on in our family and was a growing part of me and I felt it was the right thing to do and if it defeated me, so be it. But if you, my advisors, think that&#x27;s going to hurt me then you better get out there and work a lot harder because I&#x27;m going to be me and if you want me to win then you better figure out how to win. We were running against a popular, very well known young athlete named Jim Beatty. Fleer:              Sure. Sure. Martin:           First to run the four minute mile indoors. His campaign ad showed him running around the track in his Carolina blue sweat suit. How could I deal with that? Fleer:              So you had Carolina problems too then. 20 Martin:           I ran the mile in high school, couldn&#x27;t get under five minutes. Okay, you want to take a break? Fleer:              Yes. Fleer:              We talked about the African Americans in your effort to increase the support for you and the Republican Party among African Americans. Were there other groups during this period of time when you were on the county commissioners and running for the Congress that you wanted to bring into the Republican Party and worked to attract? Martin:           One major aspect of the context of this question about building coalitions we need to reflect on a little bit. For the most part during my political career, the Republicans had not built coalitions as well as the Democrats had. President Bush talked about a big tent but that had more to do with not driving people out of the party. For most of that time Republicans were not very effective at building coalitions. They were instead trying to capture a broad segment of people who marched under a standard of more fiscal integrity and conservative principles because they believed that was the majority, if they could just get the people who agreed with what might be stated as Republican principles. Hadn&#x27;t won us a majority but it had elected several presidents around that. That would mean that you don&#x27;t offend coalitions but you stick to that theme and hopefully you capture it all. As I said, that wasn&#x27;t working for the broad range of Republicans and so some efforts were made and I&#x27;ve been a part of that. As I spoke a moment ago, I had my own effort to try and develop greater participation of black voters in the Republican Party and vice versa, Republican party listening to the interests expressed on behalf of communities of black voters and citizens and made some progress on that. Another group that I think can be identified that&#x27;s outside that traditional Republican drumbeat of fiscal conservatism and national policy would be the religious right. Prior to the emergence of the so-called Moral Majority they were diverse, dispersed, not coordinated. Maybe in many cases disillusioned with politics as everybody is from time to time and stayed out of it. So they weren&#x27;t much of a factor. As they began to get involved, they gravitated more toward the Republican side. Republicans welcomed them and appealed to them and made conscious efforts to accommodate some of their issues, put some of their themes up high. There are times when that has hurt the Republican Party but other times where it&#x27;s helped the Republican Party. For example, the emergence of a two party south would not have happened as soon as it did as it came up into the nineties with now half the members of Congress being Republicans in the south, with more county and city governments dominated by Republicans. Certainly the majority of county and city governments representing the majority of the people 21 are dominated by Republicans. You couldn&#x27;t have had that happen as quickly as it did without the support of the religious right. If the Republicans today were to cast them off and drive them out of the party, we would immediately be a minority party again. If, on the other hand, the religious right succeeds in driving everybody else out, it&#x27;ll be a minority party again. So that&#x27;s a dilemma. We&#x27;ve got to work with it. We&#x27;ve got to deal with it. But that was an important group that was not as welcome in the Democrat ranks because their themes were different. And they were welcomed on the Republican side and they helped to build a majority. Other than that- We&#x27;ve only crossed the board with the exception of a few of us who were able to get significant, not major but significant, votes from the black voters. There isn&#x27;t any other coalition partner that&#x27;s really added that much voting strength to the Republican side. Fleer:              Would the religious right, although it wasn&#x27;t organized and named as such back in the 1970s, was that a group that you were particularly interested in or concerned about accommodating within the Republican party when you were running for commissioner or member of Congress? Martin:           As a commissioner that was not much of an interest. As a candidate for Congress there were issues that were more important to them and therefore I had to talk with them just like I had to talk with other groups who had their issues and I found that my philosophy was well respected by them. Interestingly I did not join their issue to advocate a ban on all abortions. I do not favor abortion. I certainly find it repugnant, the techniques, either medications or surgical techniques that are use later on in abortions. I feel that any fetus that could possibly survive outside the womb should have a chance to do that even if the mother doesn&#x27;t want to carry it to term.   It shouldn&#x27;t be destroyed but she should- If she&#x27;s going to discharge that child prematurely then we have neonatal intensive care units that could be used. I have that kind of view on that issue. While I would favor states dealing with it, I didn&#x27;t think it was something that was justified as a Supreme Court decision. I&#x27;m not a judge; not a lawyer. But I find that to be a very strained interpretation of the United States Constitution to say that the mother has that right to choose and the child doesn&#x27;t. The unborn child doesn&#x27;t. But as a political issue states should be able to deal with it and before the U.S. Supreme Court announced that decision, the State of North Carolina was already allowing it. There&#x27;s a political issue, deal with politically. What I&#x27;m doing is describing what was more a middle position on a very serious issue which is politically volatile. I did not support having a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions. I did not support legislation to ban all abortions. I, on the other hand, did not support the state providing the funding for elective abortions. I use that phrase to differentiate from those that have a medical necessity of which, in my view, would include rape and incest. It would include any situation where the life of the mother was at risk. That&#x27;s a tough choice and you deal with that and if that&#x27;s the choice I&#x27;d be 22 willing for the state to pay for that for someone who&#x27;s eligible for Medicaid. But for cases just for economic preference or because some genetic analysis showed that there&#x27;s going to be some damage and you didn&#x27;t want to have to fool with it, I can&#x27;t see paying, the state paying, for that abortion. Fleer:              So that issue of abortion and the religious right were important and you tried to accommodate it by essentially a middle of the road position. Martin:           Accommodated by stating clearly my position. I found that because I was with them some of the time, not with them other times on other issues, they at least respected the fact that I was saying the same thing to them that I said to others. They settled for that and supported me. Others have tried to play both sides and they lose both sides. Lee Atwater had, I think, a wonderful strategy for dealing with the abortion issue. That is because it&#x27;s so important answer the question what you believe and then get off of it. Don&#x27;t beat the drums. There&#x27;s a small minority that will vote against you if you are for any kind of abortion. There&#x27;s a small minority that will vote against you if you&#x27;re against any kind of abortion. The vast majority have their own views but don&#x27;t want to hear a lot about it. They don&#x27;t want you beating the drums about it. And I expect the same thing is true about the gay rights. Most people just don&#x27;t want that to be hammered at them all the time. Fleer:              Governor, in your experience as a member of the county board of commissioners and as a member of the United States House of Representatives could you reflect on lessons that you learned that might have contributed to your interest in and serving as governor of North Carolina. Martin:           There&#x27;s an issue that was very important to me when I was running for county commissioner the first time. It&#x27;s about the only issue I had which was a part of my service on the county commission and which I feel very good about, we achieved something; which was not a particular issue of mine in Congress but which was an issue at the State and that is public education. I respect private schools, not just higher education where I attended Davidson and went to Princeton. But I respect private elementary and secondary schools and the right of people to make those kinds of choices for their children. But I&#x27;ve felt a very strong obligation to the public school system. When I ran for the county commissioner, my particular theme was that we need to support schools, not attack them. The previous board of the county commissioners, not for partisan reasons but just for who they were and their insights, all five Democrats, would demean the public schools. They would attack the public schools. They would start their budget hearings by posting on the wall the current tax rate and they would point to it and say that&#x27;s going to be the tax rate when we get finished. All in favor say aye. Aye. And then they would proceed to bring in all the departments, saving the school board 23 to last and if the sheriff needed a little more money or the jail or the public libraries need a little more money, all worthwhile things, if the water and sewer or health department needed a little more money, they&#x27;d do it. But if that tax rate is going to stay the same every time they give more money to everybody else it means the schools are going to get less and less. That&#x27;s exactly what happened. So that as we began our campaign the issue that I started to address and some of the other Republicans did too and were able to do something about was we&#x27;re going to change that. We&#x27;re going to put first things first. Our biggest responsibility is for public schools. We need to put that first. We don&#x27;t bring them in last, we bring them in first. Then they said, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re going to raise taxes.&quot; Well my answer to that was, and I carried this over as governor, if you budget for schools first you don&#x27;t have to raise taxes for schools. You do that first then you look at your second priority and then you look at your third and your fourth. Because what you find is if you go in order of priority with schools being first, you still got money to do some improvements. Not everything but some. And where you run out of money is when you get to your 20th or 28th priority and who&#x27;s going to raise taxes for their 28th priority? You don&#x27;t need to. Nobody expects you to and why should you raise taxes for your first priority if you budget for them first? And it was a neat thing and we were able to increase spending for public schools. We passed a bond issue after predecessors had refused to hold one for school construction. And so that was an issue that came out of my background as a teacher. It was a natural for county commission because in North Carolina the counties, and certainly there, the county had responsibility for a consolidated school system and levied the taxes to pay for it. The school board does not have a separate tax levy. They have to go to the county commissioners to weigh that against other needs and I was saying their balance plan is defective. They&#x27;re weighing the schools lighter and putting more into the pan with the other important things. We reversed that and made a political issue of it. I didn&#x27;t get onto that subject so much in Congress because again one of my prevailing philosophical themes is I want local governments and states to be dealing with their responsibilities and not have the federal government come in and do it for them. That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t some things that local governments just refuse to do and the federal government. . . I&#x27;m just saying that was not an issue then. When I ran for governor that was a prime thing. Of course, in North Carolina the state has the biggest responsibility for public schools. That&#x27;s why every governor, the Democrats like to say since Charles Brantley Aycock, was an education governor. I&#x27;d say since Daniel Russell the Republican whom he defeated because Daniel Russell started it. In fact you can go back to the Whigs. They built some public schools for the first three or four grades but that was, you know, a movement. But every governor in this century has been an education governor. It&#x27;s the biggest thing you&#x27;ve got to deal with. I made that an issue and used that same formulation. I had found and shown that over the previous 26 years, 28 years, 7 terms, an unbroken string of six governors, one of whom served two 24 terms, 28 consecutive years the percentage of the state budget that went for public schools had declined every year except two. It went up in 1966,1 believe it was, and it went up in one year in Bob Scott&#x27;s term. No the last year of Jim Hunt&#x27;s term, the last year. But in all the other years it had gone down. Over each four year term it had gone down as a percentage of the state budget. You could argue now that&#x27;s because the state had so many more responsibilities and indeed it does. All these things need money and indeed they do. But if you&#x27;re going to raise taxes, base it on your 20th priority, not your 1st priority. Put first things first and so in my budget I would emphasis that and certainly it wouldn&#x27;t have happened if the legislature hadn&#x27;t voted more money for schools. But they didn&#x27;t vote more money for schools before I got there. I made it an issue and I couldn&#x27;t very well partner with them to do it because I was Republican and they were Democrats. So my strategy was to contend with them. Compete with them. See who can do the most for public schools. See who can show the strongest support. Here&#x27;s my stand and if you don&#x27;t want to do it my way, do something else but do more for schools and they did it.   So that was a theme that carried over very well. Fleer:              If we may, let&#x27;s move into talking about the decision to run for governor. How did that come about? What caused you to change your focus from continued service in the United States Congress to running for governor? Martin:           I think you can see from what I&#x27;ve said so far, I didn&#x27;t really have any prior interest in running for governor or anything higher. I had been recruited by the Reagan administration to serve as Environmental Protection Administrator. I ended up turning them down after considering it a little bit. Anne Gorshuck whom they picked in my place had a lot of problems that I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to deal with. But I really didn&#x27;t initiate that, they did. And I turned it down. So I had no ambition to go higher. But I had determined that it was time for me to leave the Congress and there was not a gentlemanly way for me to leave Congress. I certainly was not going to scandalize myself. I was not going to run a campaign designed to lose. I couldn&#x27;t just quit and this is really the heart of it because in every congressional campaign my handlers would see to it that we ended up with a debt the night I was elected. So I&#x27;d have $150,000 debt to pay off which I couldn&#x27;t afford. The only way I could eliminate that debt was to go out and start raising money to pay it off. The only way I could do that was to tell people I was going to run for another term. I&#x27;m serious. I knew they were doing it and I couldn&#x27;t stop it. I was not a fund raiser. I was not in charge of it. They could raise it fine after I was elected. They could do pretty good before I was elected. They&#x27;d spend it before I got elected and then raise the rest of the money. That meant I didn&#x27;t have any way to leave Congress unless I could finish a campaign with no debt. In 1983 it was coming time to pay off the 1982 election debt and the election for governor was coming up. I began to just look at that because I had several friends who were looking at it. They weren&#x27;t asking me to run. I was not 25 really recruited to run for governor. I was recruited for county commissioner, was recruited by Charlie Jonas to run for Congress and encouraged by some others. But when I ran for governor that was my decision and my interpretation. Interestingly Dottie welcomed that because here was a decision to put it on the line for a higher office and if we lose that&#x27;s the end of it, we go back to private life. We stood valiantly. We did our best and we would. And if we won, which is what we intended to, then 8 years later there would be a natural end of my career in politics. That&#x27;s going to sound funny to somebody looking at it but that was a serious problem for me. I had enjoyed most of being in Congress. I was tiring of it. Saw no chance of Republicans getting the majority. Early on I thought Nixon was going to lead us to the majority. That didn&#x27;t happen. Reagan wasn&#x27;t leading us to a majority. At that time he was in his first term, coming up on re-election. No prospect of Republicans getting anywhere close to a majority. I never felt that politics would be my lifelong career. At that time I was looking for a respectable way to conclude my political career and if serving four years, eight years as governor, that&#x27;d be great. The more I learned about it that looked like a very interesting and challenging and satisfying job. I didn&#x27;t know as much about it, of course, as I soon learned. There also was the situation which appealed to me was that there were about eight candidates on the Democrat side, four of whom were strong. You had a lieutenant governor, Jimmy Green. You had my good friend Eddie Knox who had been mayor of Charlotte and a state legislator and a lot of things. He was running. You had Rufus Edmisten, the state attorney general and you had John Ingram. end of side B tape 1 26 Southern Oral History Program North Carolina Politics Int. with James G. Martin 2/6/98 Int. by Jack Fleer Audio cassette 2 of 3 Martin:           ... So with Lauch Faircloth that meant five prominent state-wide established politicians who are going to fight each other to the death. I figured and my advisors agreed that we could probably pick up some of that support. Only one of them would emerge as the Democratic nominee and that meant at least that the more conservative ones, Faircloth and Knox and Jimmy Green had supporters who at least we could try to get. They might swing over to each other but if John Ingram or Edmisten got the nomination, those people would not go that way and indeed that&#x27;s how it turned out. Because you had Knox and Edmisten in the runoff. All of Green&#x27;s people switched over to us. They felt that Edmisten had savaged him unfairly in their view by getting him indicted for something that a U.S. investigation did not find grounds for indictment. He was acquitted. But to say somebody&#x27;s acquitted doesn&#x27;t ring any voting bells. So they felt that was the purpose of the indictment was even if he was acquitted he&#x27;d be destroyed. So regardless of what the truth was of all that, they came over to my side. Knox&#x27;s people came over in droves because they felt that Edmisten had treated him very shabbily in the campaign. So we were opportunistic in building on that. In late 1982, right after that election and early &#x27;83 I could see the potential for that and didn&#x27;t know it would be as good as it was because I had a big margin of victory over Edmisten. So I didn&#x27;t know it would be like that. I thought it was a winnable thing and my campaign advisers agreed it would be winnable. They also argued that it was losable and they&#x27;d rather me stay in Congress. They felt better having somebody that they knew and was easy to get me elected to Congress. Pay off that debt after I win. They liked that pattern but they didn&#x27;t deny me. There was one fellow, interestingly, a fraternity brother from Davidson named Rusty Goode, Sedom Good, Jr., whose shoes I had shined as a freshman in fraternity. He came to me to tell me that I must not run for governor and the reason was because he had already agreed to support Ed Knox. He was very open about it. He said, &quot;Look, you can&#x27;t do this to me. I&#x27;ve already committed publicly. I&#x27;ve got to support Knox. I can&#x27;t support both of y&#x27;all and I can&#x27;t work against you but I cannot fail to do what I&#x27;ve agreed to do for Knox. It&#x27;s important. We need to elect somebody from Charlotte. We never been able to do that in so long.&quot; Well, since 27 Cameron Morrison in the twenties. I said to him, &quot;Rusty, I appreciate that but how do you know he&#x27;s going to win the primary?&quot; He got in the runoff but how do you know he&#x27;s going to win the primary? What if he&#x27;s beat in the primary? Then where are you? Then it&#x27;s over. I made a case to him that I&#x27;d thought about because someone said to me how can anybody from Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, even though we were living in Iredell County at the time, I was associated with Mecklenburg. No opponent would let me get away with saying I wasn&#x27;t and I wasn&#x27;t going to do that. The only property we owned was on Lake Norman up in Iredell County, barely. I had looked into that and had concluded, I still think rightly, that its difficult for a Democrat from Charlotte to win because of the particular demographics of the party and because there is a counter-play in the East against monster Mecklenburg. But that&#x27;s not a Republican area. More important people who were going to vote for Republicans usually are doing it on issues, not because their daddy did. You recognize that. It&#x27;s because that&#x27;s where they believe they should vote and they&#x27;re not going to care where you&#x27;re from. They don&#x27;t even care that I wasn&#x27;t born in North Carolina. Rufus brought that up late in the campaign and I had thought of that. I said, &quot;Well, I had to be near my mother at the time because she was in Savannah.&quot; Fleer:              I recall. Martin:           You can&#x27;t make anything ... what&#x27;s he going to say about that? It became a non- issue. Certainly for people who would go for a Republican, they didn&#x27;t care. Maybe some of the people who voted for Rufus cared but 56% didn&#x27;t care that I was from Charlotte. People who would vote for a Republican, I argued, are not going to vote against you because you&#x27;re from Charlotte. They might because if you&#x27;re a Democrat. Indeed Eddie Knox lost a lot of strength in the runoff because Edmisten could hammer at him because he voted against East Carolina Medical School. At the time, anybody from Charlotte would vote against East Carolina Medical School because they were voting for having one at Charlotte. Just like their ancestors voted for the first University of North Carolina medical school to be there and they lost to Chapel Hill. This time they lost to East Carolina but they had to vote for their own area, but he could get pounded for that. I did not get in on that battle. So nobody could make that issue. With all of that, Eddie was vulnerable there and so I made the point. I didn&#x27;t get into East Carolina. I just said, &quot;Well, if there&#x27;s a problem for somebody from the East, somebody from Charlotte getting elected state-wide it&#x27;s because of the Democratic strength and the East isn&#x27;t going to vote for them.&quot; With Republicans that&#x27;s not an issue. In any case he didn&#x27;t prevail. I went ahead and ran. Knox did lose the primary and at that point Rusty came over. He and a young fellow from Winston-Salem or King, actually, named Charlie Shelton and Richard Pugh from over in Asheboro and a couple of other fellows raised a nice ton of money for me. 28 Fleer: That helped. Martin:           Yea, that helped a great deal. If you go back to that decision to run, I didn&#x27;t feel an obligation that I had to run for higher office but that was an attractive way to close my political career. Fleer:              Now as you made that decision on more or less a personal basis that this is a way out of the Congress, so to speak, what did you do-Martin:           -and my wife liked that. Fleer:              And your wife like that. What did you do in terms of trying to test that decision with other people? Obviously it was good for you but was it good for the Republican Party? Or even the state? Martin:           Jim Holshouser had been elected in 1972, served one term, did not have a constitutional opportunity to run for a second term. It was his successor, Jim Hunt, who got the legislature and then the vote of the people to approve the constitutional amendment to allow a second term. His second term was up at about this time which is why you had all this pentup demand from people who couldn&#x27;t run four years before. Fleer:              In the Democratic party. Martin:           Yes, the Democratic side of it. As I started to organize it, the first thing I had to do, after talking with Dottie this time because I figured she would like this and she really did. She didn&#x27;t like maintaining two different homes. The problem of her being in Alexandria, Virginia, where we had our family and my flying back and forth to Charlotte and being gone on at least half or more of the weekends. They only pay for half so that&#x27;s all I could afford. Couldn&#x27;t afford to take her and so she stayed there and I was gone. That jammed up the rest of the week. She didn&#x27;t like the fact that if we made plans, for example, on our minister&#x27;s birthday, to take him and his wife out to see a movie and have ice cream. You know, something just innocent and idle like that. And if the speaker or the committee chairman decided they needed to meet that evening I had to call and cancel and let them go on without me. There was just too much of that, not being able to control our own life. You can put up with that a while and certainly you can do your duty for a while. After a while that was part of the burden that made it unattractive to keep living that way. So I knew she would find it appealing. She wouldn&#x27;t know if I could win or not but it was okay either way. Win or lose. So then I called my closest advisers and started to talk with them about it. Fleer:              Were these professional people who are political leaders in the state, if you can 29 make that distinction? Martin:           Both. Both. There was one man on whom I built my major political career and who built his political advisor&#x27;s career on me. His name was Brad Hays. Brad was an organizational genius. He learned how to do all the technical parts of the campaign. He was excellent on strategy.   He had his own views and ideas as to what position I should take on issues. But he settled for just being able to tell me what he thought and accepted that I was going to-decide what I would do. He had that measure of humility but he devoted his life to working for me from 1972 on to this death which was right after the election as I left office. Brad Hays had been a nuclear engineer at the Savannah River Atomic Energy Plant and organized Republicans in Akin. Went to the Republican National Committee, the Congressional Campaign Committee as one of their operatives because he was good at it. That&#x27;s where Charlie Jonas found him and he was actually going to work for Charlie Jonas if Charlie had run for Congress. When Charlie didn&#x27;t I got him to work for me. Brad Hays was a very professional campaign leader. He could do tracking polls. He could do direct mail. We didn&#x27;t do these twenty page direct mail letters. We&#x27;d get it down to one or two pages because I wasn&#x27;t going-Fleer:              People would read it. Martin:           Yea, I wasn&#x27;t going to do that to somebody. But he could raise money that way to supplement what others could raise by direct calls. I was not comfortable and not good at raising money myself and didn&#x27;t know how I would handle it if somebody said, &quot;I&#x27;ll give you the money if you&#x27;ll do this.&quot; So rather than offend them and waste my time and because I was blessed with people who were willing to go out and do it as volunteers, I didn&#x27;t have to do that. He also raised some money with direct mail. And direct mail is a message as well as an appeal and so everybody that gets that at least they&#x27;ve got that message from me_______. He did not pretend to be a big league polling organization and therefore we hired somebody else who had national credentials. For one thing, if you go to raise money, you can&#x27;t say to somebody we&#x27;ve got our own polls but somebody you never heard of is doing our polling. So we had first Decision Making Information and then Lance Torrance. They do Republican polling on a big scale. But Brad would do it in between. I had that available. We hired an organization, national organization, for campaign ads later in my congressional campaigns and so they were available. They were in Washington so I could call on them to let them know what I was doing so they could start preparing for it and say whatever they wanted to say and share with me whatever they thought the chances were. I wanted to know what they thought. Then there were other people who were prominent in their fields in Charlotte, professional in their fields but not in politics. Like Bob Bradshaw who had been campaign manager the first time I ran for Congress, a lawyer in Charlotte who later became state party chair. Margaret 30 King who had run my second campaign. They and others had begun to talk. Rusty came up to see me as soon as he heard about it. I maybe should have talked with him before but there are others. And as I talked with Brother Joe and others I began- Fleer:              This is your brother ... Martin:           My brother, Joe Martin. I began to get more comfortable with the idea. Cass Ballenger who was a state senator from Catawba County and Hickory had announced that he was considering running. He hadn&#x27;t filed but had let it be known that he was going to run on the Republican ticket and that was only one. I knew Cass very well and liked him and thought that he and I, if we were going to compete in a primary, had to do it in a way that didn&#x27;t get personal. So I asked him to meet me. We met and talked about it. I told him what I was learning up to then as to where I thought I could win. I didn&#x27;t tell him he couldn&#x27;t but I just told him I&#x27;m going to run and will do what I can to win. Of course he said the same thing. But before long he reached a decision that he thought I had a better chance at it and deferred. He&#x27;s now a United States Congressman so obviously he had a lot of political strength and could have done a lot of things, might have himself been able be elected. But here, again, you don&#x27;t know. He certainly wanted the Republicans to have a strong campaign. He was willing to do it and probably had a chance to win. But he withdrew and Ruby Hooper got in the campaign. She and I had a very gentlemanly and gentlewomanly campaign. Afterwards she worked in my administration as assistant secretary for the Human Resources. Fleer:              Were there other leaders of the Republican party? Martin:           -and later as deputy secretary. Fleer:              Many of these people seem to be people who had some past association with you. Obviously that&#x27;s an important place to start. Were there others that you felt a need to contact and in a sense convince that you were the person? Martin:           That was the third wave. The first wave was to talk with Dottie this time. I learned that lesson good after the county commission. The second wave was these people who had been part of my campaigns and Cass. Third wave was to start calling on people across the state to try and win their support. Because at this point, I was psychologically committed to it. Yet it wasn&#x27;t going to happen if I just used my home team. I had to get a state-wide team together. So I began to call and found that among Republicans, active Republicans, I was well known. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected because they themselves were looking around. Who&#x27;s going to run for this? Who&#x27;s going to run for that? Who can run for governor? A United States congressman from anywhere would have been on their list. So they 31 were very receptive and it gave me a good strong base of support. I gradually widened that. I did start to call on some people who had contributed to congressional campaigns to ask if they would be supportive of a campaign for governor. They wanted to know who all was running. I told them and I bet 90% told me then that, yes, they would. I didn&#x27;t realize then that you could donate a lot more to a candidate for state office than you can for Congress. I was accustomed to the $1000 limit, federal limit. But it&#x27;s $4,000 per election, per family member. As long as it&#x27;s a genuine contribution. Fleer:              Now you talk about this idea of sort of identifying your desire to get away from the Congress. A respectable way. Martin:           To complete my career because I was not... I did not see myself as a career politician. Fleer:              You saw the divisions within the Democratic Party which were fairly significant because of pentup desires to be governor-Martin:           -and which became more prominent than I dreamed they would be. Fleer:              And you went around to professional people and party people both those who were associated with you in the past and others. What were you able to say and what did you believe at the time would enable you to convince enough people in the state to elect you as only the second Republican in this century to be elected? Martin:           Two things were clear to me would be to my benefit. One is that is if we could raise money and I thought we could. The response had been encouraging. The &quot;yes, I&#x27;ll support you. Don&#x27;t know how much.&quot; But from that encouragement I knew we could raise some serious money and that meant we&#x27;d be able to purchase advertising to get my message across the way I wanted to do it. I&#x27;m open to interviews with reporters but they&#x27;re only going to repeat something over and over if it&#x27;s damaging, whether it&#x27;s me or somebody else. They&#x27;re not going to repeat something that&#x27;s positive. It&#x27;s newsworthy once if its positive. Newsworthy 100 times if it&#x27;s negative. That&#x27;s not their fault. That&#x27;s the way it is. Nobody wants to read the same good news over and over, but repetition is what gets a message across. You learn that as educators. With money we could buy the repetition. We could buy advertising and it would be 30 second spots, minute spots, half hour specials, billboards. I&#x27;m not even in favor of billboards, but billboards get you name identification across better than anything else. It doesn&#x27;t get anything else across but it gets your name across. People start to remember the name. If they don&#x27;t remember the name they can&#x27;t associate your name with what you said and if they can&#x27;t do that then how can they vote for the person whose views they like if they can&#x27;t remember what the name was? So you&#x27;ve got to get name identification 32 but I figured we could buy all of that. Bumper stickers. Telephone banks. We had a technique in our congressional campaigns that we believed we could carry over to the statewide campaign and did with huge results where we would recruit block workers by phone, cold. Have a small team of telephone workers who would get the city directory and look up the phone numbers of any two names on a street and you call one of them and if that person says, &quot;yes, I&#x27;ll hand out your stuff,&quot; that&#x27;s it. You go on to the next card. If that person says &quot;no&quot; you call the second one. You get turned down two times. It its a long block you may have three names. If you get turned down two or three times why bother with the rest of them because the others are going to be handing out literature to the ones who just turned you down. This was a scheme, you see, and we&#x27;d start with districts that had voted Republican in the past and built strength. We found good receptivity in the congressional race. We recruited 5,000 volunteers to work their blocks. Statewide we recruited 50,000. It was a good thing. We had to have money for those kinds of operations. We had to have money for me to travel, be able to rent an airplane to go where you&#x27;ve got to go. I believe we could do that but the key was advertising. You&#x27;ve got to have serious money to get your message across. Now some people are against campaigns costing so much. I&#x27;d be against them costing so much if you could get the message across more economically but you can&#x27;t. The news media are not going to get your message across. They&#x27;ll get across your mistakes. I can&#x27;t fault them for that. But if I&#x27;m going to get my message across so that you&#x27;ll hear it, not you because you pay attention to politics, but so that the average voter who doesn&#x27;t read the political news can hear that message, I&#x27;ve got to go on television repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly on a basis that they calculate that every television viewer is going to see that ad at least three times and it&#x27;ll start to sink in. Fleer:              So you mentioned two things. One of them is money and the other is advertising. Martin:           No, that&#x27;s the same thing. Fleer:              That&#x27;s part of the same thing. Martin:           Advertising is the key and that&#x27;s why campaigns cost so much and there&#x27;s no way around that. You don&#x27;t get discounts for political ads. You&#x27;ve got to pay your full price. Fleer:              At least. Martin:           Right. So that takes money and I believed we&#x27;d get money. The second thing that led me to believe I could win was that I had followed as an amateur student of politics, a participant but an amateur student, I had followed the trend of the growth of the Republican Party. Since 1952, the election of Eisenhower, the 33 Republican Party has been growing. In 1951 there was a little book written by Alexander Heard, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, former history professor at Chapel Hill. The title of it was a question: &quot;A two party south?&quot; Question mark. The book was the negative, of course. The answer is, it will never happen. Dixiecrat movement is too ideal for the southern Democrat whose granddaddy will turn over in his grave if he voted for the party of Sherman and Ulysses Grant. But since then with the election of Eisenhower and Charlie Jonas that year, 1952, the south began to get stronger and stronger on the Republican side. As it got stronger you began to get some Republicans elected. As they got elected you got more registered voters because now they could win sometimes. That means you&#x27;d get more party workers. That means you&#x27;d get better and better candidates. You can see the trend of a growing Republican Party and a two party south. The same thing that had led me to join Republicans in the first place I now saw, had come to learn, is a very important trend that I had been just a little part of. So I saw that growth was moving to the point where we could win. Holshouser won in 1972 but that was the year of Watergate but not the year after. So he won in 1972. Republicans took a whipping in 1974 and 1976. Jim Hunt was elected in 1976, I&#x27;d say on his own strength and re-elected. But Republicans were still hanging on pretty good. There looked like a reasonable chance that with an open seat, the Republican strength could assert itself better. So I saw that base giving me a chance to get close to where I could get over the finish line. The ability to advertise being the thing that could carry me further. Fleer:              Were there any issues or policy concerns that motivated you? Martin:           Not really. There were issues that were developed in the campaign; better schools in particular. Later on we expanded that, better schools, better roads, better jobs. But in the 1984 campaign education was an issue, tax cuts were a very good issue because they had surpluses that were being spent and I saw a great opportunity to give some of it back to the taxpayers. Those were issues that were developed. Highways I made a unique kind of issue which we can talk about later. For example, I didn&#x27;t promise everybody every highway and I was probably the first candidate for governor they&#x27;d ever heard of who didn&#x27;t promise everybody every highway and it got to be a joke. You know you&#x27;re going to have an election when you saw the little survey stakes along a dirt road. It didn&#x27;t mean you were going to get your road paved, it just meant you&#x27;re going to have an election. It was a joke. Everybody expected me to promise them every highway. I didn&#x27;t. I just promised 1-40. We would complete 1-40 and if I don&#x27;t promise anything else, then I&#x27;ve got a better chance of doing it. Jim Hunt had promised he would complete 1-40. He said he&#x27;d get it done in 10 years. Then he was out for 8 years. When he came back running again, he says he&#x27;s going to complete 1-40 in ten years. He just didn&#x27;t say which ten. So when I got in what I did was I said that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m going to promise and that way I can keep that promise and get it done. We&#x27;ve 34 got the bypass around Winston-Salem. We&#x27;ve got that extension from 1-95 all the way to Wilmington which everybody who had run for governor since Eisenhower started the interstate system had promised they&#x27;d get it done. Yet this is the only seaport on the East Coast that didn&#x27;t have a four lane highway going to it. Even Morehead City had U.S. 70 and Wilmington didn&#x27;t. So that was an issue but it wasn&#x27;t an issue that persuaded me to run. No, when I decided to run then I had to figure out what my issues would be and what I would deal with, what I wanted to do in the campaign and what I wanted to do with it if I was elected. Education was it. I saw this reverse, almost perverse, issue of roads because I knew I couldn&#x27;t out-promise the Democrats who had been there longer and knew all the roads. But if I couldn&#x27;t out-promise them maybe I could show that their promises were phony. When we got into the final with Edmisten, the way I stated this, I got better and better at this as I went along. I&#x27;d say, &quot;Look, I know that Edmisten has promised you the highways that you want. I know which highways they are. I can name them. If I was in Greenville, you want 264, you want 64 and you want 17 coming up through a little further to the east. Those are the roads of importance to you. I know Rufus Edmisten has promised you every road and I&#x27;m not going to promise them to you but think of it this way. He&#x27;s promised you everything, he&#x27;s promised everybody else everything. I&#x27;ve promised everybody else nothing. You&#x27;ve got just as good a chance of getting it from me as you do from him.&quot; See how you build that, add a new wrinkle on it every time. I started talking about unpaved promises and wouldn&#x27;t it be better- I&#x27;m not promising but you may get one of these roads and you may not. If you do, it&#x27;ll be unpromised paving. Isn&#x27;t that better than unpaved promises, all you&#x27;ve had before? And so it made an integrity issue out of it and really worked to my advantage because I did well in the East and everybody else in the state accepted 1-40 was a genuine strategy that made sense. If you&#x27;re going to finish 1-40, do it. It was strategically important to the whole state. Charlotte could say that&#x27;s not ours but it goes right by Statesville and it&#x27;s part of a connection of Charlotte up to here and to eastern parts of the state. You take 85 to Raleigh. But that was already built. Now later on in the end of that term I got into a real powerhouse of a political idea to build a network of four lane roads. We doubled the highway construction program. Fleer:              Strategic corridors. Martin:           Right. We called it &quot;Roads to the Future,&quot; strategic corridors. The Democrats and the legislature killed it off as quickly as they could because Bob Jordan was running. But that meant it was a good issue and so I used that as an issue in that campaign. But the issues didn&#x27;t really motivate me to run. I was not determined that I had to be your governor. Fleer:              I raise that question- 35 Martin:           But it was a way to cap my career. I express it in terms of leaving Congress but it was a solid conclusion to my career and put it on the line. So if I lost, that would be the end of the career and I&#x27;d try to find a way back into private life. I didn&#x27;t have an issue that drove me to run. Fleer:              I raise the matter of issues and, in a sense, by indirection, ideology because there were in the Republican Party during this time the beginnings, as some would say the continuation, of some ideological discussions and debates. Indeed in 1984 when you ran there was another race going on in North Carolina, Jesse Helms was running for re-election for his third term against Jim Hunt. Helms was identified with a more ideological component of the Republican Party. Can you talk a little bit about how that context influenced, if at all, your campaign and your ability to win. Martin:           It didn&#x27;t have anything to do with my decision to run but it was an important part of my campaign. When I first was elected to Congress, it was 1972 which was the year that Senator Helms was first elected to the Senate. While in the Congress he and I got along fine. His score on the Americans for Constitutional Action would be 100 or the American Conservative Union would be 100. Mine would be 80 or 85, maybe 90. The National Federation of Independent Business, that&#x27;d be a little higher because generally I believe in business. I&#x27;ve never was part of one. On the ACLU and AFL-CIO, CORE rating, he&#x27;d be a 0 and I&#x27;d be maybe a 10 or 15. But we were compatible. I have always believed that North Carolina has helped to balance the states that send the Metzenbaums and Kennedys and so forth to the United States Senate. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the fact that, however you look at it, that I was not as conservative as Senator Helms or, to put it another way, that he was more conservative that I. I teased him that the reason he got these perfect scores was because he got to write the questionnaire. That was in jest but there were some issues where we differed. I respect his contribution and he and I got along fine. So that when I decided to run for governor, a strange thing happened. His organization, the Congressional Club, the North Carolina Congressional Club, Tom Ellis was the head of that, Carter Wrenn, they tried to recruit somebody to run against me. They worked on Bill Colby to run against me. Bill was tempted and eventually backed away and didn&#x27;t run; but he had every right to run that I did. A very able administrator. I would say would be among the top two or three state administrators that I&#x27;m aware of. I&#x27;m more aware of North Carolina but I&#x27;ve met some in other places. He is an exceptional administrator. Remember he&#x27;d been athletic director at Chapel Hill before getting elected to one term in Congress. Fleer:              And he became a part of your administration. Martin:           Yea, that&#x27;s how I learned what a good administrator he is. He started off working 36 in Transportation as assistant to Jim Harrington. Harrington told us, &quot;we&#x27;ve got a pearl over here. This guy can move dirt. He can get it done. He works with people, he gets them to work.&quot; Later I promoted Bill to be the secretary of a new department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources. I wanted somebody who could pull all these pieces together. Environmental controls have been in several different departments. We cut it down to one plus agriculture because the farming part stayed there. But everything else we got in there. He was the kind of administrator who could make that work together. But he was recruited by them and would have been a formidable opponent. Again, if it was an open, nonpartisan race I figure I could win. But in a Republican primary they might have been tough but they backed off. Yet the senator and I were able to make peace. I figured and I think he figured the same way; I figured that if I was going to get elected, I needed to work with him. More of his voters were going to vote for me than the opposition, than his opponents. He must have felt the same way. While he had his own nucleus, he didn&#x27;t need me being damaged by the Republicans. You know those who weren&#x27;t satisfied with everything I did. So there was a nice accommodation in that campaign. In the real action, 1988,1 went directly to Tom Ellis and Carter Wrenn and asked them for their support and made clear that I would not ask them to manage a part of the campaign. I had my own style and my own approach but I did want them to be publicly identified on my side. To do that all I had to do was have a fund raising event at Tom&#x27;s house and those kinds of things. Putting out a newsletter, say something nice about me. Hold back on the criticism for a year. And they did it. They were supportive. Again, realizing that Republicans had gotten to the point where we were so strong that we could win because we had built this two-part coalition, the traditional Republicans and the religious conservatives. That was important to me and I didn&#x27;t want war with my senator for that reason. We got along fine personally and I think he felt the same way. We got along fine personally and he didn&#x27;t want war with me. So in that second campaign they did that, raised a little money but it&#x27;s just like anybody else having a house full of guests for a fundraiser. That set the word out that the team included me and my team included them. Fleer:              So there was an accommodation. In 1984 and 1988 there were issues raised which could have presented you with some difficulty because of these other-Martin:           Gasoline tax, for example. Fleer:              -these other things going on in the political context. You mentioned the gasoline tax. What other obstacles did you either side step or have to overcome? Martin:           Well, the biggest thing among the major issues that the senator and his supporters had was abortion. Here again they tolerated my view. They didn&#x27;t think it was sufficient but they didn&#x27;t oppose me on it. They tried to in 1984. Tried to recruit 37 Colby. When he didn&#x27;t they cast about trying to find somebody but that about-They ran out of time. The other issues were economical and like the tax. I would expect that Senator Helms himself would not vote for any such tax but I took the effort to make the point to him that I was going to propose this and it would take tax money to pay for it. The difference is you&#x27;d get something for your money. You&#x27;d get a road. And that everybody across the state would get their part of a network of four lane roads that go somewhere. That your products can get to market. You can&#x27;t recruit an industry to locate more than ten miles from an interstate highway. So if we had this network of four lane roads that connected the entire state to the highway system, then we&#x27;d have everybody improved economically. You could recruit. We found we couldn&#x27;t recruit folks- ... so I discussed that with them and asked them to just leave it alone. I know you&#x27;re not going to like this but it&#x27;s important for the state. If people are against it and you find that it&#x27;s irresistible to go for it. Leave it alone because I think people are going to like this because they get something for their money. Fleer:              So abortion and gasoline taxes. Anything else that you sort of had to side step or overcome in order to get elected in &#x27;84? Martin:           Well I didn&#x27;t side step the abortion. I followed the Lee Atwater rule. I answered the question-Fleer:              -Excuse me, I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that you had. Martin:           And on the highways I didn&#x27;t say how much the tax would be. I didn&#x27;t know. It turned out to be more than I thought it would because it&#x27;s a bigger program. We had to include secondary roads too. All unpaved dirt roads are included in that and that costs money. But I had planned a network of four lane intrastate highways and the beltways around the major cities. Then, in 1989, after the 1988 election we got it passed. That&#x27;s the right way to do things. Make it an issue, battle over it. If you win then get it done. That&#x27;s how we used that. Avery legitimate issue. But it wasn&#x27;t anything to side step because you can&#x27;t. You&#x27;re going to get asked and pressured and if you try to side step something then it&#x27;s like throwing chum in shark infested waters. Everybody&#x27;d . .. better to go ahead and deal with it as quick as you can and answer it and say, &quot;well, I answered that.&quot; Fleer:              When I look back over the 1984 and 1988 elections in which you were involved as candidate for governor, I see a couple of things. I see two very prominent Democrats who were your general election opponents; Rufus Edmisten and Robert Jordan. I also see that you didn&#x27;t have, at least on the ballot, any major opposition within the Republican party. You had none in 1988. You had modest opposition in 1984. 38 Martin:           I agree. Fleer:              Did you have any doubts at all that you were going to win these two elections? Martin:           A candidate can envision doubt, can intellectually deal with the evidence on which doubt could be based. But if you&#x27;re committed to winning your focus is not on doubt and the gloom and the doom. Your focus has to be on how to overcome a disadvantage. If you decide that a disadvantage is lethal, then you&#x27;re not going to be effective at doing anything that you do. Now that&#x27;s a little bit philosophical, a little bit psychological, speculative. When I ran for governor in 1984 I believed that I could win. I knew that a lot of people believed that I would not win. So I knew the basis of doubt. I knew they had doubt. I knew doubt was something we had to deal with to convince people that I could win. And you can&#x27;t convince them you can win by showing them evidence that you&#x27;re going to lose. Yet the evidence that we had was that I was behind Rufus Edmisten. I was behind Eddie Knox. I was behind John Ingram. I was behind all of them. But I could show that not all of them would be there. That was a legitimate argument to make to potential supporters. To show that you may favor, to Rusty Goode, you may favor Eddie Knox and if he and I are the nominees, you might as well go fishing or something. Just stay out of it. You&#x27;ve got a friend no matter what happens. But if he doesn&#x27;t make it, where are you going to go? If Knox doesn&#x27;t make it and Faircloth doesn&#x27;t make it and Green doesn&#x27;t make it, we got a chance. If two of those don&#x27;t make it we&#x27;ve got a chance because we can pick up some support. Those are the kind of indications I could give. As the campaign wore on into the first Democratic primary and, because I got through mine with Ruby, and the runoff primary and we built strength, my stock in the polls was coming up. I caught up with Edmisten about, I&#x27;d say about, two months before the election. Campaigns move fast toward the end and so it didn&#x27;t bother me that I caught him two months before the election, I figured we would. I figured all along there was a chance. We took a train trip in that campaign about three weeks before the election. There were two memorable, well three memorable things. One is the power and majesty of this locomotive coming down the track with a Dixieland band up there festooned with banners and bunting and sliding the lectern and talking to the crowds that our people had assembled to come. That&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s a beautiful part of campaigning. It&#x27;s a cheerleading aspect of campaigning. That was memorable. Second thing that was memorable was that we had caught him and had passed him but didn&#x27;t think he knew it. I talked in terms of looking down the tracks and seeing the two rails converge in the distance and that our polls have been doing this. That my strength had been below his but we had seen them getting closer and closer and converging. I could announce that as we speak here in this train station we have caught him and passed him. Now when you look down the horizon of the railroad track they don&#x27;t cross and go in opposite directions but here&#x27;s a little poetic license there. We could see them, they 39 converged and we crossed and passed him. A lot of my supporters had fun with that afterwards talking about tracks crossing. They&#x27;d flail their hands around just like I flailed mine around and talk about that. That was a memorable thing. It was a good theme because it showed momentum and growth and I&#x27;m sure that kind of thing helps to persuade end of Side A Tape 2 sideB Martin:           The third memorable event on that train trip was bizarre. We came in to Durham train station and there were reporters all over the place that we hadn&#x27;t seen before. That was exciting at first but I got word that they were asking my handlers in the area what I thought about a news conference that Rufus Edmisten had just had that day. I didn&#x27;t know anything about it. The story was that he had called the news conference to denounce me for having scumlously attacked his character by accusing him of boozing and womanizing. He had a letter on a copy of my campaign letterhead. It was the first page of what was a multi-page letter because it wasn&#x27;t signed at the bottom which was a clue.   It turned out, as to what was happening. We first misinterpreted it but it was a clue. This letter was addressed to the voters of Guilford County. The Republicans of Guilford County. It wasn&#x27;t addressed to any individual. It didn&#x27;t have a name blocked out. Just &quot;The Republicans of Guilford County.&quot; It made this very accusation. I knew our campaign was not doing that. We didn&#x27;t need to. The tracks had already crossed each other. We were ahead. Why would we be doing something stupid like this. My brother, Joe, is an English scholar and he said that that&#x27;s essentially what Willie Stark did in &quot;All the Kings Men.&quot; You remember the episode with the power company. He does a reverse smear. Accuses them of smearing his reputation. There may have been truthful in it but by accusing them of doing something bad he puts the burden on them. That was our answer. That Edmisten must be trying to do a reverse smear by accusing me of something that I would never do. We looked at the copy that they gave us and I said, &quot;If they&#x27;ve got the first page, why doesn&#x27;t he have the signature page? It must be because there isn&#x27;t any signature.&quot; Because we didn&#x27;t do it and whoever did it is up to mischief. It&#x27;s either somebody mischievously trying to do this. It&#x27;s not me. Or maybe he did it himself. We didn&#x27;t know. Of course he laughed and denied it. Of course when someone laughs and denies it you say &quot;why did he laugh and deny it?&quot; But Rufus just laughs. He&#x27;s a good natured guy. Turned out years later we found out and this has been published that one of our former campaign workers whom we had let go had done this to embarrass both me and Rufus. He admitted to it later and Rufus came to me and said, &quot;See, I knew you didn&#x27;t do that.&quot; 40 Fleer:              Happy ending anyway. Martin:           I wondered whether Brad had done that. Brad was so ingenious but why would he risk doing something that you didn&#x27;t have to do? I&#x27;ll give you another illustration of that. We had a campaign commercial that we developed in 1988 when Bob Jordan was running. Bob and I had become pretty good friends. He was lieutenant governor while I was there. He didn&#x27;t help me much but he helped me some. He immediately killed my first request to appear and give my state of the state address. When I proposed a constitutional amendment for the veto, he killed it immediately. Even Liston Ramsey, speaker of the house, let me have a hearing before he killed it. Jordan killed it right away and later said he was for it. Later supported it. The senate then adopted it with the house vote to its credit. But when I proposed the highway construction program with roads to the future, he saw to it that that was killed because he didn&#x27;t want me to run on that. I think he made a mistake because he gave me an issue. But as the campaign went along I&#x27;d always had the philosophy about attack ads. I would say first, if they&#x27;re true they&#x27;re not really false. If they differentiate my view from my opponent, I can&#x27;t say that that&#x27;s negative unless in his case he&#x27;s on the wrong side of the issue or if in my case I&#x27;m on the wrong side of the issue. You can be excessive, you can attack severely and I think it&#x27;s legitimate to attack. But my philosophy has been I&#x27;ll only approve an attack and after the third one from the other side. I&#x27;ll let it be known. You can attack me once, you can attack me twice but the third time you better duck because it&#x27;s coming back. We&#x27;d already had a couple of exchanges and Bobby had this funny little ad showing monkeys tumbling over on the desk. That hurt him because my budget officer whom he was portraying with those monkeys was Cliff Cameron who was a giant. Well respected. People who were supporting Bob Jordan who liked Cliff Cameron immediately were offended by that. It&#x27;s a good example of why you shouldn&#x27;t do stuff like that even though its funny. Very clever. But we developed an adjust incase. We never used it but it was a great ad. We called it &quot;Bambi&quot; and in this ad, I&#x27;ve got a copy of it at home, it&#x27;s never seen the airwaves, it directs attention to the fact that Bob Jordan has a lumber company that clear cuts trees. I wasn&#x27;t against clear cutting. But he was getting all this support of the environmentalists and he was a clear cutter. I didn&#x27;t have their support and I&#x27;d been doing a lot of things that I thought were beneficial for the environment dealing with the &quot;red tide&quot; issue, dealing with the Roanoke River sanctuary for wildlife which I personally got into that because it was going to die if I hadn&#x27;t. Working with the Nature Conservancy on various projects. But I didn&#x27;t do everything they wanted but it didn&#x27;t matter. They were for a Democrat and they were not going to be for a Republican. I had this ad. I was going to tweak him. If he hit me one more time with an ad he was going to see this thing and it would be painful for him because here&#x27;s what happened. In &quot;Bambi&quot; it opens up with a Sylvan theme, right? Nice woodsy area. Little animals, 41 butterflies. You can hear the opening theme of William Tell Overture, [humming tune] And right at that point you hear a chainsaw crank up and then it all breaks loose. Our crew had been out in one of his forests and saw one of his crews, Jordan Company there on the side of the truck. They were stopping for a coffee break and then our crew set up the camera. These people thought it was some kind of news organization and they said, &quot;Would you like for us to crank up some of the equipment?&quot; &quot;No, go ahead and finish your coffee. We&#x27;ll set up in a little bit.&quot; In a little bit then they cranked up the equipment that rips a tree out of the ground. We didn&#x27;t quite finish this but our plan was to have a primal scream on the sound track accompanying the ripping of this tree out of the ground. That was Bambi. We never used that because he gave up at the end and didn&#x27;t show any more ads. We_________. It was a classic and it hadn&#x27;t seen the light of day. Fleer:              That&#x27;s too bad. Martin:           I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to. I chuckle every time during the campaign when he&#x27;d be talking to me and he&#x27;d accuse me of something. I&#x27;d hold up one finger and say there&#x27;s one. Then later on he&#x27;d make some strong accusation and I&#x27;d say &quot;two. One to go. You better duck.&quot; We just ran out of time. Fleer:              We have many aspects I&#x27;m sure of the campaign that we could explore but I want to assume that you have been elected- Martin:           -campaigns are going to be rough and tumble. If they&#x27;re not, if you sanitize campaigns then I would predict that you&#x27;re not going to get the best people elected. If campaigns are too brutal, you&#x27;re not going to get the best people to even run. If they&#x27;re sanitized and subject to all kinds of rules and regulations, then who you get elected is not going to have anything to do with who can do the best job for the public. I believe that. So you&#x27;ve got to be a little bit rough and tumble. You&#x27;ve got to be able to take and you&#x27;ve got to be able to give. And you&#x27;ve got to debate issues and when you debate issues and say this is what I believe and my opponent does not, my opponent believes the other. I think you&#x27;re entitled to say that and your opponent then, if you&#x27;re wrong, is entitled to show that you misrepresented his or her view. That&#x27;s his responsibility and his opportunity if you misrepresented him. That&#x27;s a golden opportunity for him to whack you for misrepresenting him. But if he can&#x27;t defend it and if indeed he is on the wrong side of the issue and you can keep him focused on that topic, that&#x27;s to your advantage and you ought to do it. I&#x27;ve seen it in the Vinroot campaign. In the primary he got put on the defensive on the abortion issue because he made a campaign contribution to Family Planning. I didn&#x27;t know Family Planning was doing abortions. He said he didn&#x27;t. I believe him. I knew they were tolerant of it and coached people about it and advised them how to do it but by keeping him focused on that issue his campaign couldn&#x27;t get back on track. So anytime you get 42 your opponent off track fine, do it. But if they can defend their position then they can make you pay a heavy price for having done that. Campaigns should be aggressive and rough and tumble and they&#x27;ve got to be expensive because that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to get your message across. That&#x27;s the end of the campaign. Now you want to talk about- Fleer:              It&#x27;s obvious you enjoy campaigning. You&#x27;ve thought a lot about it. Obviously one of the important components of campaigning is getting the support of the people. That&#x27;s an important component also of being governor. Not only getting their support but maintaining their support. So what I&#x27;d like to do in the next series of questions is to talk about the role of the governor as a public leader. Governor, how were you able to determine what it is that the people of North Carolina wanted you to do as governor? Martin:           Communication&#x27;s a two way street and mostly I&#x27;d been talking about issues, themes or episodes where I described how I conveyed my point about it. But the opposite of that, the reverse of that two way street, is the public&#x27;s input into the system. There are a lot of ways to do that. The ultimate way is how they cast their vote. If you, as a candidate, have campaigned on several major themes and you&#x27;re elected, you&#x27;re entitled to conclude that your election gives you the authority and the expectation to try to do what you said you were going to do on your main themes. Some people say that they&#x27;re therefore entitled to do anything they want to do. I don&#x27;t think that because you&#x27;re not mandated to do things you never campaigned on that you didn&#x27;t reveal to the voters. I campaigned on schools.   Was elected. I was entitled to do what I could for schools and put that as a first priority and try to do something with it. So the election process itself gets you a message. I campaigned on the highway expansion program. I initiated that debate but was elected. That was the public saying we&#x27;re not against that. You go ahead and do that. So the election, I&#x27;m trying to say, is a powerful message from the public. If they vote you down, then of course you&#x27;re not going to get to do what you want to do and the person who wins is probably not going to carry out something that you campaigned on that he didn&#x27;t if he wins. Now in addition to that you&#x27;ve got public opinion polling that in this day and time is widespread. It only gets an answer to the questions that you ask. Part of being smart is learning how to ask a question so that you can discern something useful out of it. To me a public opinion poll is much more important as information about what the public feels and wants and likes and dislikes than it is as a marketing device. Other campaigns would report their polling results to show that they were on top of the world, that they&#x27;re hanging on by a thread, whatever, to show they were winning. We never did that. We didn&#x27;t do it in the congressional campaigns. We didn&#x27;t do it in the campaign for governor until the last minute. Just as the last thing and it was all over and there was nothing else we could do with that information. We released information that we passed him a month ago 43 and that was devastating. But we didn&#x27;t release information before. It&#x27;s more important to find out what the trend is. How do people feel about railroads? How do people feel about highways? How do people feel about paving dirt roads? How do people feel about public school? Details, the SAT test, are they fixated on that or not? How do they feel about the disruption of school by misbehaving students, an inability of the schools to discipline them. How do they feel about school assignments? About the size of the school? About the text materials. About how their student is doing? When you ask a lot of questions- But if you get too spread out on one subject like education then you&#x27;re not learning much about health so you&#x27;ve got to ask some different kind of questions about environment, about health, about transportation, about prisons, about crime. Crime is a big issue. About taxes. Fleer:              How often would you and your- Martin:           You ask them would you spend, you as the voters, Would you spend tax money on this? Would you increase taxes to ... for example, to provide merit pay for teachers? You know people like merit pay, performance based compensation incentives. You know they don&#x27;t like to pay more taxes. You give them a choice. You do those kinds of things. From that you learn several things. One, you learn how the public feels about it if you&#x27;ve had really good questions. You learn how they feel about important questions. Not going to learn anything about what you didn&#x27;t ask. Second, you learn where they&#x27;re in agreement with you which gives you an area that might be a good issue if your opponent has strayed off from that. Third, you learn where you&#x27;ve got a problem. Where there&#x27;s an issue that could hurt you. Now there&#x27;s two ways to deal with that.   One is to avoid it as much as you can. The other is to try to educate them. I know when I was in Congress I learned that the public was furious about gasoline prices going up and didn&#x27;t want to hear my explanations about what was causing that, that it was as much dealing with controls as well as the oil embargo and those kinds of things. It was not because ships were turned around out in the ocean and waiting on the price to go up before they&#x27;d come in. Those ships that were leaving had already discharged their cargo. The ones sitting out there on anchor was because there wasn&#x27;t any room at the dock. I was on a committee that could look into that. I knew that people weren&#x27;t accepting that and I chose to keep hammering the same theme and explain it because it was rational. It was based on evidence that was sound. The polls told me that I was way behind on that in the beginning and they told me when I caught up and when I was beginning to persuade my constituency. Even though the majority of the country stayed on the other side because their congressman didn&#x27;t try to help them see it. So that&#x27;s how polls can be useful. Now that&#x27;s input from people. You get a lot of mail. When I was in Congress, I signed every response and I wanted a letter back to somebody the next day.</dc:description>

<dc:description>184 INTERVIEW 12 July 30, 1997 FRANCES WEAVER: This is an interview with Dr. Henry Toole Clark, first administrator of Health Affairs at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The interview is taking place in Dr. Clark&#x27;s home in Carol Woods in Chapel Hill. It is July 30,1997. My name is Frances Weaver. Henry, in our last discussion you described some of the long range planning which you had initiated which would double the sizes of the teaching, research and patient care programs of Health Affairs by 1970, that&#x27;s from their 1957 levels. Near the end of our chat you also stated that in the late spring of 1963 both Dean Berryhill and Chancellor Aycock had indicated that they planned to resign their positions in mid-1964. Please pick up the Health Affairs story from where we left it off there. HENRY TOOLE CLARK:     Fran, on May 15,1963,1 received a copy of a long letter and considerable amplifying material from Reece Berryhill to Bill Aycock which indicated that Reece planned to resign as Dean, effective June 30,1964; that was later changed to Aug. 31,1964. A short time later, on June 22, 1963,1 received a penned note from Bill Aycock that he had tendered his resignation as Chancellor, which would also become effective August 31,1964. These two actions put into motion a chain of events which would lead to the appointment of Ike Taylor as Dean of Medicine and Paul Sharp as Chancellor, both effective September 1, 1964. There were some difficult days, however, in the interval between the notices of the two resignations and the assumption of new positions by Taylor and Sharp. In submitting his resignation, Berryhill reiterated and expanded on his earlier, often repeated contention with regard to the primacy of Medicine in the Health Affairs constellation. He vigorously stated that his school had managed to develop a top quality program despite the handicaps presented by being a part of a restrictive Division of Health Affairs structure. He identified the main obstacles which the School of Medicine, in general, and he, as Dean, had faced had been (a) an unsympathetic Division administrator, (b) a Division Board which was biased against the School of Medicine but nevertheless was called upon to review and advise on all significant program developments in that School, and (c) a University Administration which was, at times, indifferent to the concerns of his school. He disparaged the programs of the other schools in the Division stating, among other things, that &quot;Medicine, fundamentally an academic discipline, deeply resents now and will always resent relegation to a group of vocational training schools ..&#x27;.&quot;. He stated that he doubted that the University could obtain a new Dean of any quality in view of the organizational and operating limitations he would face. He urged, as he had proposed during the administrative turmoil of 1955-56, that the University Administration remove the School of Medicine, the main Hospital and Psychiatric Center plus the Gravely Sanitarium from the Division of Health Affairs and designate them as the UNC Medical Center with the Dean of the Medical School also serving as Director of the Center. Ed McGavran, John Brauer and Betty Kemble soon became aware of BerryhiU&#x27;s further derogatory remarks about their programs and they responded by stating, in sharp terms, that Berryhill simply exaggerated some of the problems he reported, that he himself was responsible for others and that he really spoke only for his inner circle who were a minority of his faculty while the majority resented his overbearing attitude. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 185 Chancellor Aycock largely ignored all of this, and he took no action to review the administrative structure of the Division of Health Affairs which Berryhill had requested. On the other hand, he acknowledged with good grace Reece&#x27;s plan to resign, cited his long years of service to the University and his leadership role in building the School of Medicine, agreed to provide him a year&#x27;s leave of absence with full pay from the point of his resignation and then to welcome him back to the Medical faculty with an appropriate appointment and salary until the time of his ultimate retirement. Reece was age sixty-three in 1963; the retirement age for faculty members in those days was seventy. All these negotiations took place between Aycock and Berryhill in private, though no doubt with Bill Friday&#x27;s full approval. I was not involved in the discussions even though the Trustee approved &quot;Health Affairs Code&quot; indicated I should play an active role. I was deeply concerned about this because I had hoped that Berryhill&#x27;s retirement as Dean would be followed by an era of good will and team play in Health Affairs. I thought this was unlikely if Berryhill stayed on as ex-Dean and senior professor and took a new Dean under his wing, as he was almost certain to do. I was even more disturbed when, in keeping with Berryhill&#x27;s request, Aycock personally appointed the search committee for a new Dean of the Medical School. The Administrator of Health Affairs was assigned this function under the Code, and the procedure outlined in the Code had been followed with good results in the recent search for a Dean of the School of Public Health. Berryhill had contended to Aycock that the School of Medicine faculty would have no respect for any actions that I took in this matter. In my judgment, many, and quite possibly a majority of the medical faculty would have welcomed the possibility of a new dean from the &quot;outside&quot; who would have created a whole new operating atmosphere in the School. But this was not to be. I protested to Aycock the &quot;ad hoc&quot; procedure which he followed, but to no avail. A nine member search committee was activated in the fall of 1963 with six faculty members of the School of Medicine, plus Don Anderson of the Consolidated University office, John Brauer and me as members. Chuck Burnett, Chairman of the Department of Medicine, was appointed Chairman. Chuck subsequently developed a serious illness and was succeeded by Ken Brinkhaus as Chairman. The committee worked actively for the next six months, considering about one hundred prospects and interviewing a few. At about mid-point in its deliberations the committee reached a consensus on Bill Hubbard, a native North Carolinian and graduate ofUNC, who was Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Michigan and, I think, also President of the Association of American Medical Colleges at the time. After being approached and giving the matter some consideration, Hubbard withdrew his name from consideration. There was no dearth of good candidates, however, and this refuted Reece&#x27;s contention that our Health Affairs organizational structure would be a deterrent. As the selection process went forward and the list of prime prospects narrowed, an interesting thing happened from my standpoint. The two top choices came down to Ike Taylor, a young Markle Scholar member of our own Department of Medicine, and Len Fenninger, a very bright Associate Dean of Medicine at the University of Rochester who was also, at the time, Director of the Strong Memorial Hospital. Len paid a visit and made an excellent impression during a series of interviews. In my judgment, he had the fresh ideas, drive, leadership capacity and warmth of personality we needed, and we could not have found a better man for our Dean. I do not know who had nominated Len for the Deanship, but the Committee did not realize that Len and his wife, Jane, had been the Clarks&#x27; best friends at Rochester over a three year period in the 1940&#x27;s. Indeed, Jane was a Godmother for our first child, Laura, who was born in Rochester. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 186 When the fact of our friendship became known, this dampened the enthusiasm of the School of Medicine members of the committee for Len. Ike Taylor, the local candidate, became the &quot;safe&quot; choice, despite his administrative inexperience. The vote in the Committee was five to three for Ike. The militant minority of the Medical School had won out. Though he had a less abrasive personality than Reece, Ike, as Dean, was to prove just as strong an opponent of the Division structure and just as severe a critic of me, personally, as was Berryhill. FW:     Henry, that is a fascinating story. I would be interested, too, in your observations about the selection of Paul Sharp as Chancellor. HC:     I really was not involved in that in any way and I don&#x27;t recall even meeting Paul Sharp until after he took office as Chancellor on September 1,1964. However, I was, of course, deeply interested in having a person chosen for that position with whom I could work constructively. The fact is, I thought Alex Heard, the Dean of our Graduate School, would have made an outstanding Chancellor. As I have previously indicated, Alex shared an office suite with me in South Building for several years and I was privy to the information that, during the period when the search for a Chancellor for UNC was going on, Alex was considering approaches from both Vanderbilt and Rochester to be Chancellor. Since my own academic career had included stints at both these institutions, Alex used me as a sounding board for some of his reflections. I think he made the choice to go to Vanderbilt in the midst of the UNC search. In view of the subsequent spectacular career Alex had at Vanderbilt and on the national educational scene, and what I feel was the unfortunate experience UNC had with Paul Sharp, Bill Friday missed a huge opportunity for UNC by not pursuing Alex Heard with vigor for our Chancellorship. FW:     I certainly agree. Alex would have made a superb chancellor, or president, for that matter. But let&#x27;s get back to Health Affairs and what was happening there while these personnel changes were going on. HC:     Fran, there were several developments during 1963-64 which had important long term implications: First, the 1963 North Carolina General Assembly appropriated $2,500,000 toward the very important Ambulatory Patient Care Facility which was in the advanced planning stages. The total cost of that facility was tentatively estimated at $7,500,000, but with $2,500,000 in hand, there were excellent prospects for obtaining the rest of the money from federal sources. Second, the 1903 General Assembly also authorized the appointment of a Medical Center Study Commission to consider the feasibility of establishing a medical center &quot;for training doctors, nurses, technicians and other personnel in Charlotte or some other North Carolina location&quot;. Both Dr. Berryhill and I were asked to be members of the nine man commission which would be chaired by William Henderson, the Executive Director of the North Carolina Medical Care Commission. I do not know the roots of this Legislative action but its importance increased during the next few years. Third, during 1962 and extending well into 1963 Chancellor Aycock activated a substantial self-study of the Main Campus programs at UNC, looking toward creating a report which would serve as the starting point for an accreditation visit by a team representing the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. That team visit was ultimately made during March 1964. In organizing the UNC self-study, Chancellor Aycock recognized that Health Affairs had carried out a major self-study during 1957-58, with the advice and assistance of a distinguished committee of national consultants, and that this study had been updated in 1960-61 as a basis for definitive architectural planning. He, therefore, decided against having Health Affairs repeat that enormous exercise in 1962-63 but chose, instead, to present a historical review of the earlier report in the advance CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 187 materials which were sent to the Southern Association Visiting Committee. He anticipated that the Visiting Committee would focus its visit on the main campus and give only token attention to Health Affairs. The Southern Association Committee made its accreditation visit in March 1964 and its report was available to Chancellor Sharp when he took office on September 1, 1964. Fourth, on March 9 and 10,1964 the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education made a periodic accreditation visit and shortly thereafter it issued a report that was quite critical of the School of Pharmacy in several respects. It cited tensions and problems within the faculty as having a disruptive influence, noted that the curriculum and educational programs should be studied and revised, and stated that the University should address these matters or otherwise show cause why accreditation should not be withdrawn. All this led, in due time, to the resignation of Dean Brecht; the appointment of John Larsh of the School of Public Health as Interim Dean; the activation of a search committee under the chairmanship of Professor Tom Christopher of the School of Law; and eventually, to the appointment of George Hager as Dean of the School of Pharmacy. Fifth, beyond these highlights, the normal workings of Health Affairs went on. There was fresh urgency to complete planning for the Ambulatory Care Facility in the light of the State appropriation of $2,500,000 for this purpose and by the passage by Congress of Public Law 88-129 in 1963, the Education for the Health Professions Act, which was expected to provide most of the needed matching money. Furthermore, planning was also required for several other School of Medicine elements, as we have previously discussed. Sixth, related to all this, I completed my term of office as a member of the U.S. Public Health Service General Clinical Research Center Committee in early 1964 and moved on immediately to a position on the National Advisory Council for Public Law 88-129. My most important early contribution to the workings of that Council was to gain concurrence that all applications be required to show evidence of substantial advance medical center planning in presenting their requests for funds. This would not only help to assure that realistic cost estimates would be submitted for the proposed projects but also that all appropriate local points of view would have been considered in preparing the grant requests. This, in turn, would mean that once the grants were made the facilities could be built with fewer unexpected space demands that required costly change orders and delays. I felt confident that our own UNC grant requests would satisfy the criteria established because of the extensive advance planning we had already carried on or, otherwise, was in process. FW:     Henry, as Bill Aycock left office did he reflect on the administrative problems and opportunities he was leaving behind? What were those last months of his administration like? HC:     Fran, at the regular meeting of the Trustees Health Affairs Committee on May 11, 1964 Chairman Hill noted that this was the last scheduled meeting of the Committee prior to Chancellor Aycock&#x27;s retirement as Chancellor. He invited Aycock to comment on any matters he wished but particularly with regard to his current thoughts about the organizational structure of the Division of Health Affairs. The Chancellor reminded the group that he had been active in 1955 in developing the &quot;Code&quot; of Health Affairs by assembling and organizing all the &quot;Rules, Regulations and Policy&quot; that had been approved by the Trustees. He stated that during the 1955-56 year the chief concerns of the clinical faculty were related to the administration of the Hospital, whereas the prime concern of the Dean was related to the administrative organization. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 188 Aycock stated further that during the eight year period since the formalization of policy in 1956, the Dean and a few members of the Medical faculty had persisted in expressing their displeasure with the position of the School of Medicine in the Division of Health Affairs. However, the Chancellor stated that, after considerable reflection, it was his judgment that the current administrative structure was more feasible than any alternate he could envision. Moreover, he stated that although the Division Board had been the principal target of some dissenters, he felt this Board was necessary as a coordinating agency for the five schools concerned. He considered the Division Board to be effective rather than the alleged handicap. He noted that there had been no appeals from recommendations by the Division Board or rulings by the Division Administrator during his seven years as Chancellor, though there was a clear mechanism for such appeals, if desired. He stated, in addition, that the School of Medicine was, under the existing administrative structure, as close to the center of decision making as any school in the University, adding that it was more difficult to get business done in Academic Affairs than in Health Affairs. In summary, he endorsed the continued organization and functioning of the Division of Health Affairs as it currently existed. All this is amplified in the minutes of the Trustees Health Affairs Committee of May 11, 1964, Fran. FW:    I see. HC:     During the summer of 1964 there was an undercurrent of expectancy and uncertainty in administrative circles among Bill Aycock&#x27;s team in South Building as they looked toward Paul Sharp&#x27;s assumption of the Chancellorship on September 1, 1964. However, there was necessarily a heavy focus on the preparation of budget requests which would be considered by the 1965-67 General Assembly. Almost all of the basic decisions would be made and preliminary discussions held with the State Department of Administration and the Advisory Budget Commission before Sharp officially took over. My chief concern in this regard was to get requests for funds for the Basic Science Facility, the new School of Dentistry and the new School of Nursing into the UNC capital budget request with high priority and strong administrative endorsement. This would make the overall UNC capital budget request for 1965-67 heavily weighted toward Health Affairs, and Berryhill was critical because he felt the inclusion of facilities for both Dentistry and Nursing would dilute and weaken the appeal for Medicine. However, in my view, there were some practical and tactical reasons for seeking all three. We were beginning to have considerable success in gaining provisional approval of our requests for federal construction grants through Public Law 88-129 and other sources and, in my judgment, we could expect more approvals by the time the legislature convened in January 1965. However, all of these federal grants were contingent on matching appropriations from the State and there was a time limit during which that matching must occur. This would create a sense of urgency for state legislative approval. In addition to this, I was betting that Elizabeth Scott Carrington was going to be successful in her campaign to obtain state matching funds for the new School of Nursing. I was successful in pressing my case and our UNC capital budget request included all three Health Affairs elements. One of the nice things that happened as Aycock moved toward retiring as Chancellor was that he took special recognition of each of his senior staff members, I think, in one way or another. Jim Godfrey, for example, who was my counterpart on the Main Campus, was nominated for a Kenan Professorship as he moved back to a position in the Department of History. I was given a $2,500 increase in salary, which was a generous increase at that time. That was important to me as CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 189 a show of appreciation for my work because there had not been much of that since the days of House and Teague almost a decade earlier. My new salary, incidentally, was $26,000, which was less than that paid to many senior faculty members, including Deans, in our Schools of Medicine and Dentistry. FW:     Henry, could you talk a little about Bill Aycock as you knew him, please? HC:     Fran, I had the highest respect and considerable personal affection for Bill Aycock but I was never one of his close confidants, if indeed he had any. In my view, he was a very &quot;private&quot; guy who kept his own counsel, measured each new situation in his thorough analytical way, and took action in a positive, straight-forward manner. He was not an imaginative and innovative chancellor and I never felt he had any real agenda of his own. He seemed to feel-much like Chancellor House-that his role was to preside over a vast and complex organization which was growing rapidly during his term in office and to keep the wheels turning effectively. He was sensitive to larger social and community issues but not an activist, such as Frank Graham, in addressing them. I felt he was more of a traditionalist than a liberal, and wondered how he viewed the early tug-of-war in the School of Law which led to Albert Coates going outside the University to activate what eventually became The Institute of Government. Similarly, I never really learned how he felt about the merits of the Sanger vision that Health Affairs should be developed as &quot;a service facility for the whole state.&quot; I felt Bill was quite willing to give me free rein to try to persuade the Medical Dean and faculty to take more substantive steps to implement the Sanger vision but he did not provide me any personal help or advice in this connection. Bill Aycock&#x27;s best friend was, no doubt, Bill Friday and I think Aycock&#x27;s commitment to help Friday fulfill his own dreams as UNC President was a dominant factor in his functioning. Fran, while Bill Aycock addressed his work as Chancellor with zest and enthusiasm, I really don&#x27;t think he was happy in his work. His functioning was complicated at mid-point in his Chancellorship when his lovely wife, Grace, was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. Grace gradually developed increasing physical limitations from that unfortunate disease. Much later, Bill himself, was hospitalized in January 1965 with a bleeding peptic ulcer which required multiple blood transfusions and several weeks of convalescence. This may very well have been a delayed pay-off from the constant tensions associated with his seven years as Chancellor. One thing more, I have learned that Bill was a superb teacher in the School of Law and I can well understand that this was the case. I think that role produced Bill&#x27;s greatest satisfactions. FW:     Yes, that&#x27;s true, I think. What about Paul Sharp who succeeded him? What were your initial impressions of him? HC:     Sharp took office as Chancellor on September 1,1964. Paul had come to his new post from a position as President of Hiram College, a small liberal arts college in the midwest. I was somewhat apprehensive about the fact that he had had little or no previous experience with Health Affairs programs or with the operation of a university the size and complexity of UNC in Chapel Hill. I hoped he would seek me out and we could have a series of orientation discussions, much like those I had with Watts Hill several years earlier. I wanted especially to discuss with him the vision of the Sanger Report. I thought, too, our discussions would help establish the basis for a warm professional and personal working relationship. Unfortunately, no such discussions occurred. As the days went by, it seemed to me to be the &quot;neighborly&quot; thing to do to invite the Sharp family to have dinner in our home. I thought this would give all of us a chance to get better acquainted in a relaxed, private setting. Unfortunately, the day had been a stressful one for both the Sharps and the Clarks and the evening together did not produce the understanding and good will I had sought. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 190 A week or two later an incident occurred which had some ominous overtones. I dropped by Sharp&#x27;s office briefly to say that a staff member of one of the granting agencies in Washington with whom I had worked on a site visit team had suggested a possible source of substantial funds for one of our Health Affairs projects. I indicated I planned to visit Washington shortly to get more information with which to prepare a grant request. I anticipated that I would report to Chancellor Sharp the results of this trip later on and use that occasion to open up the substantial dialogue with him which I wanted. However, as the day of the trip approached my secretary relayed a message from Sharp&#x27;s secretary that Sharp wanted me to take Ike Taylor, the new Medical Dean, with me on my trip. This seemed a strange request to me because Sharp was the only one who knew I was going to Washington and I felt he had told Ike. It appeared that out-of-channels communication between the Chancellor and the School of Medicine was already established and my own leadership role was being preempted. An even more ominous incident occurred in mid-November when Sharp sent me some selected passages from the Report of the Visiting Committee of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and asked for my comment. Among other things, those passages contained the following statement: &quot;The unhappy gulf existing between the Divisions of Academic Affairs and Health Affairs should be bridged as quickly and as effectively as possible, in fact as in spirit. To this end, the responsibilities and functions of the Dean of the Faculty and the Administrator of Health Affairs should be combined in one office entitled Vice Chancellor of the University who would be assisted by an Assistant Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs and an Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.&quot; I commented at length on the selected passages, and indeed on the whole of the Southern Association Report, in a letter of December 26,1964, a copy of which is among my library papers. In my letter I cited the facts, as we discussed earlier, that Aycock had felt the extensive self-study and projection activities carried out by Health Affairs in the late 1950&#x27;s and early 1960&#x27;s with the aid of a distinguished national panel of Health Affairs experts was all the &quot;self-study&quot; that could reasonably be expected of Health Affairs; and he did not anticipate the SAC Visiting Committee would make more than a token examination of Health Affairs. However, having been a member of two recent Southern Association Visiting Committees, that is, to the University of Florida and to the Medical College of Virginia, I had urged that the Executive Director of Southern Association, Gordon Sweet, be asked to appoint one senior member of the committee coming to UNC who was well informed about Health Affairs programs. As it turned out, there was no one on that committee who could speak with experience for Health Affairs matters in their committee discussions. My full concerns in this regard, and much more, are presented in my letter of December 26, 1964, which is in the Library. The next step in the disintegration of my close ties with UNC came in January 1965 when Mac Norwood accepted an offer to become the Financial Officer and Business Manager of the Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia at about double the salary he was being paid at UNC. Mac was my most effective working partner at UNC and he was held in high regard by everyone who knew him. His loss would be devastating to my functioning and to all of Health Affairs. His salary at UNC was pegged far too low by state regulations for classified personnel. In a moment of inspiration, in an attempt to retain his services, I gained Sharp&#x27;s and Branch&#x27;s concurrence to offer CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 191 him a position as Assistant Administrator of Health Affairs with a major increase in salary. Mac wanted to fly on his own, however, and he decided to leave for Philadelphia on April 1,1965. My own high opinion of Mac&#x27;s ability and leadership qualities was validated several years later when he was asked to serve as the Acting President of the Jefferson Medical Center for two years while a search committee for a new president was at work. The next step in this saga occurred one day in late February 1965 when Esther Shelton, my secretary, came into my office, closed the door and said quietly: &quot;There is something strange going on down the hall. All of the Health Affairs Deans are in the Chancellor&#x27;s reception room and they are going into his office, one by one, for about ten minutes and then leaving the building.&quot; The mystery was cleared up very quickly when John Brauer telephoned to say that, in a brief meeting, just concluded, Chancellor Sharp had told him that he had plans to reorganize his administrative staff effective July 1,1965 to create a single Vice Chancellor of the University, Carlyle Sitterson, which would combine the functions and eliminate the positions of Dean of the Faculty and Administrator of Health Affairs, then held respectively by Sitterson and me. Brauer indicated he was dismayed by this turn of events and he thought Mayes, Kemble and Brecht were, too, but he felt Sharp was firm in his decision. FW:     Henry, how in the world did you react to such a communication from John Brauer? Wasn&#x27;t that an unusual way for a chancellor to reshape his administrative staff? HC:     Yes, Fran, it certainly was. Two or three days later, on March 1,1965,1 sought and had a conference with Chancellor Sharp himself. I told him quietly that I had learned of his reorganization plan and I was deeply hurt that the information had come from a subordinate rather than the Chancellor himself. I stated, further, that as a new Chancellor he should have the privilege of choosing his own immediate staff, but that some personal consideration should be given to a graceful transition for a staff member who had served the University for fifteen years with the full endorsement of two previous chancellors, including a recent substantial salary increase. I indicated that if he had approached me personally to state his wishes and plans I would have been quite understanding. I said I would try to be helpful now, though with a very empty feeling. I indicated that I had one special request of him, that he recommend and help me obtain a one year&#x27;s leave of absence, with full salary, from the University which would give him the freedom he needed to implement his program without consideration for personalities and give me the time to consider next steps in my own professional career and personal life. Chancellor Sharp seemed completely taken aback by my remarks and indeed, he seemed to struggle to make any response at all. I excused myself after a short interval. When I did not hear anything at all from Chancellor Sharp for several days I approached him once more and requested that we meet again, though this time with President Friday to discuss my request for a leave. That meeting took place on March 9 in the Chancellor&#x27;s office with Syd Alexander also present. I explained at the outset that Syd was not a part of my presentation but that his own personal and professional future were in question as a part of the organizational changes being proposed by Chancellor Sharp and I wanted him to be aware, first hand, of our discussion. I then repeated, for Bill Friday&#x27;s benefit, the details of my earlier presentation to Sharp, including the request for the leave of absence. I added that my fifteen years spent in overseeing the activation of Health Affairs had been an intense and often frustrating experience for both me and my family and we needed a period of time to &quot;recharge our batteries&quot; as well as serve the other purposes cited. I stated further that though I had had frequent requests in the past for consulting CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 192 services, I did not have anything special on my desk at that point, so I did not know how the leave would be spent. Friday made no comment on Sharp&#x27;s plan for reorganization though he must have endorsed it before Sharp took steps to inform the Health Affairs Deans. Friday agreed to request authorization for my leave from the next meeting of the Board of Trustees which would occur in early May. One other major piece of this story occurred on March 23,1965 in the form of a letter from Mac Norwood to Chancellor Sharp as Mac was taking leave of Chapel Hill for his new job in Philadelphia. I recognize this letter is very supportive of me personally, but the comments by Mac about the obstacles I experienced in carrying out a huge work assignment at UNC for fifteen years and some of the contributions I made despite those obstacles are essentially correct. The factors which Mac discusses are pertinent for the full understanding of the &quot;Health Affairs Story&quot; and I want to make his full letter a part of my interview now. FW:     That&#x27;s a good idea, Henry. Why don&#x27;t you just read it onto the tape. HC:     Fran, the letter is dated March 23, 1965 and it is addressed to Chancellor Sharp and it reads as follows: The one fear that I have as I prepare to leave for Philadelphia next week is that a tragic mistake will be made about Henry Clark. While no person in authority has told me, it is not difficult to learn that Dr. Clark&#x27;s future role in this University is in great doubt, indeed, that he may be sacrificed in a new plan of organization. The purpose of this letter is to point out how great a sacrifice this would be. Here is a brilliant man of complete dedication to this University and this state, who has accomplished miracles, real miracles over obstacles that would have-and have-defeated lesser men many years ago. As your future unfolds in Chapel Hill, Mr. Chancellor, I sincerely hope that you too can fulfill your mission in spite of the lethargy and obstructionism which you will encounter here. Dr. Clark&#x27;s troubles started when he arrived, perhaps even before that. You are familiar with these problems, and their results, both the individual events and the cumulative effect. So what has he done? He has exercised complete restraint for fifteen years. He has not retaliated once that I know of while one very powerful man has used every means at his disposal, written and spoken, to destroy his career, and his character, and those in authority have sat silent. During that period he has created, with very little support from his superiors, an environment in which each dean of each school-save one-in his Division was enabled to build from scratch a program of national stature. He has constantly challenged, and pushed, and led every one of these schools to rise above itself, to set higher goals, to achieve more than even its own leaders thought possible. It would be possible to recount innumerable examples, but let me trace the development of just one. In 1957, Dr. Clark alone conceived and pushed through the self-evaluation and the national study committee. He received little encouragement from above or below, until the Board of Higher Education coincidentally demanded that the job be expanded to the whole University. Subsequently, the idea of an organized program of planning for physical development was his alone. His personal initiative was entirely responsible for the creation of Turtle&#x27;s office. He pressed for a Health Affairs planning office, and later his idea was converted to a University-wide program. He forced the issue of the employment of Souder. He encouraged Souder CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 193 to complete his work in spite of the perpetual sabotage of the School of Medicine and the generally lukewarm attitude of everyone except a few like John Brauer. After he was forced to lose Souder, he encouraged the employment of Wheeler, who, with the participation of the Medical School, attempted to develop schemes different from Souder&#x27;s but who eventually proposed the present Ambulant Patient Care Facility about like Souder envisioned it. Everyone thought Clark was crazy to push for the basic science, the dental, and the nursing projects in 1965. Look where we are now. I need not go on. I am well aware of Dr. Clark&#x27;s faults. I have heard them enumerated endlessly, and indeed I have catalogued them myself. They all add up to one thing, he makes us uncomfortable. He is man of immaculate moral and ethical standards who demands too much of us. He is an irritant. He will not let us forget our failures. He is an abrasive element in the smooth functioning of our machine. These are faults? These are the faults of really great men. Add this to the fact that he is right ninety-nine percent of the time. Leaders of this incandescent quality are rare in any University, and in this one. Reorganizations are required occasionally, and you have every right to administer this University as you wish, but my hopes for the success of your administration compel me to say that it will be to your everlasting advantage if you can find a way to assure that this institution will continue to achieve maximum benefit from the very special character of Henry Clark. Sincerely yours, George M. Norwood, Jr. FW:     Henry, that&#x27;s just an absolutely wonderful letter. I know there were other similar expressions of appreciation and support and I hope you will put that file, which I&#x27;ve had the privilege of seeing, with your papers in the Southern Historical Collection. HC:     I plan to do that, Fran. Following the March conference with Friday and Sharp I took steps to inform the appropriate people of my requested leave and began in a small way to start &quot;banking the fires&quot; in anticipation of vacating my office on July 1. My one year leave of absence was formally approved by the Board of Trustees on May 14. Incidentally, when Paul Sharp later learned of the professional activities I had arranged for my sabbatical he attempted to block the &quot;with full salary&quot; clause. It took a personal appeal to Bill Friday to have the salary reinstated. During June of 1965 I tied up as many loose ends of on-going Health Affairs business as I could and spent several long sessions with Carlyle Sitterson reviewing the unfinished Health Affairs business for which he would become responsible as the new Vice Chancellor on July 1. Then on June 301 supervised the loading of a truck of my personal files from my office and said &quot;Good-bye&quot; to Miss Esther Shelton, my very loyal and competent secretary. Her parting comment was: &#x27;Please go some place where people will appreciate you and don&#x27;t ever come back here.&#x27; My leave taking was put in a much more favorable light the next day when the Chanel Hill Weekly, on the front page of its second section, proclaimed in a banner headline: &quot;Health Center Mushrooming~$30,000,000 in New Construction&quot;. There followed a major story which described eight new Health Affairs buildings which had been authorized by the State General Assembly and for which funds were assured from a combination of state, federal and private sources. There was also a large aerial picture of Health Affairs with the sites of the new buildings identified. The money involved was a huge sum in those days, though it seems small in 1997 because of the CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 194 decreased purchasing power of the dollar. The facilities which would be created would double the overall program of Health Affairs in terms of the students who could be taught, the patients who could be served and the scope of the research programs which could be developed. The planning activities I had launched in June 1957 had their full pay-off in June 1965. This was the main theme of the news story. FW:     That&#x27;s a strange coincidence, Henry. A rave review of the accomplishments of the Health Affairs Division, coupled with what you have told me of the way Chancellor Sharp handled your position as director of that very successful division of the University. HC:     Fran, it seemed very strange indeed, during the early days of July 1965, to wake up each morning at home and not begin to reflect on a laundry list of concerns in my office which needed my immediate attention, and a second list of developmental issues which had to be addressed over a period of time. I could not dally in bed, however, because there were some questions and challenges of quite a different type which demanded my attention. First, there was my future role, if any, at the University of North Carolina. Second, what sort of program could I develop for my sabbatical year which would be fully rewarding from both a personal and professional standpoint? And, third, wouldn&#x27;t it be good to start off with a real vacation? With regard to the first question, while I would be technically on leave of absence from UNC during 1965-66, the change in administrative structure which had eliminated the position I had held and, in my view, the flimsy administrative rationale for this action, indicated to me that I was considered &quot;expendable&quot; by Paul Sharp and Bill Friday. Moreover, I was gradually becoming convinced in my own mind that it would be best for me and my family to move on from UNC. I had poured my heart and soul for fifteen years into the full development of the Division of Health Affairs. The basic programs as originally conceived during 1947-49 were largely in operation by 1956. Then, when the facilities proved totally inadequate, I had conceptualized and overseen a planning process which had left the University poised in 1965 to double those facilities, and in turn, the teaching, research and patient care programs of the whole Division. By traditional standards, we had become one of the premier University Medical Centers in the United States. But my dreams were much larger. The state legislation of 1947 and 1949, reflecting the messages of the Good Health Movement and the Sanger Report, looked to the University to conceptualize and catalyze the development of a statewide medical program which would address the health needs of all North Carolinians. This meant we must also, over time, produce many of the leaders to implement and oversee that program. My attempts to put in motion steps to implement the legislative mandate of the late 1940&#x27;s was opposed by the Dean of the School of Medicine and given little real endorsement by the senior administration of the University. The Sanger dream had gradually faded as new leaders came aboard who either were not aware of or did not agree with the central thrust of the late 1940&#x27;s legislation. And the operating procedures set forth in the Division Code of 1956 were gradually being ignored by both higher ranking and lower ranking administrative officers. While I became more comfortable with the idea of leaving UNC as my sabbatical year 1965-66 unfolded-despite the heart-rending displacement this would mean for Blanche and our children to whom Chapel Hill was &quot;home&quot;-I needed to find a satisfactory job elsewhere. Also, if I departed I wanted to leave with some dignity. I held a &quot;permanent tenure&quot; position at UNC-and there&#x27;s a letter of March 7,1956 in my papers from Chancellor House which validates this point-and I wanted to know what options were available at UNC before making another commitment. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 195 The second question I faced in starting my sabbatical was what I might do which would produce both professional and personal satisfaction. During 1964-65 I had had a number of approaches for new jobs. I had been invited for interviews for the position as Dean of Medicine at four schools-Mississippi, the Medical College of South Carolina, Toledo and the University ofConnecticut-and of these I had paid an extended visit to Connecticut. In addition, I was heavily courted to fill a position as Commissioner of Health and Hospitals for the City of Boston where, among other things, I would oversee the operation of the Boston City Hospital in which several of the medical schools in Boston, including Harvard, had major teaching programs. Perhaps I was just emotionally wrung out, but none of these prospects appeared very attractive at the time, though the latter two and perhaps all five were clearly available tome. FW:     Henry, we&#x27;re going to have to break now while I turn this tape over. Rest your voice. Continue where you were. You had just been talking about some job possibilities that didn&#x27;t, somehow, really appeal to you. HC:     Right. However, Fran, in mid-May 1965 there was a more promising development. I received a letter from Stuart Sessoms, Deputy Director of the National Institutes of Health, indicating that the Regional Medical Programs Legislation was moving through Congress; that its implementation, once passed, had been assigned to the National Institutes of Health and he urged me to consider a two year assignment at the National Institutes of Health to direct that implementation. This led to a series of conferences and the ultimate decision in early July that I would accept a seven month&#x27;s assignment as a personal advisor to Dr. Jim Shannon, the Director of NIH, beginning September 1,1965, to advise on how the legislation, as finally passed, should be implemented. We will talk in some detail about this shortly. This decision made allowance for the two months&#x27; vacation during July and August that I wanted very much, but it left some time toward the end of my sabbatical unscheduled. However, Fran, that time slot was filled in mid-November when Russ Nelson contacted me to say that he had been having some discussions with regard to the planning of a one thousand bed teaching hospital at the University of Leiden in Holland and he wondered if I would be interested in spending several months overseas as a resident advisor for this project. I subsequently met Henk Veeneklaas, the Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Leiden and the newly appointed Chairman of their Hospital Planning Committee, in January 1966 when Veeneklaas was Russ&#x27;s guest at the annual meeting of the Society of Medical Administrators. The three of us flew to Leiden for a three day visit and, as a result, I agreed to serve as Russ&#x27;s agent in Holland for six months, beginning April 1,1966.                                                                                                                B F W:     Well, once you had the vision, Henry, of how you would spend sabbatical productively, how did you decide to spend that long-promised vacation? HC:     Fran, with the prospects of having a whole year to clarify my long term job commitments and with an attractive work program beginning to fall into place for my sabbatical year, I began to focus on a two months&#x27; vacation. The fact is Blanche and I had taken no real vacation since the three week trip to Guatemala fifteen years earlier which we have discussed. We had, of course, had some thrilling adventures along the way, such as the ten week trip to Western Europe sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and about sixteen extended trips to Puerto Rico which we have discussed; and many professional meetings staged at plush resort spots. All of these represented a mixture of professional and personal activities which were rewarding in many ways. But what I needed in July 1965 was a complete change of focus and pace for a period of time. CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 196 How should I spend my first real vacation in fifteen years? The answer was easy, and this simply involved a family summer in Chapel Hill with each member pursuing to the fullest the things he or she was most interested in. Fran, the thought did occur to me, too, that this might be our last family period together in Chapel Hill. At this point Laura was age seventeen and was a rising senior at St. Margaret&#x27;s School in Tappahannock, Virginia; Toolie was sixteen and a rising junior at Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts; and Anne was eleven and an eighth grader in Chapel Hill. All three were members of the Chapel Hill Swim Team which competed almost every summertime week-end against the best of some forty AAU swim teams throughout North and South Carolina. The three Clarks were leading members of our team which was, in turn, among the top three or four AAU teams in the Carolinas. The July-August period was the pay-off time, after a May-June conditioning program, when the big swim meets were held. Blanche&#x27;s role was to help organize and coordinate the two day week-end trips by fifty to sixty team members and parents to attend swim meets in various North Carolina and South Carolina cities. The summer of 1965 proved to be an exciting swim year for the whole family with each of the children performing well. Laura might have earned a swimming scholarship at UNC except for the fact that this was a year or two before the UNC women&#x27;s swim program was activated. Toolie later won ail-American Prep swimming honors at Deerfield Academy and was a member of the swim team at Princeton University. Anne was equally talented but less interested in continuing competitive swimming. In addition to swimming, Toolie was active in Boy Scouts where he had been the Senior Patrol Leader of a large troop for two years and the first of about ten members of his troop to earn the Eagle Scout rank. Apart from assisting Blanche and the children with their swimming, scouting, church and other activities my main focus during that summer was on tennis, which had become and was to continue to develop as a very important part of my life. My commitment to tennis began one day in 1950 when Billy Carmichael telephoned to ask if I could fill in as a fourth player in a game of doubles. I had played a little intramural tennis in college but had focused on golf as a member of the UNC golf team. Billy Carmichael was Acting President of the University at the time of his invitation. He was an avid sports fan and tennis player and we had many good times together for about a year until he suffered a severe nose bleed following a tennis match, was discovered to have hypertension and was advised by his doctor to stop playing. However, by that time I had discovered that tennis was a key entry point to many friendships; that it was a wonderful way to relax from tensions and to promote physical fitness; that it was a marvelously challenging competitive sport; and it was a pure delight to play. I suppose one could say I had become a member of the &quot;Tennis Enchanted&quot;. My interest in the game and my competence in tennis play increased with the passing months. I became aware of an Eastern Carolina Tennis Association (ECTA) through Grady Elmore&#x27;s sports column in the News and Observer and took the initiative to organize a Chapel Hill tennis team about 1953. That team competed with teams from eight to ten other Eastern North Carolina towns on Sundays during the summer for the next twenty years. In 1959,1 served as President of the East Carolina Tennis Association and when the season was over, at the request of its Directors, I served as its agent to convene a state-wide meeting to reactivate the dormant North Carolina Tennis Association in early 1960. I served as the first President of the reactivated North Carolina Tennis Association during 1960, then moved on to CLARK, HENRY TOOLE 197 spearhead the organization of the North Carolina Tennis Foundation in 1961, serving also as its first President. I was followed in this position by J. Spencer Love and then Richardson Preyer. Both of these organizations thrived from this beginning. Today they have permanent headquarters in Greensboro, with a full time staff and many thousands of members. In 1960 there were perhaps 25,000 active tennis players in North Carolina. Today there are almost 25,000 in the Research Triangle area alone. By the summer of 1965 I had become one of the top competitors among the senior-senior meant age forty-five and over at that time-among the senior tennis players in the state. Before that year, I had never had the time to get fully prepared, physically and mentally, for tournament play. My two months&#x27; 1965 vacation gave me a chance to do just that. I entered all of the North Carolina senior tournaments which were staged that summer, had some notable wins over friendly rivals across the state and ended the year ranked Number One in North Carolina senior doubles with partner John Allen Farfour of Goldsboro and Number Two in singles, losing a tough three setter in the finals of the state championships to Fred West of Raleigh, the reigning senior tennis expert of that era. Fran, as you know, I have continued to enjoy and profit from the game of tennis through the years. I have found that the ripple effects of my love for tennis are almost endless. I have taken a tennis racquet and shoes with me on almost every trip I have taken during the last forty years. When these trips involved medical meetings I found that tennis games were excellent substitutes for the afternoon cocktail hours attended by most meeting-goers. Over the years I have played in numerous tournaments in North Carolina, New England, Florida, Bermuda and beyond; have made many wonderful friends in all of those places; and have been privileged to play many of the top ranking senior players in the country. I have frequently enjoyed quite respectable tennis rankings in North Carolina, in New England and in the Southern Division of the USTA. One of my greatest satisfactions was to be inducted into the North Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980. Another was to persuade my wife to take up the game after about thirty years of persuasion. Now Blanche is almost as enthusiastic as I. In January 1997, as a special fiftieth wedding anniversary gift, Blanche presented me several copies of a bound volume of 140 pages entitled, &quot;Tennis, Anyone?&quot;, subtitled, &quot;The Tennis Annals of Henry T. Clark, Jr., M.D., a Charter Member of the Tennis Enchanted&quot;. This contains some fifty feature articles I wrote as a columnist for the Chapel Hill newspaper; a good deal of material about start-up activities of the North Carolina Tennis Association in 1960 and &#x27;61; and additional material, with pictures, relating to my own tennis playing activity. A copy of this should be among my library papers. What lies ahead in tennis? I am anxious to complete this interview series soon and focus again on tennis. I am now eligible to compete in the eighty and over tennis age group and I want to do just that. I was ranked Number One in singles in North Carolina in the seventy and over category ten years ago and I want to be Number One again. FW:     Great thing. HC:     But I need to get in condition, mentally and physically, to compete with those monsters whom I beat earlier and who have been itching for my scalp for ten years. Fran, I think this is enough for today. Next time we should talk about my experiences as advisor to Dr. Jim Shannon with regard to the implementation of the Regional Medical Programs legislation. After that, we should turn to an exciting work assignment I had in Holland. FW:     That will be fine, Henry. I&#x27;ll look forward to it. Thank you for today&#x27;s session.</dc:description>

L st oi y Program University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Iriginal transcript :m dep The utheri ;t or ical Cc 1 I ect i &gt; Louis Round Wi 1 e i brar&quot;: START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A Karl Campell: This is Karl Campbell, and I&#x27;m about to interview Mr. Rufus Edmisten. It is July 15, 1986. The interview is taking place in Mr. Edmisten&#x27;s law office in Ra 1 ei gh, Noi- th Caro 1 ina. KC: I thought we would begin by looking at your family background. When did your family come to North Carolina, do you have any idea? Edmisten; Oh, heavens, we go way back. My family through my father&#x27;s side is really primarily Scotch-Irish. We have a family tree that we traced back quite some time, and we&#x27;re some of the potato famine folks. My mother has a Dutch ancestory. Her maiden name is Hollar. It&#x27;s really ironic that her mother and father were both Hollars&#x27; when they married so there was no change in name. We&#x27;re descended, my immediate brothers and my sister, from just good stout, hard-working Scotch-Irish who came to the mountains many generations ago. Most of them were farmers, timber people, cattle raisers. I grew up on a small farm outside of Boone, a place called Perkinsvilie. 1 have so many fond memor ies of my ch i1dhood. KC:  Did your grandparents live in that same area? Edmisten: Oh, my grandparents were born there. Right in the home that I was born in and grew up in which was an original log cabin. I don&#x27;t want to be like Abe Lincoln but the living room. ... I remember very distinctly when we had our first-indoor bathroom because when I was a young kid we had a johnny house out  behind the  house.    It was a two-seater, and it was a f flagstone path that went to the back porch to the johnny house. I reca 11 very dist i net 1y when we c ut through t he 1i ving ,-oom to put the first bathroom ever in the Edmisten home. It was the heart pine logs that had been the original log cabin in the house. It was quite a day in the Edmisten household when the door-was cut to go through to put the bathroom in. KC:  How old were you then? Edmisten: I must have been about five years old when that occured. I&#x27;m forty-five now so that&#x27;s not too long ago. Up in the mountains when I grew up, I remember that most people did not have indoor p1umbing. Most of them had a johnny house. I even vaguely remember when down below the house which sat on a hill in the? middle  of a cow pasture........you didn&#x27;t have things like a fence around the house so if the cows wanted to come up to the edge of the house, they came to the edge of the housebut there was a spring house down below the house where you had what we call a race. In that race that coo1 mounta in waten ran through, and you stored your milk; you stored your butter. I vaguely remember-that. That&#x27;s before we had running water in the house. We had electricity. I remember that having been there the whole time but we did not have a refrigerator. We did not have an electric stove whatsoever. I think the name of it was Good Hearth because the old cook stove still sits there in the home in Boone, and it&#x27;s mine because I cleaned it up. It has the sheaf of wheat as the decal. KC:  Oh, I&#x27;ve seen those. Edmisten: I remember that Mama did all her canning on it, which she still does a great deal, down in the basement. But that particular spring house, I recall. I car, remember very vaguely going down there and seeing the butter and the milk and the other things sitting in that cool water that came out of the spring just above it. A lot of people had that around. So my memories go back to the Norman Rockwell days when we worked very hard because people had large families then. There were five of us boys and one girl. KC:  You were the second oldest? Edmisten: No, my brother David was the oldest, then Paul, then Joe, then my sister Betty, then me, and then my brother, Baker. I was the second youngest. We all worked on the farm before school. In school months everybody had their specific tasks. We didn&#x27;t know the word &quot;chores&quot; because that implies that you&#x27;ve got some sort of a little hobby. They were not chores.  We all had our assignments. KC:  What were yours?  Do you remember&#x27;:&#x27; Edmisten: Well, mine was milking cows. We sold milk to Coble Dairies for a while. You&#x27;d have to get up about 4:30 in the morning. We milked about four cows then by hand. On cold mountain mornings you wou1d wonder if the mi Ik wouId get from the cow&#x27;s appendage to the bucket without freezing up. But at least you didn&#x27;t have the problem of the cow, as in the summer, immersing her tail in something and flapping it around the side of your head. We also had to feed cattle, and that would be done by getting  up very  ear1y and  throwing hay  off a haystack.  We stacked hay; we didn&#x27;t bale it then. We stacked it, and there was a rail fence around it. In the winter months you would have to come down e\zery morning a.nd throw hay off of the stack out to the cattle to eat. Then you would be ready to go to school. I didn&#x27;t have to walk very far to the bus though. I don&#x27;t have &quot;the walk a mile to catch the bus&quot; because we were very close to the road. In the summertime it was working in cabbage and tobacco and corn. I used to hate hoeing corn, tobacco, and cabbage. Some of those rows would take a half a day to hoe the weeds out. Almost half a day to go from one row to the end of the row because it wound around a mountain side - not too much flat 1 and. Sometimes you&#x27;d get a row hoed during a half a day, and you&#x27;d go back up to dinner. We didn&#x27;t call it lunch; we called it dinner. You had breakfast, dinner, and supper. You walked bad; up from what we ca 1 1 ed the bo11om. The bottom was down where the New River ran through a valley, and the land was very fertile there. That&#x27;s where we grew our crops. We&#x27;d walk back up from there, approximately three-quarters of a mile, and have dinner and then head back to the field. I used to hate it so badly and I&#x27;d say, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait until the day that I can get off the farm.&quot; And now my biggest hobby is gardening. 0ur  life waswell,   it reminds me of a Norman Rockwe11--because we  worked hard  during the  week.    Then  on  Saturdays, occasionally we  would get  to go to the movie, just occasionally if we  did not  have to  hoe.  Generally, if it rained real hard, we&#x27;d get  to go  to the  movie.    It was  called the  Appalachian Theatre in Boone. It was a dime a show. I can remember all the Nopalong Cassidys, and those sorts of things that a person of forty-five years old would remember. There was always the sibling rivalry because we were like stair steps. We fought quite a bit but we were very    loyal to one another. There  were quite a few thrashings.   My father never   would give us  our punishment  in front  of anybody.   We  went to  the woodshed.    Now when  David Stockman  made his  famous  statement about I  was taken  to the  woodshed,  I  don&#x27;t  think  that  most Americans knew  what that  meant.   I know very   much what it meant because when  Walter F.  Edmisten took any of us to the woodshed, then you  got a  sound thrashing  with a  hickory switch  in  the woodshed, out of view and sight of everybody else.   When you left the woodshed,  you hoped  you didn&#x27;t  have to go back for another h a 1f y ear.    There  never was  a ny d i scipline prob1em beoause all our Daddy  had to  do was  snap hiss fingers, and we fell in line. I&#x27;m very  perturbed these  days when  I see children in a grocery store ordering  there parents  around.    Little five and six year olds sassing their mother and father arid   not using table manners. It just astounds me because we never would have drearned of that. KC:    It  was a  pretty traditiona1  househoId as  far  as discipline.  Your father ran the show. Edmisten:   Oh,  absolutely.    My mother  doesn&#x27;t  have  a driver&#x27;s license to this day. KC:  Really?  Your sister does, I bet. Edmisten:   Yes,  my sister does.  Mother is not helpless. It&#x27;s just  that in  that kind  of atmosphere,  Mama didn&#x27;t need a driver&#x27;s license, and she&#x27;s never ohosen to 1earn how to drive. She was a very strong farm woman, who not only worked in the house, she worked in the fields too. Now, it would be light work. It wouldn&#x27;t be stacking the hay. It might be if there was a shortage of help that she&#x27;d ride the rake and be pulled by, in the early days, a horse. The shafts up there, and she would dump the rake. We did the heavier work. Hard work for everybody, and we all felt very put upon at that time as all kids do if they have to work anywhere. KC:   Was your- sister able to get out of the fields before you and your brothers? Edmisten:  Oh yes, she was.  She was sort of pampered.  She would get  to do the things around the house.   She? didn&#x27;t have to do much  in the  field.    For some reason that wasn&#x27;t done?.  See, this is  in the  early fifties  I&#x27;m talking about.   I was born in 1941, and I can re mem be r v e r y d i s t i n c: 11 y the war being o v e r. I can remember the first car we ever had. We always had a pickup before. It was a very traditional mountain family where discipline was administered by Daddy. Nobody even ever looked as though they wanted to be inconsistent with him. But he would do very kind things. He was very strict. He? had to be? with five big boys that were hard to handle. I&#x27;ll never forget the? one time that I had always wanted one of those eight speed bicycles. Frankly, my father didn&#x27;t make much money at all. He was a wild life protector, and the? pay was not good at all. Of course, he? had to farm on the? side to raise six young &#x27; uns. KC:  So he was working out-work, as they say, from as early as you ean   remember. Edmisten: Oh, yes. He was a wild life protector, and that brought a lot of things that we? got to do that other kids would never get to do. I would go with my father, and I would be so thrilled. Here he would go down the road looking for people breaking the law by hunting out of season or fishing too much. Occasionally, he? would let me qo   with him. There were times when he would leave to go somewhere, and he and Mama would be? gone. I would sneak back in his closet and put on a wildlife uniform. I fondly re?member that, and I remember something else I did one time too. They were? gone one time, and I sneaked the keys to the? state car. I had no license. I was about thirteen, and I sneaked the keys out and decided that I was going to take a spin in the state car. It had the siren on it and other things. So I went up the dirt road beside the house, and here comes another- car, and I pulled too far over and got lodged in the ditch. Panic sets in. Here I am, a thirteen year old boy, sitting in a state car, stuck in the ditch with a wildlife uni form on with the pant legs a foot down below my foot. What a predicament to see a thirteen year old kid sitting there in a state car, a wildlife protector&#x27;s car with a wildlife uniform on. I thought, oh my God, what am I going to do. This is it. Daddy will come home?, and I&#x27;ll probably get the thrashing o f my life. L o a n d behol d, P r o viden c e? a p p r o a c h es. Ou r n e i g h b o r up the road, Bill Greig, who was driving a soft drink truck at that time, drove by and saw my predicament and rushed up the road and got  a chain  and came  back and pulled me? out.   I washed the ear   off  very quickly  and put  it back, and he never told on me?. To this day, Bill Greig ranks very high in my life. KC:  Has your father heard this story yet? Edmisten: I final 1y to1d it one time at a meeting during the campaign for governor. That&#x27;s the? first time he had heard that story. KC:   He?  didn&#x27;t try to give you a licking in the woodshed that time. Edm isten : I got no 1 i c?k i ng but I got q u i t e a ch uc k 1 e out of him. For years I carried one of his wildlife badges in my billfold. I didn&#x27;t go around flashing it but I carried it. Just things like that. I had a Norman Rockwell upbringing that most-people today would have? no idea of because it was rural. We would take Sunday afternoon rides. It was a big deal when you would get to go out and get in the ear and just take? a ride. You would normally ride out in the country side to see one of your kin foIks. A1 most all we?re grave 1 roads, and you&#x27;d pull up in their yard which was right in the? middle of the? pasture. Things were much simpler. I don&#x27;t care? what people say now. They were much simpler.  They were a heck of a lot simpler. KC:  Did you have church every   Sunday morning? Edmisten: Oh, absolutely. There was church every Sunday morning. KC:  What church did you go to? Edmisten: Three Forks Baptist Church. Our folks had been in that  churc?h for six generat ionsthe? chiureh I was married in, in 1983. Six generations had been in that church. In fact, it&#x27;s the oldest church. It was formed in 1798, the Three Forks Baptist Church on the way into Boone from Winston Sa 1em on 421. Down below our home? is the old original church homeplace which was also a trail used by Daniel Boone on his westward trek. I remember, when I was a boy, the first church we were in. There has been a subsequent church built since that time. There was no such thing as a basement. The church sat up on rock pillars, and when you had Sunday School, you drew curtains. I remember little green burlap curtains around for the different classes because there was no basement, no lower f 1 oor. The?re were johnny houses for the church. We evolved, I suppose, into a fancy church building. My growing up was one that was hard work. We knew it was hard  work.  We? all dreaded it.  You hated to go out there in the summertime?......day  after day  after day  in the  summer t i me?--to take care  of the  crops.    But you had to.  You knew you had to. Of course,  you  didn&#x27;t  work  on  Sunday  unless  there  was  an emergency. KC:  None at all. Edmisten: None at all. The one? way that you would work, on Sunday, except taking care of the cows and milking, is if you had a crop of hay down in the? field, and you knew that you had to get it up that day, or it was going to rain on it and possibly ruin it.  Y o u c o u 1 d d o t h a t. The trips to town were very simple then because there were no shopping centers. There were a few motels in town because Boone had  always been a tourist town.  A trip to town me?ant that you went to the main street of town, and everything revolved around that. A drive-in reminded me of--my life was like?, what was the movie, oh, he finally got to take Daddy&#x27;s car up to the dr i ve-i n--what was that movie about the fifties? KC:  American Graffiti? Edmisten:   Yeah, American  Graffiti.    That  was  my  time, absolutely.  Pulled some of the same pranks. KC: Well, you must have been kind of relieved to go to school then. It must have been something that you looked forward to because it probably meant you worked less in the fields. Edmisten: Well, in school I always had something everyday that was going on because I was very active in school. I was i nt o f oot ba 1 1. I played basket ba 1 1 until my se?n ior year. I never was good at basketball. I don&#x27;t know why I persisted in it. Although I made the varsity team, I always flunked out because I&#x27;d foul. I just would frail around like a bird beating its wings and would foul out, sometimes in four or five minutes. So my senior year I went out for wrestling and became a state champion and weighed 154 which is a far cry from now. However, you did certain routines that kept you as skinney as a rail. KC:  You must have had a natural affinity for it because you had never   wrestled until your senior year. Edmisten: Yeah. Well, mountain boys are just better at that. We had the state championship team. I was very active politically even in high school. I was the president of my class f or t hree   years and t h e st udent body pres i dent my sen i or ye?ar. 11 KC:    Is  it true?  that there&#x27;s a story about you that you actually had precinct workers in homeroom your senior year? Edmisten:  That&#x27;s correct. KC:  Is it really? Edmisten:  Yes.   I was well organized. KC:  How did you get these people to take it so seriously? Edmisten: Well, I just decided that the only way to win it was to organize. There was one young fellow that was trying to out country boy me. He said, &quot; I&#x27; m thc? country boy candidate? for student body president.&quot; I decided that the only way you could organize a campaign for student body president was not through the classes. You had to do it through homerooms because that was the? place that everybody had to come everyday. Somebody was a s s i g n e? d t o a h o m e r o o m e v e? r y d a y. S o i n m y m i n d I said, o k a y, I&#x27;ve got to organize? all the homerooms so I had me? captains and assistants to captains in all the homerooms who were in charge of my campaign.  And I won it. KC: Well, the question is what did you give back to these people? Edmisten: Well, I must say there was not much political gravy to give back. You didn&#x27;t have? any favors to dispense as if you had become governor of the state. KC: What motivated you from your freshman year of high school to get interested in running for office like that? Edmisten: I have no earthly idea because no one? in my family had ever done it. I did not come from a long line? of public officials.    I  don&#x27;t know of   anybody in my family who had ever been elected to a thing. Except all my brothers and sister, if you go back through the high school annuals, every single one of them had been class president. Yeah, everyone of them. I was astounded one time when I was looking through annuals to find that out. But I just became intrigued politically. At an early age I would go with some folks up to the court house when they had a county convention. I remember when I was twelve years old I gave a little speech at the county Democratic convention. I j u s t r e m e? m ber bei n g i n t rig u e d b y it, a n d it w a s u s e? d q u ite a bi t by a lot of the older political people. I even was hustling votes for candidates before I got my lieense. They wou1d drive me out, and I&#x27;d go up and knock on the? doors and help haul some of them in. KC-3  Thi s was as e?arly as twel ve   or thirte?e?n? Edm 1st e?n :  Th i s was as e?ar ly as f ourt ee?n and f i f t een. KC:   Do you  remember the?  first time  you ever  went to  a polit ical function or conve?ntion? E d m isten:  Ye a h, a b o u t twel v e? y e? a r s o 1 d. KC:  Did you go with your father? Edmisten: Well, he was not allowed to go at that time. Remember, he was working for the state as a wildlife protector. I went with my distant cousin, Jack Edmisten, who lived out the road. He drove me up there. That day it seems like they were just letting about anybody that wanted to, say anything. He said jump up and say something. I got up and told what a great Democrat I was.   I guess that started it. KC:  The roar of the crowd. Edmisten: The roar of the? crowd. Like Jimmy Ruston with whom I attended school at Chapel Hill, Senator James Ruston, he wrote an article on me several years ago that appeared in several papers nationwide, and his take off was that little speech I gave at twelve years old at the? Watauga County Courthouse?. KC: Do you remember your campaign promises your senior-year?  You ran,    you say, on a country boy platform. Edmisten: Well, I just remember this other guy, who bless his soul, is deceased now. He was tragically shot by his- brother some years later. He? was a very prominent person. I remember my campaign was that I would always help you if you need it. I don&#x27;t remember what the platforms were because there&#x27;s not really much you can promise somebody when you&#x27;re running for student body president. You&#x27;re running more of a popularity contest, really. You c?an ta 1 k about a few p 1 at form issues, maybe? 1 onger lunch breaks or something like that. KC: But you took the? country boy line though. Was there a kind of a division of the h i gh sc:hoo 1 ? Edmisten: Oh, a little bit of division. We had one guy who was uptown. I remember that he was running, and we had my main opponent who was a country boy. I decided that since the school was ove?rwhe 1 ming rura 1, a 1though i n Boone?, the population was overwhelmingly rural, that I better be the biggest country boy. So we ran on that, that they should pick the best country boy. KC: Dicj yo u r p a r e? n t s t a Ik. p o 1 i t i c s m u c h a t h o m e ? D o y o u ever recal1? Edmisten:   Not really.   I  would hear  my Daddy talking at times.   He? kept  up on  current events.  He? was very interested, and he  would do  things that  the law  allowed.  Being  a  state employee,   he was  not allowed  to do  certain things  but  they certainly encouraged. . . They really never talked about it much. It&#x27;s just that they would read about it in the? paper. A little paper called the Watauqa Democrat, which is a much larger paper now, but then probably had a circulation of a couple of thousand. They&#x27;d generally read about it. KC: As you left high school then, you went to UNC. But I read somewhere that you were considering being a veterinarian for a wh ile. Edmisten:  That&#x27;s correct. KC:                      What    made     you    change     your    mind? Edmisten: Well, all during high school years, I was extremely much identified with farm life. I took agriculture. I was the president of the Future Farmers of America. The Daniel Boone chapter we called it. I had pretty well planned to go to State College? and major in animal husbandry, and hopefully some time become a veterinarian because 1 loved to work with animals. That&#x27;s all I had knownvery rural, very farm. That seems to mystify people now that my background was so rural. They r&lt;ever would believe me. Then there came along an attempt to apply for the Morehead Scholarship at Chapel Hill. I won the county nomination. Then I won the  district nomination.  That meant that I got to go to the state finals. I went to the state finals. They actually had chosen me? as one of the Morehead Scholars. Then they found out that I was not totally qualified to attend the university because I had not had any foreign languages in high school. I don&#x27;t know why somebody didn&#x27;t tell me that. They should have because kids will get by with as little as they aan when you&#x27;re going to school. So I wasn&#x27;t technically qualified. So I didn&#x27;t get a Morehead. But that summer I went to Carolina. I decided then, having visited the university, and having got that close to a Morehead scholarship. They did award me what they called the? consolation prize. They pay your tuition for one year which was something like two or three hundred dollars back. then. So I went to summer school that first year be?fore?, and took my foreign languages, and got myself totally qualified to get in. I had a 1 ready been accepted at Caro 1 ina, but technica 1 1 y not, because they discovered I hadn&#x27;t had the foreign languages. So that&#x27;s what got me away from going to State College and majoring in animal husbandy and going to school at Carolina. KC:   More though than just tempting you with a scholarship, what was it about Carolina that made you. .  . Edmisten: Well, I don&#x27;t think I would have done very well in technical education because I never took any chemistry and those sorts of technical courses. At Carolina I could tell that there were a lot of free spirits, and that the? political science and the other disciplines similar to that would be more? to my liking. I think that I was pipe dreaming about being a veterinarian.    I had  wanted to  be but  wasn&#x27;t really, I think, prepared to do it. So on my visit to Carolina I decided that that would be it. See when I went down for the Morehead, I was not technically in Carolina. You can try out for one and not go there, quite obviously. No one in my family had ever gone? off for their undergraduate. They&#x27;d all attended Appalachian and lived at home.  So this was a big step for me. KC: Did your parents really support you in doing this, orchid they want you to stay home? Edmisten: No, they didn&#x27;t want me? to stay. There was never-much said but my father had never had the financial burden-of anybody ever going off. So I knew immediately that I would have-to work while at Carolina. So the first job I had was at Lenoir Hall. That used to be? the? mess hall there. I don&#x27;t know what it is now. KC:  The mess hall. Edmisten:   We served  thousands a day, and I cleaned tables over there,  that&#x27;s all,  cleaned tables.  Then you got your meal and a  little something else as I recall.  Then I moved up in the world.    I got  to work  over at  the Carolina  Inn for  a while, busing tables  over the?re?.    I  said  to  myself  at  that  time?, there&#x27;ll be  someday that  I will come back, to this Carolina Inn, and I&#x27;ll be a guest he?re?.   I never   forgot that.  Later on, when I went to  Washington to  work for Senator Erwin, I would come back deliberately many  times to  Chapel Hill and stay at the Carolina Inn because  I rememberecj so much bus i ng t ab 1 es ove?r t here?.  Then I worked  at the library.   I filled in there for a while.   I also delivered the  Daily  Tarheel  as  part  of  my  routine  because students could get up early in the morning and deliver the Daily Tarheel. I worked at the Dairy Bar which is now where Hector&#x27;s, since 1954, is. That was called the Dairy Bar then. For one day there I had my schedule arranged so that I was off from eleven until two. Bo I slung hash and hamburgers and barbeque from 11:00 until 2:00. I remember that I would always be so sleepy at 2:00 when I had to rush from there? because I would have just eaten real quickly, gobbled down a hamburger or a sandwich. I&#x27;d get t o 2 : O0 class, and I c:-ou 1 d bare? 1 y ho 1 d my e?yes open. Then after that for a while I started working yards around Chapel Hill-cleaning up yards, weeding, that sort of thing. My senior-year I m oved o u t i n t o t h e? a o u n t r y i n t o a m obile h o m e? a t B1 a c: k w o o d Junction. END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A 18 START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B KC:  Did you start off majoring in political science? Edmisten: Yeah. I remember I thought that would intrigue me. I didn&#x27;t know what kind of job it would get me but I majored in political science and rninored in Old Testament literature, of all things. K C :  Why di d y o u m i n o r i n 01 d T e s t a m e? n t ? Edmisten: Well, I took what was supposed to be a crip course under Dr. Bernard Boyd, and it turned out to be? one that was difficult  but I loved it so much that I decided to take some 0 t h er religi o us 1 it era t u r e? c? o u r s e s b ecause he w a s a ve r y thrilling man. He had a tremendous impact on his students. He died some years ago but Dr. Boyd was one who has probably influenced more people at Carolina than any other person I know. Another person would be William Greer, another professor who 1  remember who taught Modern Civilization who was so good. I bearly remember Chancellor House. I never had a course under him but I remember him the first year I came because I entered Carolina in 1959. Political science, I enjoyed. I worked hard at my school work. It&#x27;s real funny. I played hard like Carolina boys will do with all the beer parties and the this and the? that. When it came exam time, I worked hard at it, and I made good grades. I never recall making a thing below a B at Carolina and was on the honor roll every time. I was a member of the Order of the? Old Well. A couple of those thingsit was something that you never did in the Edmisten household from elementary school all the  way throughyou  never came  home with  bad grades.   It just wasn&#x27;t tolerated. It would strike the fear of God in your heart. You just didn&#x27;t do it. So I did rather well. I had a good solid B+ average. KC: Do you remember any of the teachers in political science? Edmisten: Oh, J a m e? s P r o t h r o, v e r y w ell, w h o d i e? d just recently. I was so sorry to hear that. Dr. Wallace, I believe he&#x27;s major now, or was. James Wallace, I remember him, very well. Prothro was very good, and he really challenged you. I r e m e? m b e? r havi n g a c o u r s e? i n w h i c h B o b S p e? a r m an, a fell o w a 11 o r n e y here in Raleigh whose father is a very notable North Carolinian, Professor Spea r m a n a t t h e J o u r n alism S c? h o o 1. B ob Spea r m a r,, hi i si son, took a political science course under Dr. Prothro, and he? would always dispel some of these myths that you had about political life. I must say, though, that in my real political life, that there isi no resemblance between what they teach you in college? textbooks and the real life.   None whatsoever. K C :  N o kicld i n g.  W h a t&#x27; s t h e di f f ere nee? Edmist e n : T h e d iffe r e nee i s t h a t the? y h a v e? t h e? t e x t b o o k theories about coalitions, groups, pressure groups, etc. but they make it sound so mechanical. It doesn&#x27;t work that way. In real political life it doesn&#x27;t fit into a neat little package. It&#x27;s all ve r y u n p r e? d icta b 1 e, a n ci s o m u c h o f it deal s with e v en t s beyond your control. They teach you that with certain coalitions and pressure groups and interest groups that you can make certain things happeen. Well, you can&#x27;t do that if the tide of history is not with you. It&#x27;s just like my race for governor. There is nothing in the world that could have changed what has?, going to happen to me. Here I had really worked hard for four or five years to prepare myself to run for governor-. I had done? what I thought were the right things. I had worked hard at being Attorney General. I had gone through a very bloody, bloody primary, defeating ten other peopleheading the first primary, heading the second primary, and having that very close, often times bitter r^ee. Then, for instance, at this time of the year I revn, I was ahead so far in the? polls, it was incredible. I was 28 points ahead. I checked the other day and on my birthday which was July 12, I was 28 points ahead of Governor Mart in at that time. You would think, we all thought, well, it&#x27;s going to tighten up but this is the way it always is. You&#x27;re? going to be governor. Then the tide of history comes through and none of that makes any difference. It doesn&#x27;t make any difference whether they&#x27;ve given kni ghthood status or how many coa1itions you% ve made over all the years. If the tide of history comes through and sweeps you out, that&#x27;s it. My tide of history was that it was? a repeat of 1972 when Skipper Bowles had a very bitter primary, and he never got it put back together. Then there was an incredibly weak national ticket or one very unpopular in the form of Mr. George McGovern. A repeat this time of me having a very bitter primary and even having a rougher, more vitriolic second primary than did Skipper Bowles.   I won&#x27;t- say vitriolic on my part because I never   said an ugly word  about my  opponent, never  did.  But I never   could get Mr. Knox&#x27;s supporters to come over to me. Then the tide of hi story--a very popular, popular president like? Mr. Reagan and a very unpopular democratic candidate like Mr. Mondale who gets up in San Francisco and says I will raise your taxes and who tries to be very brave and nominates Geraldine Ferraro who just is death in the South. Then you add to that that this state, for the first time, had succession on the part of the governor, since the turn of the century. That was:, very unusual for the? state and, in fact, in all southern states where they had thatwhere they&#x27;ve had successionthe first year after succession the opposite party&#x27;s won the? governorship, every time. When you combine all those forces beyond my control, that was the tide of history that swee?p me out. KC: To go against this organizational pattern you had, not only in high school, but back, not to jump back too many years, but back in getting the Attorney General&#x27;s job, you out organized your opponents to get that nomina11on. Thi s t ime I imagine most people would say that you out organized Martin across the state. E d m issten:  I c? e? r t a i n 1 y d i d. KC:  But. . . ,. Edmisten: The &quot;but&quot; was the tide of history. I definitely out organized all my opponents in the democratic primary. I out organized Mr. Knox. I had a far superior organization than Mr. Mart in had. He really had not much of any whatsoever. But the tide of history came along and cast asunder all of my organizational ability.    It  meant nothing.   It meant absolutely nothing.   So that&#x27;s why sometimes the? textbooks just don&#x27;t work. I never  remember anything  that I&#x27;ve  used  that  I  learned  in political science at Carolina although I had good instructors. KC:   What about  political philosophy?  What about theories 0 f g ove rnment ? I know t h at you were cert a i n 1 y i n f 1 ue?nced by Senator Sam Ervin once you got into practice, but do you recall pic:king up any new ideas or new thoughts or new philosophies at Caro1ina that particu1 ar1y hit you? Edmisten: Well, I think that Dr. Bernard Boyd influenced me? more than, say, any of my political science professors because? he? had a real, sincere feeling for the downtrodden. He would say, look, those that have power, and have wealth, and have prestige can always protect themselves. There&#x27;s lots of other people that never   can and that influenced me greatly. I  put that  into play,   I think,  quite often  when I was Attorney  General   and  in   the  days   of  the   84  campaign. That&#x27;s not  very   popular  with the  bourgeoisie.    It&#x27;s not  very popular with  those who  have gone?  beyond the?  Yuppie stage, and they&#x27;ve made  it.    They don&#x27;t want anybody to take it from them. 1  think  that contributed to my tide of history too.  Because the tide of  history had  created this  new class  of people who say, &quot;Look, I  have made mine and damn it, you&#x27;re not going to take it away from  me.&quot;   I&#x27;ve always  had  a  very  soft  spot  for  the downtrodden and those who are? unable to help themselves. At the si a me? time? you have to say that my philosophy of government is one of very limited government. I&#x27;m basically a progressive but I have a huge serving of tradition.   I think that government does far too much. I think we should trim the rules and regulations. If anyone ever went back and art ly zed my years a&lt;~~- Attorney General, they would find that I would score very high on the so called conservative scale because 1 am one who does believe that you take away individua1 freedoms when you have the government meddling in every single thing. It&#x27;s very i roni c to me r i g ht now t h at a 1ot of these peo pie who say they&#x27;re free enterprisers, they&#x27;ll keep the government off your back, yet they want to run the? government in your bedroom. They want to meddle in your private life. They want to determine whether or notwhat a woman can do with her body and those sort of things. That&#x27;s nevc^r   jived with me. How car, they claim that they are? suc?hi fre?e e?nterprisers and \ yc-?t they  ask for  government subsidies  for big  business?   I&#x27;m always one  who just believed, look,  if you really believe in the free enterprise  ss-ystern then don&#x27;t ask the government to help you every time  you get  in trouble.    Over  here in  the? legislature evev^y   year     there are?  literally tons of bills introduced to give some  business   an  advantage   over  another  business  through governmental intervention.   Some  kind of a board is established every   day  or two  to give some established group an advantage by keeping other  people out  of it.    I  waged a  lone battle for a number of  years to try to stop the creation of any more of these occupational licensing  boards because most of their aims were to protect their own membership from outside? competition rather than the health,   safety, and  welfare of the? public.   They always say that we? warnt to have such a\ board to protect the? public.   Well,  I know what the public. meant to most of them  protect ourselves from any more competition. So I&#x27;ve been very consistent about that. I got labeled as anti-business when I ran for governor which is the biggest bum rap in the world. Quite a bum rap because I tried to kee?p the? market place free? from thosie? that use false and deceptive tatics. I think I was very probusiness when I was A11orney General. Sure there we?re t imes when I wacked on the power companies. I wacked on different business entities that didn&#x27;t,  I think, measure up to standards. KC:  J. C. Penney? EdmisH-ten: Sure. I&#x27;ve got cases right now on the? other side where I think I went too far in that. I say that sitting here defending certain people who are? owed money by dead- beats who won&#x27;t pay it back. Under the J. C. Penney case, I established a principle that you can&#x27;t totally harass a man and his family to death over a debt. I think we went a little too far on that. I really do. KC:  You look back, at ten years in that job, do you miss it? Edmisten: Oh, I miss it tremendously. Quite a few people still think I&#x27;m Attorney General. I get calls every day from people saying, &quot; I want Attorney [General Edmisten to give me a call.&quot; The public- is not dumb. It&#x27;s just that some people just don&#x27;t quite catch on for a while. People still think I have magical powers. They think I can get their folks jobs. I can&#x27;t. I was mentioning the other night at a recent fundraiser that fell on my birthday that those? who gave me? money now to erradicate my c ampaig n d ebt  d i d it  o u t o f  respect a n d  f r i e? n d s h i p beca u se  I said, &quot;I can&#x27;t get any of you jobs. I can&#x27;t do you favors. In fact, if I do work, for you, I have to charge you in my legal practice.&quot; I&#x27;ve been very pleased and very heartened that since that election, we have been able to reduce the staggering campaign debt of $270,000 down now to just over $12,000. I don&#x27;t know of anybody that can do that, and I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;ve done it. It&#x27;s been my friends that have done? it because there&#x27;s nothing I can do for people now. The loss of that campaign was the first time I had ever lost any electionever, anywhere, including elementary school. It was quite a shock to me. It hurt. It hurt deeply. It hurt me for weeks every time I walked out of the? building. It hurt me? to get up. It was agony to go to bed knowing that I would wake up and face the fact that I owed $270,000. That my home was mortgaged. That my parents&#x27; farm was mortgaged. That I was going to have to find some way make a living. But everybody has something in them that says you are? either going to wake up each day and face the facts or you&#x27;re going to be absolutely a mole and crawl in a hole. I said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be a mole?. &quot; So I had to force myself many times to walk down the street. I hated walking past the Governor&#x27;s office. I hated going to the General Assembly because if there&#x27;s anything that I despise, it&#x27;s pity. People would tend to give you pity as though there had been a death in the family, and losing ari election like that is a death in the family. Hundreds of people were affected very dramatically, and they always are by elections. I know that there were four or five elderly people who died very soon after the election. It hastened their death. There was no doubt about it in my mind because I&#x27;m the kind of person who does not engender a lackadaisical approach toward me?. People either like me ve\-y much politically, or they dislike me?. The kind of supporters that I&#x27; ve had ove?r all these yc?ars we?re? very voca 1 in their support. They&#x27;re almost fanatical. I find it now at the little gathering I had the other day. There were about four hundred people there. They were charged up, ready to go, and when I lost t h e election, s o m a n y o f thos e t h o u sand s=, o f p eople w e r e? so heart broken that it made? it hard for me? to face them, and they didn&#x27; t know what to say to me. It was a very miserable year, to be honest with you. It was the worst year that I have ever had in my life. I determined that I would survive it and do it with dignity and grace. I&#x27;ve never gone off and pouted. I&#x27;ve never recriminated. You have never heard a public statement out of me that I was done wrong. I wasn&#x27;t done wrong. I didn&#x27;t win. have been the most lucky individual I&#x27;ve ever known in my life. To have been able to survive something like that with all the friends I have intact, and come out with my head up and not owe anybody a thing. I&#x27;ve not had to promise? my soul to anyone, and I&#x27;ve almost gotten my debt over with. I&#x27;ve got a good law practice, and I&#x27;m very thankful that I&#x27;ve got that. I&#x27;m not bitter. KC: You started that campaign, I would think, with a lot of excitement. Every news clipping that I&#x27;ve ever read about you says how much you seem to enjoy campaigning. Clear back. to almost the time when you were Attorney General, they were saying maybe this guy&#x27;s going to run for governor. You chose a year with a lot of excitement, and I imagine? a lot ofas you said earliera lot of expectation that you were going to win it. Edmisten: I really thought I would be governor. I thought if I got through the primaries I&#x27;d be? governor. I never dreamed, really, at that stage when I was thinking about running, that it would be? a repeat of 1972. Then as time went on, even though I was leading tremendously in the polls, I knew that that was a distinct possiblity. KC:  How early?  I mean, car, you recall when you . . . Edmisten: Well, I knew I was going to lose about three weeks out. I felt it. I can&#x27;t tell you how or what because at that stage I was still about 10 points ahead in the polls. But I knew it.   I  felt it.   There  was just certain vibes that I was having that  I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  But yet I-.....the last two weeks I knew that it was a 1osing proposition, and it&#x27;s the most difficult time I ever had in my life except the first month after the election. Something had happened. It was that tide of history sweeping through there. It&#x27;s real ironic: that all those months before the Helms-Hunt race was nip and tuck, and everybody just assumed that I was going to be governor. They didn&#x27;t know whether Jim Hunt was? going to win but they thought I was going to be? governor.  It just goes to show that you&#x27;ve got to be? prepared in life.  Win a few.  Lose a few. KC:   But you  started into  that campaign and were enjoying it.    A lot  of bitter things happened......I think you used the word vitriolic:-.   Did that lessen your enthusiasm for campaigning?  Was this election different for you than the others? E d m iste n : 0 h h e a v ens, y e s. Oh, m u c h. M y A11 o rne y G e? n e r a 1 campaigns, I executed those with precision. I always knew what I was doing. I knew about what would happen. I never had a primary in public in my entire time. It was just general elections. It would have had to be some sort of freakish accident to loss that. I always had a war- chest. I always raised a tremendous amount of money for the council of state race. I had fundraisers, and each year I&#x27;d raise about $100,000 a year.        So it just frightened anybody else from running against me. But when you get into the governor&#x27;s race, it&#x27;s quite different. The? stakes are high because you&#x27;re talking about thousands of jobs. You&#x27;re talking about contracts. You&#x27;re? talking about just immense things over which, you have? control, or you can  inf 1 uence.    The stak.esi  ge?t very  hi gh and peopie start doing-.......they do things that are   unnatural.  They do things that do become very shattering. I would never be able to even recount the kinds of garbage that was put out. It was? just totally, totally falseaccusations about me, about my family., That comes with the territory but I don&#x27;t think it should have to come with the territory.   What  bother s me  is that more and more, I th i nk that a  lot of  good people  shy away from political life because they&#x27;re not  going to  put  up  with  that  stuff.....-the  character assassinations, the attempting to win your race by knocking somebody else down. I will still maintain that if anybody can find, any time in the campaign, either in the primaries or the general grind, where I attacked anyone&#x27;s character that I will hand them a one hundred dollar bill. I did not do it. In fact, in the primaries I never mentioned the other peoples&#x27; names, not whatsoever. I did not think that Mr. Martin was, was mean to me. I don&#x27;t think he was. I have a lot of admiration for Governor Mart in. He&#x27;s lucky. He was at the right place? at the r ight t i m e?. It h i n k y o u c o u 1 d p u t a n ybo d y o n t h e? t i c? k e? t, a n cl they would have won. I think just anybody, because of the tide of history. But the damage that was done to me was done? by my own compatriots in the primaries. The T.V. ads that were run against me and other things: did not embitter me. They hurt me very much. You have to have? tough skin if you&#x27;re in this business but I will never forgive some? people for some of the? things that were done in that campaign during the primaries. KC:  You sieem surprised by it. Edmisten:  I was.   I was shocked.    I didn&#x27;t believe anybody could do that. KC:  Even after what happened. . . . Edmisten:  In the democratic primaries. . . . KC:   Oh, in   the  democratic primary.    But  after you ran against Car-son and   that  whole tax stuff that hap penned earlier, its kind of a foreshadowing in a sense about the kind of politics that can happen. Edmisten: Well, that was all right for Car-son to do it. But in my mind it&#x27;s not all right for one that&#x27;s running against an opponent, in a democratic primary or in a republican primary, to do that to one another. It is just not my kind of upbringing politically. Yeah, I was shocked. I would sit back, and I could never believe it. All my folks? would want to retaliate, and I would never allow it. KC: Did you ever have the chance to talk personally with some of the? other people you ran against, Knox, Fair-cloth? Did you folks ever get a chance to call and talk about these issues at any   time during the campaign? Edmisten: Oh heavens, no. During the campaign I developed a close relationship with Lauch Faircloth. He and I would talk many times. But no, there was never- any opportunity. There was no leadership in this state that would make people sit down and talk about it. I used to always complain that why in the world didn&#x27;t somebody grab all of us together somewhere and say, &quot;Hey look, you&#x27;re? not going to slaughter one another. We will not allow it.&quot; But there was no 1 e?adership anywhere? because everbody at headquarters was so busy helping the Jim Hunt campaign that they let the governor&#x27;s race deteriorate into a bloody pit tenr i e?r f i ght. The? result was that I was the one who was bloodied. Mr. Martin never had to say a word about me. It had already been done by the other boys. When you got Jimmy Green and Eddie  Knox together,   after I had whipped both of them, then it was easy pickings for Mr. Mart in to combine what they had done a1ong with t he tide o f history and do it. KC : The?r e i s a sense of hist or i c i rony a 1 mos:t. A1 most exactly ten years apart. When you were running for the? attorney general job, it appeared that people? with in the government had used their powerright after Watergate, right after all with you and Ervinhad used their power to try to defeat you. Yet ten years later people charged that you or the? SB I or someone was behind trying to ruin Jimmy Green.   Fascinating irony there. Edmisten: I always thought that very was: ironic. I have never quite been able to convince some? people that Mr. Green b r o u ght his o w n p r o b 1 e m ss. o n hi m s el f - -1 h a t i n n o way did I eve r fear him politically. He&#x27;s the? last person I feared politically because I knew that Mr. Green would not get very many votes. I just knew it. The last thing I wanted to do was to do anything that would leave me open to criticism that I had abused my office to hurt Jimmy Green. But there on the? other hand, I couldn&#x27;t have all those allegations sitting there and not do something about them, or I would be? accused of being derilict in my duty. Of course? I turned the? whole matter over- to the? district attorney of Wake County. I cou 1 dn&#x27; t be sitt i ng the?re with a man about to enter the? democratic primary, and me in it too, and be? in charge of the office that was prosecuting him. I never he?Id any animosity against Mr. Gree?n. He and I, in fact, before this incident occurred, had been very close in many ways. I helped him in his first primary for lieutenant governor. I think he? knows that very   well.      When he  ran against  Carl Stewart the? first time,    I  helped Jimmy  Green tremendously.  He was on the phone to me two or three times a day. Of course I wish all of them well and do not blame my defeat on any of t hem. 11 was s i mp 1 y t he? t i de of h i st or y j ust wasn&#x27; t there. If it&#x27;d been any other year with the? lead I had, I would have bc?e?n governor by a landslide. My life has not ended because I didn&#x27;t become governor. I have done? a lot of fulfilling things. I have worked in my gar-den a lot more. I&#x27;ve worked tremendously hard in this 1 aw practice. I&#x27; ve? worked tremendously hard at paying off my campaign debt. I have lived very modestly because I&#x27;m not a man of any wealth. I&#x27;ve never accumulated any wealth and h, a ve pr o ved somet h i ng t o my se 1 f t hou gh. I c:lor,&#x27; t h a ve t o have an army of SBI agents, support personnel, others, to make it. Because when you strike out like? I did, with such a tremendous debt on your back, personal debt, most of it the mortage of my home, it takes, I think, quite a bit of nerve. It would have been the? easiest thing for me to do to go out somewhere? and tell a law firm that, &quot;Look, pay me forty or- fifty thousand a year, and I&#x27;ll bring the? business in. &quot; That&#x27;s not my style whatsoever. But I&#x27;ve proved some? things to myself. It&#x27;s made me a much broader person. I think I&#x27;m better prepared, should I ever go into public life now, to handle it because I sure? know what the? private sector means now. I know what a profit and a loss is now. I know what it is to pay for the monthly expenses and to worry about whether- or- not you are going to make?, meet those expenses or- not.    I have a lot more? humility I think than I had before so I suppose there is something good in everything. I don&#x27;t go back and say that losing the election was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I will not believe that. I&#x27;d sure liked to ha ve tried it. KC: What about you and Sam Ervin? There is no doubt that he has had a big influence or, your life, and in many ways you are very similar. You&#x27;re both country lawyers. You both have great r u r a 1 s u p p o r t i n t he? state. Y o u r- p h i 1 o s o phy o n g o v e r n m e? nt i s v er y similar.    How are   you and Sam Ervin different? Edmisten: First of all, he was a much smarter person than I am.  He&#x27;s much more. . . . KC:  More modest too, ri ght. &#x27;.&quot;&#x27; Edmisten:  More well read and a man who, who was willing to, to not  compromise as  much as I have been willing to compromise. In my  po1itical life  I&#x27;ve compromised  more than he has.   Maybe that was  because he was in the federal area where you don&#x27;t have to ass  much.   But we  were very  close in those years I was with him.   I traveled  with him.   I ate with him.  I slept with him. We never-  had separate motel rooms:; we wanted to save that money. He kept  me awake many nights snoring.  We drank the same bourbon and water except he? liked a little gin&#x27;ale, as he called it, once in a while. His upbringing was, I would say, quite? a bit more genteel and patrician than mine. Senator Ervin was not out there as: a dirt farmer putting cabbage and tobacco and corn in the ground as I did or- helping dehorn cattle or castrate hogs or gather apples for the  cider.  His: was a rural setting, however, it was more of a patrician setting in that his father was an established lawyer, and they always had a help around the house. I&#x27;d say those, those are big differences. I had to work more at my gaining support than he? did because his came about through  just s:ome sort of a sense that people had about him. Well, I was always a very friendly person. I worked on that in high school all the way through. So mine was much more of a traditiona1 getting, traditional way of getting votes than Senator Ervin&#x27;s. Senator Ervin&#x27;s came about just because of a sense that people had about him, and mine was getting votes the? old fashioned wayworking at it. KC: You evolvedalmost fifteen years since you worked with Ervinhas [your] political ph i lossophy evolved also since the days when you were?. . . . Edmisten:   Not much,  not much  because I just see more and more governmental  interference.  Here Mr. Reagan talks about all this n o n-gover n m ental  i n t e r f e r e n c? e, a n d  t h e y&#x27; r e? try i n g  t o  p u t people on the? court that want to run into your bedroom. END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B BEGINNING OF TAPE 2, SIDE A KC: How much was the? typical check that you sent out [after Senator Ervin had money left over after a campaign3? Edmisten: The? typical check would&#x27;ve been about fifteen dollars, and it was: proportional. It was a certain percentage of what everybody  had sent  in.  There were a lot of PACs that sent money in  like $500 or maybe a couple of a the?in, a thousand. They got their- percentage back. KC: Another way that things have changed though, since Sam Ervin&#x27;s senate days, is: the Democratic party and the Republican party in North, Carolina. Sam Ervin, because of lots of historic factors, really never had to campaign. He? might of had to in &#x27;74. Now the Republican party can&#x27;t be taken so lightly in North Carolina, or- am I wrong? I wonder if you can just comment on what you think is happening in state politics. Edmisten: Oh no, the? Republican party cannot be taken lightly. It is not exactly the Republican party because the?re? is: still no big Republican party. It&#x27;s just an attitude that people have. In the? earlier, simpler days: when I was first with Senator Ervin, and I went with him in 1984, we would travel from courthouse? to courthouse. That was generally how you campaigned. If you had the? court house gang, you had it in the Democratic pr imary or even in the? e? 1 ec?t ion. The Democratic party at that time? was still a conservative force in North Carolina. You didn&#x27;t have all these wild things where we&#x27;re out here talking about the? rights of gays. You weren&#x27;t plagued by someone being for ERA and some not being for it, and comparable worth, and all the things that split everybody to pieces right now. The North Carolina Democratic party at that time would&#x27;ve been like the? Republican party in P e n nsylvania i s: t o d a y o r 1 o t s: o f o t h e r p laces. W h a t h as happened is not that people dislike the Democratic party, or- they love the Republican party,   it&#x27;s just simply that the Democratic party got out of  hand.    There was  nothing some  of us could do about it. Because all it ever- seemed to be doing, and most of this: occurred because of  the mass  media......-the mass  media has  done so much to change Ame?r-ican life in various ways be?s:ides politica 11 y. But here you s:ee the seeds being sown up in Chicago in, I think. 1968, with the anti-war demonstrators and others going crazy. Then you evolved on up to this year when the? television viewers see the democratic party in San Fransisco and thousands of homosexuals kissing one another, that sort of business. That&#x27;s not what America wants to see right now with the wave of nostalgia that we have. You know you have people fixing up country kitchens now.  They&#x27;re making their own home cider, their little cheese  making machines......those sort of things.   They don&#x27;t want to see? that. The Democrat ic party has become? the s:ymbo 1 :: f that sort  of thing  over the years.  Those who have evolved from thethey start  out as  &quot;would-be?&#x27; s:&quot;.....-I named  them.  You&#x27;ve got &quot;would-be&#x27;s:, &quot; yuppies, and then the sel f i sheets. Those that have gotten to that stage now that, I&#x27;ve made? mine?, and I don&#x27;t want-anybody else to take it from me. The?y don&#x27;t want to hear about sharing the? goodness of life. They don&#x27;t want to hear things about we want to give quotas to this: particular group or that group. They don&#x27;t want to hear anything about comparable worth. Neither do I, about comparable worth. Its a ridiculous idea. In fact, somebody made me foolishly seem to endorse that one day. But they don&#x27;t want to hear about those things, and that&#x27;s all identified with the Democrat ic party  as being out of step with, what is  happening in  America today where you arc? watching Rambo movies, and you&#x27;re? experiencing a good deal of nostalgia. They just don&#x27;t want t o be id e nti f i e? cl w i t h w h a t t h e? y p e? r c e i v e a s: a bunch of &quot;wh imps:&quot; that stand up for, homosexuals. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened. The Democratic party is in serious trouble today in North Carolina, and people don&#x27;t really like the Republican party. They don&#x27;t  know what  it stands  for.     It&#x27;s just that they, as: much as  we-......the Bible  says there?  shall  always  be  the  poor. They&#x27;re not as many poor as people let on right now. The overwhelming majority of people have a heck of a lot more things than they ever had before in their lives. I realize? the gap is widening. However, they don&#x27;t want to be threatened with that. They don&#x27;t want to hear about any more programs to take a certain advantage from one? group and bestow it on another group. They don&#x27;t want to hear about racial justice where they think that you&#x27;re artificially elevating one? person on an economic or ethical or- legalistic plane? above another person. They&#x27;re tired of it. They&#x27;re mad at it, but it is real. It&#x27;s come back, to haunt everybody in the Democratic party because we are the party that has nat ionally 1 istened to eve?ry interest group i n the country. It seems as: though special interest groups have taken us over. It&#x27;s just that in the? Republican party, the special groups there have been the military industrial complex. Even Eisenhower worried about that. It&#x27;s: ironic that we can cut out funds for everything in the world, yet we&#x27;ve got to give? the? Pentagon a heck of  a lot  more waste.  That  is  that  military  industrial complex that  President Eisenhower mentioned when he left office. He said it was America&#x27;s greatest fear.  Well, it is. But the Democratic party is in sad shape. We are? not attracting different people now. The business community is just deserting the Democrats: by the thousands and thousands in this state. It is: sort of trendy to be Republican or- to be? independent. Very few people give a hoot about which party you are in one way or- another. I&#x27;m convinced that if I had enough money and enough time, I could run as an independent and probaby win a statewide office. The? parties don&#x27;t mean that much any more?. It just happens that the? Republicans have been the b e n i f iciar-i e s o f a s w i n g i n t h e? m o o d n a t i o n ally a n d i n N o r t h C a r o 1 i n a towa r d a m u c h m o r e c? o nse r v a t i v e a ttit u d e a bo u t n o t o n 1 y government but about what people can get by with. That&#x27;s VE?ry dangerous. KC: Something that is difficult for historians to understand is the inner workings of a party, the? inner workings of a government. You&#x27;ve? been in the? middle? of the Democrat i c par-ty here in North Carolina for at least fifteen years. You&#x27;ve seen this growing. You&#x27;ve been involved in elections and in races, and now its here. You said there? wasn&#x27;t a leadership before. At least there wasn&#x27;t a leadership during your campaign for governor. Is there? an emerging leadership in the? Democratic party&quot;&#x27; Edmisten: No, I don&#x27;t think, so. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any emerging leadership. I have great repsect for our Lt. Governor now, Mr.  Jordan, and  there are  others around  but there  is no compel 1 ing 1 eadersh i p. I was: at the state Dt?moc:rat ic:- convent ion just this past Saturday, July 12, 1986. The same old crowd was there that had been there for the past ten years. There was: nothing new there. I noticed that the platform was quite calmed down but that means nothing to the? electorate out here. It means absolutely nothing. They don&#x27;t care? what&#x27;s in a platform. It&#x27;s just that if you put something stupid in there, like? you&#x27;re going to legalize marijuana, or you&#x27;re? going to advocate that gays have certain rights or something like that, then it becomes something that they rally against you, as: a specific, but nobody remembers that it was in a platform. There used to be a leadership in the? sense that we? were orderly about who was going to have the opportunity to be governor. We had an orderly progression. You served four- years. That was it, buddy, leave it alone after that. You worked your way up through certain things. Then succession came along and blew all that. 11 bunched up just oodies of us. For instance, had there? not been succession I wouldn&#x27;t have run for governor in 1980. A number of other people would have though, and I think I would have had a rather- clear shot at 1984. The party leaders used to be able to quiten people down to the extent that they did not let people of the Democratic party savage one? another. All this has gotten totally out of hand because of one? thing in particular, the? mass media, and because of political consultants and hired media guns. I&#x27;ve been one who has seen that. I&#x27;m not going to say  evolve........[rather] devolveinto what it is now. Back in the days when I was with Senator Ervin he never cut a t.v. commercial. There was no such thing. We? rarely spent anywe&#x27;d make up some for-ocures, make? a few radio ads but none of that came around. Now you have hired media gun slingers who ply their trade? by selling methods by which you destroy other-individuals. It&#x27;s: changed the whole face of politics. It has not only destroyed basically the party system. It has: destroyed the ability of a number of good people to get into politics because first of all they can&#x27;t afford it and, secondly, they will not put up with it. That has had more of an affect on the par-1y system and on the change f ror,i Democrat ic party to Republican party than anything I know of. As I say, its not the R epublican party that people have flocked to. The re gistrat ion still has: not changed basically that much. Its just that they feel much more comfortable voting with what the mass media says that the? Republicans: stand for. KC:  What should the Democrats do about it? Edmisten: Well, first of all they better start trying to get some of the good solid business people back into the Democratic party by letting them know that they are not alien. Letting them know that the Democratic party does not believe that there ought to be a rule and regulation for every thing in the w o,- Id. Th a t t h e Demo c r atic pa r t y c a n s t a n d f o r j u stic e? a n d equality, and yet at the same time it will not tax people to death. That it is not going to take rights away from one group and bestow  them on  another group.  Also, we really need to have? some new faces in the? Democratic party. That includes me. I&#x27;m an   old face now.  I wouldn&#x27;t really say that.  I think that. . . KC:  At age forty. . . . Edmisten: Forty-five now. I think. my stock has somewhat gone up because I went up the other day to open up the Horn of the West, where I&#x27;m president of the Southern Appalachian Historical Association, and a couple of little girls asked for my autogr aph.     So I be?lieve? t hat I&#x27; m.......- I t h ink. my st ock is back up. I think you go through a period of about a year when you have fallen out of grace, like they do in the Kremlin, and then they decide you have? been rehabilitated. I find myself in certain quarters now being somewhat of a folk hero. KC: What about the Sanford campaign, is that going to offer an opportunity to reorganize, is: it having that effect? Edmisten: I think it has an opportunity to br ing the Democratic party together. Mr. Sanford is the one person who can do that. I think he? showed that during the primaries: when he won the primary by a little over 60 percent. But that will not do any good unless we get some new people into the? Democratic party who are very active in it. I believe if Mr-. San ford can win the? election this fall that that will start turning the tide. I believe it will be? very difficult for the Democrats to recapture the governorship in 1988 if Mr. San ford does: not win. I think there will be a steady erosion in the general assembly if he does not win. So much of it is tied with these trends that are going around that are propelled by this media. The whole face of America has  changed not  only politically  but every  other way. Our habits are so molded by what comes: on the boob tube. It&#x27;s been the most devastating thing that has ever happened to the world I think, for good or bad. I said devastating, I guess that implies: bad. And I use media. I thought I raised more money than any person that has ever run for governor. Raised five million dollars running for governor.    That&#x27;s a record. KC: You&#x27;ve always been very aware of the media. There&#x27;s that story floating around about the Watergate hearings. You made a deal with the? reporters they could get more pictures if you could be in the pictures.   Is that a true? story by the way? Edmisten: That&#x27;s not a true story. There&#x27;s no way you could be in the room--I was always amused by that-but there&#x27;s no way you could be in the? Watergate hearing room and not have your photograph snapped. At one time I was in charge of the actual hearing about determining the order and who got in and who didn&#x27;t g e t i n, and m ost 11 m e? s the r e w e r e c 1 o s: c? t o t h r - e? e h u n dred p h o t o g raphers i n the r o o m, pi u s m a y b e f o u r h u n dred w r- iting reporters. So there was: no way anybody in there could escape from being in hundreds of pictures everyday. KC:  But you were aware of the? media. Edmisten: Oh certainly. Media, I used the media ver-y effectively, I think, over the years I was Attorney General. Sometimes we? would sit back, and I would say I had too much. &#x27;-Jery effectiveI was very comfortable with the? media. I knew how you-the? T.V. cameras would walk in, and I&#x27;d say do you want fifteen seconds, twenty, thirty, thiry-five, forty. Because see, if you  know how  to use it, you can get your message acros:s, and they won&#x27;t cut it. If you know that night they want fifteen seconds, then tailor your- remarks for the fifteen seconds, and they won&#x27;t cut it. I could do that. I could tell in a minute. Within a second, 1 could do that. KC: Of course?, they also kept painting you as the colorful Attorney General,  the? womanizer,  the? big par-tier, and all that, Edmisten: I always said that my reputation far exceeded my ability and often commented if I had been able to do one? tenth of one? percent of the things that they accused me of doing, I would have been the 60 billion dollar man. Sometimes I&#x27;m very envious that I did not- get to try that. I think that a lot of that stems from the fact that I&#x27;m a very gregarious person. That I generally like people. I&#x27;m a happy, friendly person, and even though I may not be happy, I always have the philosophy that you have no right, if you&#x27;re sad, to go around making other- people sad. That it just compounds the misery. I think, a good deal of that came because of my gregarious nature?, and because I was: always very outs:poken. KC:  Do you sing &quot;Honky Tonk Angel&quot; on occasion? Edmisten: Oh, sure. I did at ray birth&lt;6\dy party the other-night.   It&#x27;s a good song. KC:  You&#x27;re still singing it. Edmisten:  Oh sure, I learned it.   I don&#x27;t forget the words. KC: So my point, in taking us through this, was that you&#x27;ve neen the media grow, and now it is used in a bloody way just the  last two years in that campaign.  Do you think, that the San ford campaign  is going to try to use? the? media in a different w a y t h a n t h e? D e m o c: r a t s: h ave i n t h c? past? Edmisten: Well, the Democrats should have? been more aggressive in the? past yearsnot attacking character but more? agressive. Governor Sanford has determined that he will reverse this business of using the media to destroy people or- to attempt to destroy them. No matter what the other side may do, Governor Sanford is going to keep it positive. That will be a different sort of campaign from what we&#x27;ve seen recently. I think he&#x27;s used the media rather skillfully so far but the biggest problem with the media now is those media advisors &#x27;cause they&#x27;re gun slingers. If my friend Ray Strother were in this room today, I would say the same thing in front of him. He? was my media a d v i s: o r, v e r y g o o d. B u t t h e i r j o b i s t o win. I&#x27; m n o t s a y i n g a t all costs but at almost any   cost, and its your cost. KC: Well, before Mr. Strother you had Charlie Smith. He doesn&#x27;t quite fit that same description or- does he? Edmisten: Well Charlie was my personal confidant, my political advisor, and my point man in the Attorney General&#x27;s office. I depended on him tremendously to keep things in order. He was: from the old school that you punish and reward, and by punish I don&#x27;t mean anything illegal or- personal. Its just that if someone does you a politica1 favo,-, you&#x27;re going return it. When the time comes, you to give out some kinds of little favors. If someone&#x27;s not provided for you, then you don&#x27;t give them any. Charlie was: real good at that. It took it away from me?, and I didn&#x27;t have  to concern  myself with  that sort of thing.  He was extremely politically  astute.   His death  affected mejust,   I can&#x27;t describe  it to  this day..........how  his death  affected me?.   I think that&#x27;s another phenonmenal thing about our campaign. When he died, I thought we were gone. We? would never pick back up because our folks were just shattered out there. &#x27;Cause Charlie was: the one? with whom they had had daily contact. I made the contacts, and then I wou 1 d t urn the cont ac?t s over to h im. 1-1 e would work. them, build them up), and then harvest their results. Even after he died though, we picked back up. We went through those amazing victories in primaries but it never got back to what it could have been. KC: A lot of people said that you took more personal control over the? campaign when.  . . . Edmisten: I did, and it liked to have killed me. Yeah, it-was just too much to do. But the young man that took, over, Dick Car 1 ton, I can never say enough good things about him. Here he? was thrust into that role, and he&#x27;d never really been that deeply involved in politics except through Charlie. He? did a phenomenal, amazing job. All this money was coming in. All these people were going crazy. Around a campaign they just go crazy. As time goes on they get more jittery. They say you&#x27;re not paying enough attention to me. Is somebody else going to root me out of the? job I want. It&#x27;s just internecine war. Is that the word, internecine, war? KC:  It&#x27;s close enough.   I know what you mean. Edmisten: They turn into animals: a lot of times, and what we would  dread more  than than anything else were our very   close supporters. I could really write a book on that sort of thing about what the bowels of a real election arc?, and the inner working, the? petty jea 1 ousies, the? fear that people have that they are being rooted out. Every time you take somebody new onwhich is the essence of politics. You&#x27;ve got to expand your base. It&#x27;s: like an illegal pyramid. That&#x27;s what politics is all about- Wynd Turner&#x27;s Dare To Be Greatillegal pyramid. Every time you take on new players in there, some?body back be?h inc:i who was in rea 1 ear ly, start s t o have severe problems in feeling they are? being rooted out. Here he&#x27;s taken on new friends and new advisors, and he&#x27;s going to forget me when he gets to be governor. I&#x27;ll be totally forgotten. So you have to spend a lot of time soothing them, reassuring them, saying everything is going to be all right. I remember- who my old friends are. I don&#x27;t really take or, new friends until I&#x27;ve been able to visit my old friends. Charlie did so much of that for me that I had to do most of it. Plus keeping twenty hour- days, being in the? air, literally in the air. We averaged about four- hours a day for- a year, on an airplane sometimes seven or eight speeches a day. The tremendous amount of pressure you go through is, is not capable of being put in words or- on paper. KC:  With the media and the? affect you say it is having here on the  state politics  across the country, it really seems to be changing the  way that  you&#x27;ve done  politics........stopping in  every little crossroads  in North  Carolina, shaking every   hand.   The kind of thing you are describing, if you were to run for governor again, would change some of that style? Edmisten: I&#x27;d have to because the population has: been so accustomed now to the media treatment. I beat my brains out going from crossroads to crossroads for years. That&#x27;s how I built my organization. I would never change that. I don&#x27;t care how much exposure you have, how much money you want to spend, if you don&#x27;t have a semblance of some? kind of organization, you&#x27;re not going to win at least in the primary. You&#x27;re just not going to. My organization is: what took. me? through every single election I ever had. I had done that very painfully and skillfully over all those years of going to every little crossroads, appearing at Jaycee banquets, volunteer firemen&#x27;s banquet s:. No pi ace? I haven&#x27; t bee?n i n t h i s: s:t at e? s:e?vera 1 t imes. I can tell you every nook and cranny and byway and highway, and still recall liter-ally hundreds of thousands of names of people and put the right face to it. Campaigningin spite of what they always  wrote?   about  me,    I  always   thought  it   was   very complimentary.......-I viewed it as very   hard work, a job.  Most of the time I hated it. KC:  No kidding. Edmisten: Oh absolutely, the hardest work, that anybody can ever do. I viewed it as a job, that I was: a elected official, and it was my job. There were times when I would come? back, and hide in a restroom, and shed a few tears because I was so tired of people burning my clothes, and jerking on me, and pulling on mejust the  moments that  I would  get to be home with my wife, 1 and it sometimes would be moments. It&#x27;d be sometimes three weeks, and I would see her in another county and say hello to her at a head table, and that&#x27;d be all, that&#x27;d be it. I&#x27;d be off and gone again. I must say I enjoy it far more right now when I go to a pol i t ical g a t h e? r ing, a n d the r e i s n o i m m e n s e? p r e s s u r e? bee a u s e there&#x27;s nothing I can do for- anyone right now except I can certainly help someone politically, I think. I would like to think that I helped my friend Terry Sanford quite a bit in getting his campaign going and organized. But no, I never viewed campaigning as fun. Hard work, I dreaded it. I dreaded going from town to town. I just wanted the solitude of my home?, of my garden. That&#x27;s why now on the weekends I relish so much locking the gate at home, which I hard installed for- security when I was running for governor because of so many threats, of locking the gate and working in my garden. I hadn&#x27;t really been able to do that for years:. There are? c:e?rtai n th i ngs: that I e?njoy now that I neve-,-knew about. I had forgotten about the good life for all those years. KC: Well, you&#x27;ve been in the good life for- two years. I&#x27;m certaintly not going to ask. you to commit yourself to the? future but you&#x27;re only forty five, and you&#x27;ve? certainly been a politician first.  Is that itch returning to you? Edmisten: Well, the itch never left. It&#x27;s just a matter of when. 49 KC: Well, that sounds like a good way to end an interview with the question of when will it be?. So thanks a lot for taking the time.   I appreciate it. END OF INTERVIEW</dc:description>
