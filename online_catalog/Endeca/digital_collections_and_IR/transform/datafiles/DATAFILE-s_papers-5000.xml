          <dc:description>Grant funders are increasingly requiring documented data management plans that stipulate access to and preservation of research data. Few studies have researched the data management behavior of health sciences researchers since these requirements were implemented in the early 2010s. This paper explores data management behavior by researchers in health sciences setting. Through 11 interviews, researchers were asked about the processes and tools they use to share research data with teammates and withexternal researchers. They were also asked about any current practices that facilitate or result in long-term preservation of their data. The outcome of this study is that, while researchers are well versed in short-term management of their data throughout the lifetime of a research project, there is room to improve long-term preservation efforts. These findings may help inform information professionals about their outreach and approaches to facilitate data access and preservation that aligns with the requirements of research sponsors.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This quantitative study investigates the information seeking and giving behaviors of doctors, prostate cancer patients and their family members during consultation visits. The dataset was a transcript of audio-recordings of real-time treatment consultations collected from 171 consultation visits in a clinical trial. For text analysis purposes, a question mark in a transcript sentence was used to signal the information seeking behavior while a period was used to signal information giving behavior. Two counting methods were adopted to investigate the effect of a decision aid intervention that was created to facilitate the prostate cancer patient consultation. Data process, cleaning and analysis were performed by Python, which shows the decision aid intervention promoted the patient&#x2019;s information seeking and giving behavior during the consultations. Topic analysis of specific target population showed different communication styles from Caucasian and African America population. What&#x2019;s more, the results contribute to the decision aid for patients and training on communications in the clinical visits.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Music services provide listeners access to great numbers of available tracks. It is time consuming for listeners to find potential favorite ones. Music listeners increasingly want playlists to be created automatically. This study examines the relationship between background knowledge about music and track co-occurrence frequency in users&#x2019; music listening history and builds a multiple linear regression model to predict the track co-occurrence. So given a seed track, the model can find out which track is most likely to co-occur. A simple objective evaluation compares predicted track with tracks in the users&#x2019; listening history. 13 out of 15 test tracks find the highest rank predicted track in the same listening history.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Impact of Workplace Violence and Workplace Incivility among U.S. Nurses</dc:title>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACTOccupational issues concerning nurses and other health care professionals in health care settings are workplace violence (WPV) and workplace incivility (WPI). The most common form of violence in clinical settings reported against nurses is patient aggression, occurring in nursing homes, inpatient psychiatric settings, and emergency departments. The major forms of workplace violence encountered by nurses are verbal and physical assaults. Current research has identified patient, staff, and environmental risk factors as the major precursors of workplace violence initiated by patients (Martinez, 2016). Negative physical and psychological consequences are often experienced by nurses after an episode of workplace violence (Martinez, 2016).Workplace incivility (WPI) is a growing issue across all public and private sectors and it is gaining attention due to its ability to cause harm to an individual or workgroup without being legally punishable. Researchers have found that acts of incivility can cost companies millions of dollars due to absenteeism, medical costs by treating acute and chronic illnesses, and high turnover rates from loss of skilled professional staff. Further research in this field can provide longitudinal data from a wide range of resources that will assist in creating cost-effective and successful prevention programs. When WPI is left unaddressed, those who behave in disruptive ways on the job will be emboldened to do greater harm or WPV.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper explores the differences between privacy policies on governmental and private enterprise websites. Three industries, healthcare, financial, and political, were selected for comparison. The six policies that were analyzed include regulations.gov, Facebook, healthcare.gov, Blue Cross Blue Shield, The U.S. Office of Personnel Management and Fidelity Investments. These sites were chosen because users may share similar information when interacting with site services. The content analysis was performed to determine if there were significant differences in policy content and coverage. Although there were no obvious differences when policies were examined at a surface level, a close reading revealed that policy coverage and content was not the same. The policies were further analyzed to show how they discuss cookies, the ways in which a user could opt out of data collection, information sharing with third parties, and the often blurred lines between involuntary and voluntary information collection present. The results of the analysis revealed that governmental websites often have policies that provide more detailed and comprehensive information about user choice and policy coverage.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The clinical, logistical, operational, and political problems associated with an outbreak of a highly hazardous communicable disease were highlighted by the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa, which involved over 28,000 cases and saw American healthcare workers repatriated from Africa for medical care after acquiring the disease nosocomially. In the wake of this massive outbreak, and cognizant of the fact that once-exotic foreign diseases are but a plane flight away from American shores, many jurisdictions crafted EVD response plans. Alaska was among these jurisdictions, although the state&#x2019;s culture, demographics, geography, and climate created many challenges, presented some unique opportunities, and necessitated the inclusion of many customized response elements. A problem potentially greater than EVD surrounds the possibility that a future outbreak might be caused by an airborne infectious disease (AID). These diseases, with their propensity for transmission via droplet nuclei, might prove far more contagious than EVD and pose the risk of rapid widespread secondary transmission. In light of this, Alaska now seeks to create an AID concept of operations (ConOps) plan in order to guide the response to these important diseases of high morbidity and mortality. In order to inform the drafting of this ConOps plan, we undertook a broad literature review, conducted survey-based community needs assessments of clinical entities, as well as commercial fisheries, and visited several Alaskan facilities. We report here the results of these studies, discuss certain key policy development considerations, and detail some of the important elements of the ConOps plan.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Quality Improvement in Pediatric Asthma: A Systematic Review</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background and Significance: Asthma remains one of the most prevalent chronic diseases affecting the pediatric population.  The burden of disease asthma poses to children in the United States serves as evidence of its far-reaching life-altering potential: the CDC estimates that, in 2013, 6,109,000, or 8.3% of all US children under age 18, were diagnosed with asthma.  However, it is clear from the data that wide gaps exist in current management practices among pediatricians, despite the fact that best practice guidelines are in place.  Quality improvement processes stand to change the face of this variation, but not before we understand which parts of the QI process are effective, and which are unhelpful.Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review is to conduct a methodological review of the literature to better understand the following questions: What types of quality improvement initiatives are clinicians who provide care for the pediatric asthma population currently undertaking?  What variables determine which quality improvement initiatives are successfully implemented, and what effect does this implementation have on health outcomes?Methods: Data were abstracted and extracted using a critical appraisal table by an individual reviewer.  No meta-analyses were performed.  Summary measures included p-values and odds ratios with confidence intervals. Results: Thirteen articles were retrieved from PubMed.  Three met the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review.  Overall, quality improvement initiatives that aim to address current management practices of pediatric patients with asthma tend to have large, positive influences on outcomes.  The challenges providers face oftentimes are in the form of deciding which variables the initiative should address, in generating buy-in from key stakeholders, and, closely related to generating buy-in, finding ways to incorporate concerns identified by key stakeholders in the developmental stages of the quality improvement process.  A key variable determining the success of implementation is the degree to which leaders of the quality improvement initiative are able to gain key stakeholder interest, and, by the same token, the level to which the initiative is able to address parts of the care process that key stakeholders identify as important.  Discussion: The evidence from this systematic review both highlights that the implementation of quality improvement initiatives can be done successfully, and that, when done successfully, can have a considerably large effect on the health outcomes of members of the pediatric asthmatic population.  What is more, it demonstrates key variables that help define or predict whether the initiative may be a success or failure.  Paying attention to the opinions and perspectives of staff members appears to be an important characteristic of an implementation process that will likely be successful, as is implementing components of the quality improvement initiative in phases.  Of all that the evidence suggests, perhaps the most important is the breadth of effect quality improvement initiatives can have.  We have more work to do, however.Limitations: The main limitation, however, is the fact that only three eligible studies were identified.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The present study seeks to determine how location-aware mobile dating and sex-seeking applications manipulate, complicate, contribute to or develop the landscape of the health information environment for queer men, specifically focusing on information around human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The study used purposive sampling to recruit 8 participants who are male, have sex with men, and use mobile phone applications that are marketed primarily to queer men (e.g. Grindr, Scruff, Jack&#x2019;d). Within the sample of this study, health information sharing related to sexual health information needs, such as HIV status, PrEP usage, and current sexual health, seem to be normalized. Further, this information, which is easily accessible via categorical input fields on dating application profiles, is important for making decisions about interacting with individuals on applications. Finally, negotiating sex with other individuals on dating or sex-seeking applications leads to discussions involving the exchange of health information.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This project examined the gap between physical activity patient-generated health data (PGHD) that are currently collected, versus formats or derivatives of PGHD that healthcare personnel at an internal medicine clinic would find useful (e.g. higher-level summaries or visualizations). Participants from the clinic were observed and surveyed, and a visualization was designed and prototyped based on findings from this research. Afterwards, the visualization was assessed with a utility and usability evaluation. The observation revealed points at which healthcare personnel interact with patient physical activity (PA) information in their current workflow. The survey found that overall, the healthcare personnel were most interested in seeing exercise type, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA, and step count. They expressed interest in using the visualization for determining PA recommendations and baselines, and for overall summarization of PA. The evaluation showed that the visualization performed at a &#x201C;fair&#x201D; level, but some improvements can be made.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Analysis of Immigrant Health Resources in the United States</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Throughout the ever-changing history of immigrants in the US, one thing has been common&#x2014;the lack of health resources and structure to provide access to healthcare for immigrants. Recently, there have been some efforts to provide for immigrants&#x2019; needs, such as interpreter services and clinics for immigrant farmers; however, these programs have several shortfalls and do not resolve the issue. The illusion of services and lack of support can end up harming immigrants even further by eroding trust and diverting public attention away from immigrants&#x2019; health care needs. Despite immigrants having healthier status at the point of entry, their health declines over the time of residing within the United States. Some barriers to health among immigrants include: time and cost, language barrier, discrimination, cultural differences, lack of trust in healthcare providers and local authorities, and location and access. Immigrant health status also varies by age, education, gender, socioeconomic status, acculturation, legal status, and residing community. Immigrant health can impact overall society with high healthcare expenditures due to the need for specialty care. There are potential interventions that can help reduce these barriers like building partnerships, working with religious and cultural associations to build a support system, providing more bilingual staff, and educating immigrant communities on resources available.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Video games are challenging objects to preserve for a variety of reasons, but their value is increasingly becoming apparent to cultural heritage institutions. This study describes interviews conducted with digital preservationists at Carnegie Mellon University, the Computer History Museum, the Library of Congress, Stanford University, and The Strong National Museum of Play to determine how they define meaningful preservation of video games and what they feel are the greatest challenges to achieving this level of preservation.The obstacles the interviewees most frequently identified were laws that make it illegal to perform preservation activities without permission from copyright owners, difficulties obtaining this permission, and insufficient resources to preserve a vast amount of deteriorating media. The study concludes with interviewees&#x2019; ideas for how to overcome these problems and calls for further research on how to make video game preservation successful and scalable.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Visual Query System to Help Users Refine Queries from High-Dimensional Data: A Case Study</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Temporal queries are normally issued for cohort selection from the high-dimensional dataset in many contexts, such as medical related research areas. The idea was inspired by the difficulties when interacting with the i2b2 system, an NIH-funded National Center for Biomedical Computing based at Partners HealthCare System, which seldom provides informative feedbacks and interactive exploration about the clinical events of each query or the expecting follow-up cohort. Considering the complexity and time-consuming nature of complicated temporal queries, it would be frustrating when iterative query refining is needed. The paper presents a newly designed web-based visual query system to facilitate refining the initial temporal query to select a satisfactory cohort for a given research. A detailed interface design associated with the query time frame and the implementation of the visual query algorithm that enables advanced arbitrary temporal query logic is included. In addition, a case study with 3 participants in medical related research areas was conducted that shows the system was overall useful to help the users to gain an idea about their follow-up queries.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The study&#x2019;s aim was to relate task demand, task difficulty with performance during physicians&#x2019; interaction with electronic health records (EHR) system. The results indicated that there was a significant effect of task demands on task difficulty and performance; task difficulty was also related to performance. Practically, the results suggest that EHR designers might be able to positively affect physicians&#x2019; performance by enhancing usability of interfaces aimed at directing physician&#x2019; EHR-related interaction strategies.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study describes a content analysis of materials used to teach library and information literacy skills to undergraduate music students. The analysis was conducted to determine if and how music librarians who design and implement this instruction are informed by the Music Library Association&#x2019;s publication, MLA Information Literacy Instructional Objectives for Undergraduate Music Students. This document is based on the Association of College and Research Libraries&#x2019; Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education.Seven documents from two institutions were included in this study, and their content was compared to the Objectives &#x2013; both the original text of the Standards and the MLA&#x2019;s music-specific additions. The documents varied in format &#x2013; some were intended for use by instructors, others were for students. The amount of clearly displayed influence by the music-specific content in the Objectives varied greatly. This research indicates that there is little standardization or regularity in the Objectives&#x2019; influence.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper describes a series of case studies of public libraries during times of community social crisis. The responses of libraries were compared to historical examples of library responses to times of war and natural disasters, in order to determine how similar these responses were to other types of disaster response.Three cases were examined: the Ferguson Municipal Public Library in 2014, the Baltimore Enoch Pratt Free Library in 2015, and the Charlottesville Jefferson Madison Regional Library in 2017. Reports of the library&#x2019;s actions and of the community&#x2019;s response were collected from contemporaneous and retrospective news reports, interviews, and social media postings. These libraries seemed to exhibit several of the same patterns of behavior exhibited by libraries during times of war or after natural disasters. The closer the library response mimicked that of a library during war or natural disaster, the more positive the community response seemed to be.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The goal of this study has been to analyze the classification of prominent, award winning books on LGBT topics, to see how these topics are being treated in libraries and bookstores today. These materials have, in the past, been placed in a variety of locations throughout the library, sometimes with unsavory connotations. This study, however, does more to show the limited reach of even the most acclaimed fiction and nonfiction LGBT titles in today&#x2019;s libraries and bookstores, with eleven books from the sample appearing in three or fewer institutions. Those books that were frequently held across all institutions visited were frequently organized alphabetically by author or topic, and very few of them were discoverable or browsable based upon their LGBT content.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic commonly and variably used by neonatologists to improve oxygenation and lung compliance in premature infants despite its lack of Food and Drug Administration approval for use in premature infants.  It lacks FDA approval because of safety concerns, specifically the risk of hearing loss and nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis (NC/NL). I conducted a systematic review of all trials and observational studies examining the association of these safety outcomes with exposure to furosemide in premature infants.  Methods: I searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and clinicaltrials.gov.  Included studies reported on the outcomes of sensorineural hearing loss or NC/NL in premature infants (&amp;lt; 37 weeks completed gestational age) who received at least one dose of enteral or intravenous furosemide. I abstracted all selected studies and assessed quality based on the Cochrane Collaboration&#x2019;s tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS-1 tool for observational studies. I assigned a grade for the strength of evidence for each key question using guidelines developed by the Evidence-based Practice Center program of the U.S.  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.Results: I identified 390 titles, 165 of which met criteria for a full-text review. Thirty studies met full inclusion criteria for the review, including 11 studies examining hearing loss and 19 studies examining NC/NL. Only one randomized controlled trial was included in this review. I found mixed results for the association of hearing loss and NC/NL with furosemide exposure, with varying quality of studies. I determined the strength of evidence for both outcomes to be low. The most common limitation in these studies was the lack of control for confounding factors which are independently associated with the outcomes of interest.Conclusions: The evidence for the risk of hearing loss and NC/NL in premature infants exposed to furosemide is low. Further randomized controlled trials of furosemide in premature infants are urgently needed to adequately assess the risk of hearing loss and NC/NL, provide evidence for improved FDA labeling, and promote safer prescription practices.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Following the understanding that perception affects use, this research paper contributes to library assessment literature and investigates patron perceptions of libraries. Since undergraduates make up a majority of the UNC student body, the focus of this paper is on them and their levels of library engagement. A survey of undergraduates was conducted to better understand their perceptions of the UNC libraries and how those perceptions affect library use. The survey found that many students use the library as a place for studying and view it as both a building and as a community. Implications for library practice are examined, and it was found that the libraries could work to improve study areas in the library and improve outreach.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The road area outside 203 Cotter St., a suburban property in south central San Francisco, CA, has experienced frequent flooding in recent years. A preliminary investigation of the site by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), the public utility for the City of San Francisco responsible for mitigation of flooding, attributed the flooding to low elevation and poor grading of the surface. Five technical options were developed: Do Nothing, Green Roofs, Bio-Retention Planter, Easement Pipe, and Detention Tank. Each option was assessed and compared against five criteria: Drainage Performance, Low Financial Cost, Ease of Operation and Maintenance, Minimal Environmental Impact, and Reliability. Each option was represented in an EPA SWMM hydraulic model for assessment of Drainage Performance. One option, an on-site detention tank, was selected as the primary recommended solution to be implemented by SFPUC. An implementation plan was prepared which included considerations toward location, construction, environmental impacts, costing, and scheduling. Two additional options, green roofs and bio-retention planters, were selected as secondary recommended solutions to be optionally implemented by the Golden Bridges School that is currently being built on the property itself.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>UNC Chapel-Hill has great amount of gym facility and fitness group class services which are free to all students. However, students do have trouble in choosing the most suitable fitness group class due to many options and lacking in knowledge. For example, students who are new to fitness aren&#x2019;t very familiar with it. They are lacking in information about what kind of activity the class is doing as well as the best suitable class for them. Some classes are targeted to Intermediate fitness enthusiasts and may not be suitable for beginners, while some classes are entry-level courses for beginners and experienced fitness lovers may find them boring. So it is definitely helpful if the website has detailed description of the class info, including the teacher, targeted people and brief information about the activity. For certain students, they love some teacher who have their unique teaching methods.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In this paper, I analyze the relationship between the number of patients that have been identified with a specific type of disease and the physicians&#x2019; total charge amount. I hold the assumption that the more states within a region that show statistical significance in the relationship, the more serious the disease in that region will be. But after doing a detailed analysis and visualization, I found the assumption to be invalid. However, I found the incidence rate for some of the diseases were related to geographical location. Therefore, I did a comprehensive research to find the reason for this relationship from different perspectives as well as provide some recommendations.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Surveys are widely used for a long time by collecting data from a sample and further making reasonable target population. However, generally, sample cannot fully represent target population. Thus, predictions made from surveys contain biases. To eliminating biases, subgroups inside sample can be re-weighted to match target population. This paper introduces an interactive tool to visualize the re-weighting process in surveys, especially in presidential polls. A detailed description of system&#x2019;s web-based user interface and algorithm are provided. In addition, results of user studies that evaluating the system with twenty users are presented and discussed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>With 659,063 registered refugees, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is one of the top three safe havens for Syrian refugees since the war in Syria escalated and forced a current total of 5.6 million Syrians out of their homes by March 2018 (UNHCR, 2018). In addition to the pre-war prevalence of mental disorders, traumatic stress and stress-related Mental Health (MH) issues pose an increasing challenge on the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) system in Jordan, which is still an underdeveloped sector with limited capacity and many challenges. WHO&#x2019;s Mental Health Gap Action Plan (mhGAP; WHO, 2008) aims to provide governments and organizations with guidelines on how to strengthen the capacity of their Mental Health Services (MHS) Systems. Based on mhGAP, the Jordanian Government developed a comprehensive Mental Health Policy Plan to master the challenge. This policy analysis aims to assess the status quo of the mhGAP capacity in Jordan in order to formulate policy recommendations to support the process of MH Capacity Development in Jordan targeting refugees as particularly vulnerable population segment. Key focus of recommendation lies on the alignment and harmonization of donor and NGO efforts in the Mental Health Sector, the strengthening and decentralization of the national MH workforce increasingly including female health workers, while establishing a centralized monitoring and evaluation system to increase governmental ownership and oversight. Semi-Conditional cash transfers requiring refugee beneficiaries to attend regular meetings with psychosocially versed case managers in order to retrieve unconditional payments would alleviate existential pressures and therefore sources of stress and therefore mental health burden, especially for families with children. Psychoeducation programs to raise awareness among both refugee and local populations in order to reduce stigma is essential to increase health services utilization once capacities are developed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Poor medication management is associated with increased use of acute health services among older adults. Senior PharmAssist is a non-profit community-based program that combines medication therapy management (MTM) with services to address medication access and other basic needs. An outcome evaluation of Senior PharmAssist was conducted to assess the effect of enrollment in the program on acute health services utilization among older adults. The mean number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions declined significantly over time among participants enrolled in the program. These results suggest that enrollment in a community-based program that addresses medication management and access while simultaneously linking older adults with community resources may reduce hospital use.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that impacts millions of people around the world (Bhuia, Nwaru, Weir, &amp; Sheikh, 2017). Evidence has demonstrated that following guideline recommendations lead to well-controlled asthma symptoms (GINA, 2017). Despite the advances in disease management, asthma continues to be associated with poor disease control and high rates of medication non-adherence (Fuhlbrigge et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2003).  A potential solution to this problem is a comprehensive self-management mobile application and program. A literature review was conducted to identify existing mobile health applications that target asthma control and medication adherence in adult patients. Next, the paper proposes an education and management program for adult patients who have uncontrolled asthma through the use of a mobile health application. The paper will discuss the elements of the program, the program&#x2019;s theoretical basis, the goals and objectives, and the implementation plan. Finally, the paper will outline a program evaluation plan, which will be used to ensure the program is meetings its objectives and to determine the impact of the interventions made throughout the program.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Fever is a common reason for presentation to care in rural, low-resource settings. However, not much is known about clinical decision making in such settings.Methods: In this prospective, observational, single-center cohort study of patients presenting with fever to a health center in rural western Uganda, we examined demographic and clinical factors predictive of an initial disposition of inpatient admission after clinical evaluation, but before laboratory testing. We then assessed the effect of laboratory results and system factors associated with a change between initial and final disposition plans.Results: 4,924 patients with suspected febrile illness were included in the primary analysis. The strongest predictors for an initial disposition of admission after clinical examination were impaired consciousness (adjusted risk ratio aRR, 3.18; 95% confidence interval CI, 2.41 to 4.20) and fever on exam (aRR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.81 to 2.88). Providers initially planned to discharge many patients with significant vital sign abnormalities, including tachypnea (8.0%) and hypotension (1.3%). Anemia strongly predicted a final disposition of admission after an initial disposition of discharge (aRR, 35.16; 95% CI, 18.74 to 65.96); however, other laboratory abnormalities including hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hyperlactatemia did not change disposition planning (all P&#x2265;0.20). In those with an initial disposition of admission, living farther than the two neighboring villages was associated with a final disposition of discharge (aRR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.10-4.18).Conclusions: A significant number of patients with abnormal vital signs and laboratory results are not admitted for inpatient care. Geographic factors may influence a patient&#x2019;s final disposition contrary to a provider&#x2019;s initial disposition plan. Future work should assess the longer-term repercussions of discharge with severe illness and a broader study population.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACTBackground: This project addresses the goals of the World Health Organization&#x2019;s (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). One of the major objectives of the Global Action Plan is to strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance. However, AMR surveillance systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain underdeveloped. To overcome the challenge of developing national AMR surveillance systems, it has been suggested that LMICs may benefit from establishing either sentinel- or community-based surveillance systems that build capacity around one site, followed by systematic expansion of AMR surveillance capacity to other sites over time. Herein, we propose to conduct a community-based AMR surveillance project on Shigellosis in Manhi&#xE7;a, Mozambique. Hypothesis:1.The distribution of Shigella ssp. isolates in the community of Manhi&#xE7;a, Mozambique is identical to the distribution of Shigella spp. isolates identified in hospital patient clinical samples from the same population. 2.The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in Shigella ssp. isolates in the community of Manhi&#xE7;a, Mozambique are identical to the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella spp. isolates identified in existing hospital records from the same population. Specific AimsI. Sampling: Households containing children under the age of five in Manhi&#xE7;a, Mozambique will be randomly sampled to acquire a robust sample of 100 Shigella spp. isolates.II. Shigella spp. speciation and susceptibility testing: Standard microbiological techniques will be used to determine Shigella spp. and antibiotic sensitivities. IV. Data analysis: Data will be analyzed descriptively and analytically. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study. To address the two hypotheses, we will assume a 7% prevalence of Shigella infections in children aged 0-59 months. To isolate a robust sample of 100 isolates from the community, we will randomly sample households containing children 0-59 months of age. Within the household, we will take fecal samples from the children and the adult caretakers will answer a questionnaire to capture demographic data and assess AMR knowledge. We will then compare the distribution of Shigella spp. and respective antimicrobial sensitivities of community based-isolates with previous data on clinic-based isolates27,28, to assess whether or not the clinical-isolates are representative of Shigella spp. circulating in the community.  Innovation and Impact: Successful completion of this study will allow characterization of the distribution of Shigella spp. in a well-studied clinical population where community-based estimates for the same population remains to be estimated. The public health importance of this information is that it will allow characterization the preclinical cases of Shigella that are not severe enough warrant a hospital visit. The direct benefit to the community is more evidence-based treatment. The benefit to the scientific community is that this data will allow researchers to characterize clinical and preclinical Shigellosis in this target population. Taken together, this study aims to overcome the limitations with laboratory-based surveillance systems, serve as a template for conducting community-based surveillance in other LMICs, and provide policy makers evidence useful for national, regional, and district level planning of AMR. Finally, the data generated will help stimulate a sense of urgency, help instill a sense of ownership, and raise community awareness of AMR.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Creating an antimicrobial stewardship program to reduce the unnecessary use of nonpreferred antibiotics in a community hospital</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Antibiotic therapy is ubiquitous with over half of patients hospitalized in the United States receiving therapy. Hospitals are required by regulation to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs, however there has been wide variation in what shape these programs take. The literature shows that even small, rural community hospitals can implement meaningful antibiotic stewardship programs. There are multiple areas where stewardship of the penicillin family of antibiotics can improve. Authors discuss how documentation of penicillin allergies is incomplete and discuss how there is room for improvement. Additionally, there is literature about pathways to determine if someone truly has an allergy to a beta lactam, which describes the cephalosporin and penicillin family of antibiotics. These methods include providing test doses to patients with non-severe reactions, seeing if patients previously tolerated beta lactams, and penicillin allergy testing. Penicillin allergy testing has the benefit of conclusively defining whether a patient has an allergy or not. Finally, it has been shown that receiving broader spectrum antibiotic in place of the widely accept beta lactam family has been associated with higher rates of hospital acquired infection, multidrug resistant organisms, and higher healthcare costs.This paper describes an intervention that uses a multidisciplinary approach to reduce the unnecessary use of Aztreonam, an alternative therapy choice to beta lactam allergic patients. The importance of educating healthcare professionals and patients about antibiotics, the expected side effects and the difference between side effects and allergies. An additional focus will be placed on the importance of accurately documenting allergies and adverse reactions in the medical record, and to insure the completeness of these records. Additionally, the creation of a protocolized approach to using Aztreonam in our institution is described. This approach enables pharmacists to help guide ordering providers towards appropriate treatment decisions that are consistent with the literature studied. The outcomes of this intervention are decreased days of therapy and length of therapy for Aztreonam as well as decreased incidence of serious infections. This will hopefully lead to overall decreases in healthcare costs.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Addressing the Public Health Issue of Antimicrobial  Resistance by Re-evaluating Penicillin Allergy with  a Multi-disciplinary Inpatient Team</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background and Objective: A national urgency to prevent further antibiotic resistance has prompted federal funding for antibacterial resistance leadership groups and antimicrobial stewardship programs. Penicillin skin testing (PST) is an important addition to these programs as skin testing can safely identify patients who are no longer allergic and may receive penicillin. Inpatient penicillin allergy evaluations are safe, validated, and will reduce broad spectrum antimicrobial use. Patients who are identified as no longer having penicillin allergy will be able to transition to first line antimicrobial agents, allowing for targeted antibiotic selection. The stewardship allergy assessment team (StAAT) consists of representation from pharmacy, infectious disease, and allergy who offer PST and evaluation for inpatients with penicillin allergy. This team strives to improve patient care by expanding accessibility to this evaluation. Methods: Healthcare providers place consults to the StAAT for inpatients with penicillin allergy. Eligible patients receive PST (prick and intradermal) with Pre-Pen&#xD2; and Penicillin G; those with negative test results receive a supervised oral challenge to amoxicillin. Data related to allergy history, indication for consult, test results, changes in antibiotic selection, length of stay, and cost are recorded.Results: To date, the StAAT has completed 77 penicillin drug allergy evaluations. Indications for testing included the following: pneumonia, fever of unknown origin, neurosyphilis, bacteremia, bone/joint, urinary tract, intraabdominal, and skin/soft tissue infections. Of these, 73 (94.8%) were cleared of previous penicillin allergy after negative skin testing and supervised oral challenge to amoxicillin. Two patients had positive PST and 2 had an equivocal PST. A total of 56 (72.7%) patients were started on a penicillin, penicillin derivative, or cephalosporin after clearance of their allergy. The use of vancomycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and cefepime all decreased after the consult and these findings were significant for vancomycin, aztreonam, and cefepime. Of the 73 patients who were cleared, all (100%) electronic medical records were updated to reflect this updated status. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary approach allows for increased accessibility to penicillin allergy evaluations for inpatients.  Providing penicillin skin testing for inpatients is safe and leads to a reduction in the use of broad spectrum antibiotics.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Injuries frequently occur in contact sports such as football, however injury risk in football is 5 to 7 times greater than other youth contact sports and 14% of all football injuries are serious.  With over 3 million youth football players, there is a critical need to understand rates and common mechanisms of injury at this level.  Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to complete a literature review of existing sports injury surveillance systems and conduct surveillance of injuries occurring in a local Winston Salem, NC youth football organization (ages 9-13) within a single season.  This thesis highlights the role of injury surveillance in sports; need to conduct further surveillance efforts at the youth level; and value of combining surveillance efforts with on-field video collected during sporting events to investigate injury mechanisms in youth football.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The third United Nation&#x2019;s Sustainable Development Goal &#x201C;Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages&#x201D; in subsection seven makes explicit reference to improving family planning and ensuring universal access. Traditional family planning methods have received less attention from researchers than other methods. Traditional methods are common in Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.C.) and are less effective than modern methods (&#x201C;Democratic Republic of Congo Demographic and Health Survey 2013-14,&#x201D; 2013) (WHO, 2015). Recently, the government increased its commitment to support family planning (PMA2020, n.d.). The paper analyzes family planning behaviors and prevalence among women in three outcome categories: non-users, traditional family planning methods users and modern family planning methods users. The paper reports association between the outcome variable and socioeconomic characteristic, exposure to family planning messages and reproductive preference of women living in Kinshasa and Kongo Central, using Performance Monitoring Accountability 2020 data. The paper show traditional family planning prevalence varies across provinces: 22% in Kinshasa and 13% in Kongo Central. Women with more than five children are more likely to select traditional family planning methods in Kinshasa. Non-users are negatively associated with having children and are more likely to be exposed to FP messages through television, which is negatively associated with the probability of non-users. FP programs in the country might select television as method to reach non-users.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The rise in heroin overdose-related deaths among individuals with previous low rates of heroin use is unprecedented to such an extent it incites relatives of victims to petition for new approaches to reduce the death rates. In King County, Washington, officials, inspired by the impact of Insite, a safe injection site (SIS), on heroin crisis, in Vancouver, Canada, are considering implementing similar sites to provide a safe environment for heroin injection in King County. If implemented, these controversial sites will be the first to officially operate in United States. We attempt a better understanding of the proposed initiative by reviewing the scope of the heroin crisis in U.S., the effectiveness and efficiency of safe injection sites in Europe, Australia, and Canada where they are in effect. We also reviewed policies alternatives to SIS that address the heroin crisis in King County. This paper seeks to determine whether safe injection sites will fulfill its purpose, and whether they are better at reducing overdose death rates than other policies already implemented in King County.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Objectives: We sought to examine if there are differences in child weight status, parental feeding behavior, weight perception and attitudes based on a family&#x2019;s food security status in a diverse sample of young children. Methods/Design: Cross-sectional analysis of 24 month old children enrolled in both arms of Greenlight, a cluster randomized trial to prevent childhood obesity at 4 academic pediatric resident clinics.  The exposure was a family&#x2019;s food security status using a validated 2-item screen.  Food insecurity was defined as a positive response to at least one of the screening questions.  Families were dichotomized into food secure (FS) and food insecure (FI) households.  The outcome of interest was parental feeding behaviors, attitudes and weight perception measured using the validated Childhood Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ).  The 7 domains of the CFQ were treated as continuous variables with household food security status as a dichotomous variable.  T-test and linear regression were used to assess associations and we adjusted for education, employment, site, number of children in the home, WIC status and race/ethnicity.Results: Of the 509 Greenlight families assessed at their two year preventive health services visit, 37% were identified as food insecure.  In the adjusted model there was no difference in proportion of overweight/obese patients or caregivers based on food security status. In the adjusted model, FI households were more likely to be worried about their child becoming overweight (p=0.039) and more likely to display pressuring feeding behaviors (p=0.0087) compared to FS households. No difference in restricting and monitoring parental feeding behaviors was observed.  Additionally, there was no difference in perceived parental responsibility for feeding by observed or perceived parental weight.  Conclusions:  Our study found no difference in overweight or obesity based on simultaneous food security status.  However, interestingly, FI households were more concerned about their children becoming overweight/obese and more likely to pressure feed.   Further research is needed to confirm these findings in other settings and provide reasons for these seemingly contradictory simultaneous findings, especially given the high rates of FI in academic clinic settings.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background:  As telephone survey nonresponse rates have grown so has the increased risk of nonresponse bias.  Research has shown that personal characteristics can be associated with telephone interviewer performance.  Identifying which traits are associated with success and using this knowledge to coach poor performers could be a cost-effective way to reduce nonresponse.Methods:  In an attempt to replicate previous findings, I collected data on interviewer characteristics and measured correlations between these traits and two performance measures:  Percent First Refusals (PFR) and Net Contribution to Performance Index (NCPI).Results:  Analyses indicated that perceiving oneself as efficient was associated with a lower (worse) NCPI score (p=.02) and that perceiving telephone interviewing as more difficult was associated with a lower (better) PFR (p=.04).  Conclusions:  Conducting periodic, timely surveys to assess interviewer characteristics and creating tailored training modules based on the results could be a cost-effective method to reduce nonresponse.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>BACKGROUND: Job satisfaction among clinical social workers participating in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) is important for retention, absenteeism, and burnout. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine how the overall work satisfaction of social workers participating in the NHSC LRP differs according to 1. Demographic and practice-level characteristics and 2. Different aspects of work satisfaction. METHODS: Using data routinely collected by the Practice Sights Retention Collaborative from clinical social workers participating in the NHSC LRP, we performed &#x201C;chunk&#x201D; analysis to calculate the odds a social worker would have high overall work satisfaction using: 1. demographic variables; 2. practice-level variables; and 3. both demographic and practice-level variables. In a separate model, we calculated the odds of high overall work satisfaction using six satisfaction constructs as co-variates: 1. Work-life Time Balance; 2. Mission and Values; 3. Community Integration; 4. Staff; 5. Administration &amp; Practice Stability; and 6. CompensationRESULTS: Survey response rate was 75%. Among the 113 clinical social workers in our sample, social workers at integrated care sites had lesser odds of having high overall work satisfaction (adjusted OR: 0.12, p = 0.01) compared to clinical social workers practicing at non-integrated care sites. In the model containing all six satisfaction constructs, each 1-point increase in satisfaction with administration and community integration was associated with 2.96 and 2.48 greater odds, respectively, of having high overall work satisfaction (p&amp;lt;0.05, for both). CONCLUSION: Practicing at an integrated care site was negatively associated with low overall work satisfaction among a sample of clinical social workers participating in the NHSC LRP. Satisfaction with administration and community involvement, on the other hand, were positively associated with high overall work satisfaction.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Aberrant changes in microbiota have been linked to adult obesity, however little is known about the association between obesity and the microbiome in children. In this study we analyzed fecal samples obtained from children in Gal&#xE1;pagos, Ecuador using 16S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing. Children aged 2-11 were classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese by BMI z-score. We compared differences in family taxa abundance and found Porphyromonadaceae, Aerococcaceae, Propionibacteriaceae, and Corynebacteriaceae were overall negatively associated with BMI z-score. Ruminococcaceae was positively associated with BMI z-score. Next, we examined how the association of BMI z-score and family taxa differed by age group and sex. The negative association between BMI z-score and Aerococcaceae and Propionibacteriaceae was significant when making distinctions by sex and the positive association between BMI z-score and Ruminococcaceae by age group. Our results suggest associations between family taxa and BMI z-score in children are sensitive to age group and sex.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to determine if the application process for traffic calming in San Francisco is equitable. Housed under the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), the Residential Traffic Calming Program processes petition applications from neighborhoods on an annual basis. Considering the history of traffic calming along with different interpretations of equity, along with the specific context of the Residential Traffic Calming Program, this study evaluates equity through examining the distribution of traffic calming applications submitted over a period of three fiscal years. Pairing the geography of the petition applications with the demographic data of their respective census tracts, this study concludes that privileged communities are more likely to request traffic calming than disadvantaged communities. This finding carries considerable implications for equity in San Francisco&#x2019;s residential traffic calming process. While the program praises itself for being initiated by residents, disparities in the participation of residents can prevent it from being socially equitable. Coupled with these findings, this paper also suggests further avenues for research.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Despite efforts by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA) to improve maternal and child health outcomes, Nicaragua continues to have high rates of maternal and child mortality (The World Bank, 2016). 1,000 Days of Difference is an integrated, community-based program that aims to improve maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) for high-risk mothers and children aged 0-2 in a resettlement community in Managua, Nicaragua.  Specifically, the program aims to provide high-quality prenatal and postnatal care; increase breastfeeding rates, promote healthy nutrition practices; decrease the prevalence of child malnutrition within the first 2 years of a child&#x2019;s life; ensure access to preventive pediatric care and immunizations; and eliminate unintended repeat pregnancies within a 2-year timeframe. The program is in year one of a three-year pilot phase and will undergo an impact evaluation following the end of the three-year period. The 1,000 Days of Difference program and evaluation plan is presented in this paper. The program and evaluation plan builds upon the foundational work that has already been completed prior to the launch of the program pilot phase. The paper opens with a literature review of similar community-based integrated maternal and child programs in developing countries. The program plan outlines the activities, goals, and implementation plan of the program. The evaluation plan incorporates both process and outcome evaluation objectives, and presents a model for evaluating short and long-term program success.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study presents findings from a content analysis I conducted on the usability of 264 online finding aids from archival institutions. I developed a coding scheme consisting 6 categories and 31 checklist items based on recommendations from previous studies of online finding aid usability along with web usability literature. Despite repeated user feedback from usability studies, this study found that archival terminology still commonly appears in finding aids, but explanations for the terminology are rare. Most institutions implemented standard navigation elements to their finding aids, but the adoption of recommended navigation elements, such as persistent local navigation and you-are-here indicators, was low. A local search box or browser built-in search indication appeared on less than half of finding aids and the adoption of help and Web 2.0 features was low. All institutions formatted finding aid section headings, but stronger formatting could improve finding aid scanability. The study also found that the visual indications for a hierarchical collection structure appear in more than half of the finding aids, but indications for accessing online materials or requesting collection materials were rare.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The importance of this paper is based on the change occurring in industries outside of healthcare based on the emergence of new capabilities and processes. Healthcare and public health are also undergoing changes to their delivery operating models, which results from the increased testing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across underdeveloped and vast African landscapes to transport rapidly, vaccines and other medicines. (HCS, 2017) Public health, healthcare organizations, and rural communities will benefit from a proposal to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) as a rapid delivery platform for vaccines. (USAID, 2017) Specifically, UAVs could be used across Eastern and sub-Saharan Africa to tackle diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and others that are endemic in Africa. (Thomas, 2018) Further, it is postulated that robust and sustainable vaccine delivery programs will result from implementation of programs that will require high capital investment funding through strategic partnerships across different institutions, to include African governments.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper recommends a minimum standard for program and evaluation plans to address HIV prevalence in U.S. state prisons for male inmates that can be adopted nationally or tailored at the state level. HIV in this group is roughly four times that of the general population. This program is based on relevant public health theories, as well as previous interventions that have successfully improved HIV knowledge in prisons. The program is aimed at increasing HIV knowledge and prevention strategies to inmates through use of peer educators and HIV education sessions. Prison staff, including corrections officers, are provided job training to increase HIV knowledge. Stigma about the virus and reduction of risky behaviors are targeted through use of health behavior change theories to guide educational components. Potential impacts include reduction of HIV transmission in prison and improved population health, particularly in communities at highest risk of being incarcerated.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The United States (US) is home to a sizable refugee population. Refugees in the US face a number of health challenges unique to their lived experiences of disenfranchisement and trauma. The factors affecting refugee health interact in complicated ways, leading to the characterization of refugee access to health as a complex problem. Complex problems cannot be solved by traditional, blueprint approaches. Instead, innovative methods must be used. This paper proposes and illustrates the application of design thinking for addressing the issue of access to health for Burmese refugee women living in Chapel Hill/Carrboro, North Carolina. Design thinking is a user-centric process for creating solutions that are viable, feasible, and desirable. Design thinking has shown success in a number of fields for inspiring innovation and empowering communities, yet it remains largely unexploited in the community health setting. Design thinking offers a promising approach for public health practitioners seeking to improve population health while maximizing resources.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ABSTRACT Background The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG-3) through evidence-based health coverage models; aim to mitigate the existing health disparities among populations. The Tanahashi model developed in 1978 and subsequently modified is one model that has been adapted to several countries to identify gaps and barriers in health systems performance. This modified Tanahashi model is referred to as the Bottleneck Analysis instrument for health systems delivery and highlights six determinants of effective coverage. This include Essential Commodities, Human Resources, Geographical Access, Initial Utilization, Continuous Coverage, and Quality. The first three determinants constitute the supply-side determinants and the other three, the demand-side determinants. The modified Tanahashi model was adapted to Nigeria context and is called the Nigeria Bottleneck analysis instrument. This study sort out to assess the nature of the relationships between these determinants that constitute this instrument, premised on the modified Tanahashi model, its ability to perform accurate bottleneck analyses in Nigeria Primary health care system and predict Universal Effective Health Coverage. Methods The study used cross-sectional data from 147 LGAs located in 11 states to examine the relevance of the Bottleneck Analysis instrument in UEHC planning. The measures include Commodity, Human Resources, Geographical Access, Utilization, Continuity and Quality and are continuous variables. Three analytic approaches&#x2014;Pearson&#x2019;s correlation, Frequency count and Ordinary Least Squares regression&#x2014;were used to address the research questions. For select tracer interventions: Routine immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, ii Antenatal care and Skilled Birth Attendance and Newborn Care intervention, were evaluated in this study. Results Data consisted of Ninety-nine (68%) observations from Northern Nigeria and 47 (32%) from Southern Nigeria. Analysis to determine the correlation between the determinants for the select tracer interventions were predominantly not statistically significant on the supply-side. On the Demand side, the results showed linear relationships between Utilization and Continuity (p &amp;lt; .001) as with Continuity and Quality (p &amp;lt; .001). The Nigeria bottleneck analysis instrument collectively explained 26-50% of the total variance in the effectiveness of Routine Immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, Antenatal Care and Skilled Birth Attendance and Newborn Care coverage. Another notable finding in this study was that there is significant decrease in the quality of routine immunization coverage in the northern states in comparison with southern states. Conclusion In this study, the Nigeria bottleneck analysis instrument was not a good predictor of quality coverage for the select tracer interventions. Aside Utilization and Continuity, other determinants that make up the instrument, did not significantly predict effective coverage. Furthermore, the few diminished relationships observed in this study&#x2014; a criteria to perform true bottleneck analyses, impedes proper planning and monitoring of the nation&#x2019;s progress to Universal Effective Health Coverage. To ensure appropriateness of use, improved healthcare information systems for better data quality and well-structured proxy-indicators are required. Likewise, the government should provide the necessary resources to drive competency in data management and collection.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper describes the design and development of a web-based platform to assess, analyze, and manage information resources security in higher education. The paper studies the types of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities that are used and faced by higher education and how-to categorize them into different security levels. The platform manages information resources by creating and operating independent security projects. It takes the user&#x2019;s input of asset, threat, and vulnerability information of each project as attributes and saves the data to a back-end database, then follows risk assessment metrics to calculate and determine risk value and level. Additionally, the visualization module provides the user a cross-view of all existing security projects based on the type and number of the asset, threat, and vulnerability to further assess and analyze them based on visual analytics.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In an effort to gather a list of best practices for user-centered design in virtual reality gaming interfaces, this study combines evidence from industry anecdotal observations, heuristic evaluations, and usability testing with three of the leading virtual reality platforms on the market: HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed Reality. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from a variety of usability scales and questionnaires, think-aloud tasks, observation, and semi-structured interviews. The results of the study suggest that immersion is an effective design feature across all interfaces, however the lack of real-world awareness resulting from immersion can be a major usability concern. Pain-points included controller design and button mapping, physiological comfort, and adapting to new methods of movement and interaction required in 3D virtual environments. The findings emphasize the need to prioritize learnability in the design of VR systems. The paper concludes with fifteen guidelines for designing user-friendly virtual reality interfaces.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper examines the schemas used to describe zines across the collections of five different institutions: the Queer Zine Archive Project (QZAP), Barnard Zine Library, the Bingham Zine Collections, Long Beach Public Library&#x2019;s zine collection, and Salford Zine Library, and compares them to the xZINECOREx metadata schema which was created in order to facilitate a union catalog of zines. Records were selected from each institution, and each schema was mapped to the xZINECOREx metadata schema. The selected records, schemas, and crosswalk were then analyzed. Overall, xZINECOREx has the potential to facilitate the creation of a union catalog and allow institutions to share the work they have already done describing their zine collections. Difficulties in mapping the schemas from each institution to xZINECOREx came primarily from attributes mapping to multiple xZINECOREx attributes, and from xZINECOREx failing to have attributes that described a series of zines under one record.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Understanding and Demonstrating the Need for Inclusion of Military Affiliated Populations in Local Community Health Assessments Conducted in Eastern North Carolina</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background:  Eastern North Carolina is home to large military affiliated populations (MAPs) which not only impact community health but also utilize local health-related resources.  Local health departments (LHDs) maintain awareness of the collective health status of residents largely through the community health assessment (CHA) process.  Due to the importance of the CHA to overall community health, it is also essential to include MAP data, particularly in jurisdictions with large MAPs.  However, little is understood about the current representation of MAP data in local CHAs and the perceived need of including such data.Purpose:  The purpose of this project was to assess the level of MAP inclusion in community health assessments and explore military and civilian health professionals&#x2019; perceptions of current and future representation of MAP data in CHAs.Methods:  Four eastern North Carolina county CHAs were assessed to determine the prevalence of MAP data. MAP-identified data points, defined as information, mentions, analysis of data, or statistics affiliated with the military, were notated and enumerated, and frequency distributions by data point were created. Qualitative analysis was used to examine summaries and subsequent themes from phone interviews conducted among a purposive sample of eight civilian and military health personnel, key informants who were asked questions about current MAP-related CHA data collection practices and future needs of MAP inclusion in CHAs.Results:   MAPs were only minimally represented in the four CHAs reviewed.  Only one CHA did any analysis of a community-identified health issue to determine how it was connected to MAPs.  Many of the MAP-identified data points in the CHAs were not directly related to the health of MAPs and provided only contextual information about the military installations located in the communities.  All key informants interviewed agreed that MAPs should be included in CHAs, even though some barriers to data sharing and participation in the assessment process exist, and that this inclusion benefits the entire community.Conclusions:  Although MAPs were not well represented in the four eastern North Carolina (NC) counties, both the civilian and military health professionals interviewed deemed it important to collect such data in CHAs.  Recommendations offered included nine strategies for maximizing the opportunity for inclusion of MAP data.  This work and the identified recommendations provide the foundation for exploring the opportunity for data inclusion in these and other MAP-represented counties in NC and strategies for developing future interventions to use these data to meet the health needs of MAPs and relevant resources shared by the civilian population.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Social Safety Net as a Budgeting Mechanism?: The Relationship between the Earned Income Tax Credit and Financial Delinquency in Low-Income Households</dc:title>

          <dc:description>As policymakers weigh the costs and benefits of social safety net programs with each round of federal budget negotiations, studying the impacts of these programs on recipients&#x2019; well-being can help make the case for preserving and strengthening the safety net. To that end, this paper examines the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the nation&#x2019;s largest means-tested cash transfer program, and one that research shows is associated with higher educational attainment, increased workforce participation, and better health outcomes for recipients. Through a statistical analysis of approximately 2,600 low- and moderate-income households, this paper explores whether filing for the EITC is also associated with a lower likelihood of financial delinquency. I find that the probability of delaying a rent or mortgage payment is actually higher among households that file for the EITC; other statistically significant predictors of delinquency include the amount of liquid assets, the presence of an outstanding student loan, and marital status. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which the EITC and other safety net programs can assist lower-income households in budgeting for and managing their monthly financial obligations.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In the world of scholarly publishing ideals of open access have developed and thrived in a variety of fields and settings. There has been a wide variety of research published on the benefits and nature of open access, but this research has often overlooked the overlap between scholarly publishing and federal research. Federally authored works are considered works of government and considered in the public domain, but oftentimes the scholarly works of federal authors are copyrighted by private publishers and remain behind paywalls. The number of these works of government that exist behind private paywalls has not been documented and there is little research into the topic. This paper examines this phenomenon through citations gathered across major databases as well as through interviews with copy editors who work with these federally authored papers.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study aims to understand the gaps in the education of future special collections professionals by examining syllabi for rare book and special collections librarianship courses. The history of library education will show that special collections coursework has not historically held an important place in library school curricula. Today, however, courses in rare book and special collections librarianship are an essential means by which future special collections professionals develop the specialized skills needed for success in the profession. Using content analysis, this study compares syllabi for special collections librarianship courses at ALA-accredited library and information science programs with ACRL&#x2019;s Guidelines: Competencies for Special Collections Professionals to identify gaps and overlooked areas in library school curricula.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study explored the workflows used by institutions for processing large film photography collections. I conducted semi-structured interviews with professionals from seven cultural heritage institutions and created workflow maps to visualize the procedures that each institution followed when processing their collections. By creating these workflow maps, I intended to demonstrate the similarities and differences between the institutions&#x2019; arrangement and description practices for processing large film photography collections. I also asked participants questions to investigate whether Greene and Meissner&#x2019;s More Product Less Process recommendations influenced how their institutions processed large film photography collections. Although each of the participating institutions described some or all of their collections at the item level, many used aspects of minimal processing in their workflows.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Since 2010, the Getty Research Institute has developed the CONA project, which strives to be an authoritative resource on art objects and their metadata. ARTstor, a premiere collection of digital visual materials for hundreds of art-related institutions, strives to contribute its massive collection of architectural metadata to CONA. CONA, however, has specific, structured standards for metadata, while ARTstor has only few requirements. This study analyzed 428 architectural works in ARTstor to find the number of objects that had subject headings, and whether they adhered to CONA&#x2019;s standards. While almost all objects had information that could be applied to Subject, less than &#xBC; of the sample had subject headings. Even less were compliant with CONA&#x2019;s requirements. Several of the collections that lacked subject headings, including one of the Getty&#x2019;s, belong to institutions that pioneer metadata standards, which leads to the discussion of the value of subject headings and metadata standards.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper considers how collaborative educational programs for using primary source materials are initiated and sustained between special collections librarians and school groups of young adults in grades 6-12. In particular, this study focused on on-going programs that met more than once where students used primary sources.  Semi-structured interviews with three teachers, a school media specialist, a museum historian, a state librarian, and two public librarians were conducted to identify effective practices of four such collaborations conducted between 2009 and 2017: Brooklyn Connections, the Bangor, Maine Life on a Tidal River online exhibits, a Daily Record transcription project in Wilmington, North Carolina, and the R.O.A.D. Project in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Findings point to common factors for successful programs including accessible and interesting primary sources, providing students time for meaningful research, delivering help from experts, providing customized content, proficiency working with middle or high school students, and nurturing relationships for partnerships.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Social Bot in Social Media: Detections and Impacts of Social Bot on Twitter Users</dc:title>

          <dc:description>A social bot is a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior. Social bots have inhabited social media platforms for the past few years. Although the initial intention of social bot might be benign, existence of social bot can also bring negative implication to society. For example, in the aftermath of Boston marathon bombing, a lot of tweets has been retweeted without people verifying its accuracy. Therefore, social bot might have the tendency to spread fake news and incite chaos in public. For example, after the Parkland, Florida school shooting, Russian propaganda bots are trying to seize on divisive issues online to sow discord in the United States.This study describes a questionnaire survey of Twitter users about their Twitter usage, ways to detect social bots on Twitter, sentiments towards social bots, as well as how the users protect themselves against harmful social bots. The survey also uses an experimental approach where participants upload a screenshot of a social bot. The result of the survey shows that Twitter bots bring more harms than benefits to Twitter users. However, the advancement of social bots has been so great that it has been hard for human to identify real Twitter users from fake Twitter users. That&#x2019;s why it is very important for the computing community to engage in finding advanced methods to automatically detect social bots, or to discriminate between humans and bots. Until that process can be fully automated, we need to continue educating more Twitter users about ways to protect themselves against harmful social bots.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Over the last century, conflicts across the world have resulted in an unprecedented number of cultural heritage sites being purposefully targeted for destruction. While there have been several historical attempts to combat this destruction, the emerging field of digital humanities is now using new digital technologies to also document and preserve cultural heritage demolishment. This article conducts case studies of two such projects: Project Syria, a virtual reality experience documenting the Syrian Civil War, and Manar al-Athar, a digital photo archive that collects pictures of cultural heritage sites in the Middle East. This exploratory study seeks to compare past methods of preservation and documentation of cultural heritage during times of conflict to current methods of preservation and documentation through digital humanities projects, and to determine what digital humanities projects can accomplish that more traditional methods of preservation cannot.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>We are taught that user feedback should be collected and utilized throughout the system&#x2019;s development lifecycle of any application, however, this is not always done in practice. This was the case for UNC&#x2019;s official mobile application CarolinaGo. As project manager of CarolinaGo, I am not aware of any previous such internal attempts to have users evaluate the application. I decided this would be an excellent opportunity to apply my knowledge of usability studies with the goal of producing actionable recommendations for the improvement of the app. I recruited ten students as participants to complete this task-based think-aloud usability study which also included a System&#x2019;s Usability Scale questionnaire and a post-task interview.  After analysis of their likes, dislikes, errors, frustrations, and suggestions I have come up with several recommendations that I think would greatly increase the usability and utility of the application.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study explored how reality genealogy television programming portrayed archival encounters to public viewers during journeys of family discovery. It analyzed content from prime time shows Who Do You Think You Are? and Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr to understand how portrayals of archives, archivists, archival materials and research aligned with traditional archival stereotypes and the professional archival image. The author expanded upon previous research on the archival image and stereotypes in media by analyzing contemporary programs popular among genealogists, one of the largest constituents of archives. The study found some stereotypes were upheld while others were absent, and others were ambiguously portrayed. The findings suggested that reality genealogy television programs failed to deliver a nuanced depiction of the archival profession. The author suggested that increased public outreach and collaboration could help improve the archival image and spread understanding of the role of archives in society.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>With the widespread of online businesses, evaluation of customers' feedback is important for the online recommender systems because online reviews have become one of the most important sources of information for modern consumers before purchasing goods or using services. Many recommender systems use user-generated 'usefulness votes' in order to prioritize reviews for users, but there is much room for improvement. In this work, we attempt to predict the the usefulness vote a user will give to the reviews listed in the restaurant category. Using all features, a binary stacked ensemble model achieved a high level of accuracy (0.83). Several feature groups yielded statistically significant improvements while the features related with content don't have great impact to the usefulness. The authors present the results of the study and discuss their significance for research and practice.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>An Evaluation of a Demand-Responsive Transit Pilot in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park</dc:title>

          <dc:description>GoTriangle, the regional transit agency for the Triangle region of North Carolina, is conducting an innovative, shared ride, demand-responsive transit pilot in Research Triangle Park (RTP). This demand-responsive transit pilot, called Go OnDemand, replaces four fixed-route shuttles. GoTriangle hopes that this pilot program will improve transit service in RTP, provide greater mobility and accessibility, and potentially reduce costs.This pilot is part of a larger, national transportation trend. Transit agencies are shifting operations toward mobility as a service (MaaS) and exploring non-traditional ways of providing mobility to customers, using mobile apps, partnerships with the private sector, and shared models. Go OnDemand fits with this trend, adding a high-tech component to traditional dial-a-ride service by partnering with TransLoc and targeting the service in low-density area of the Triangle where this type of transit model makes sense.Given its innovative and unique operating structure, demand-responsive transit services like Go OnDemand can be difficult to evaluate. This paper attempts to frame Go OnDemand in context by reviewing existing demand-responsive transit performance measures, examining demand-responsive transit typologies, bringing in customer-focused performance indicators, and where possible, comparing Go OnDemand performance to baseline metrics from other comparable services. This paper also looks at Go OnDemand&#x2019;s initial performance over a four-week time period to identify early wins and challenges for the pilot.Initial results from the pilot suggest that the Go OnDemand is providing different but effective transit service in RTP. The expansion of midday service is clearly an added benefit, and so are the additional connections that the point-to-point service provides to apartment complexes and commercial establishments within the service area. At the same time, predictability for regional connections has been reduced, and the service has not yet provided the hoped-for vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions. Many of the performance indicators should be monitored throughout the six months of the pilot to identify areas for adjustment.This paper provides an initial look at how to evaluate the Go OnDemand transit service, baseline performance metrics across various indicators, and an analysis of initial data. Further evaluation activities will be necessary at the end of the pilot to assist in service planning for next year and beyond.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Tracking Seeds and Crawls for Archive-It Web Archives: A Search for Best Practices</dc:title>

          <dc:description>As web archives grow larger, institutions using Archive-It must keep track of a growing number of seeds and crawls. Managing this data often requires outside tools to create records of quality assurance efforts, scoping guidelines, and records for future colleagues and researchers to contextualize the archived websites. In an exploratory study of tracking systems for web archives, over twenty web archivists responded to a Qualtrics survey about their tracking practices as well as the reasons behind those practices. The survey revealed that only half the participants currently track seeds and crawls outside of Archive-It. Those who do track often rely upon spreadsheets, particularly for quality assurance and designing scoping guidelines. After reviewing the affordances of spreadsheets in light of participants&#x2019; stated priorities for tracking, the study suggests alternative practices for tracking seeds and crawls. This study is a crucial first step towards establishing best practices for documentation of web archives.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Cervical Cancer Screening in Latin America: Papanicolaou (Pap) Smear in Combination with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Testing Versus Single Papanicolaou (Pap) Smear</dc:title>

          <dc:description>The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear was introduced in the 1960s as the official cervical cancer screening method in Latin America. However, the reduction of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in this region has not been as successful as that achieved in developed countries, as cervical cancer remains the first or second leading cause of death due to cancer for Latin American women (Yunes-D&#xED;az, Ruiz, &amp; Lazcano-Ponce, 2015). Multiple studies have established that the Pap smear has a low sensitivity (40% to 80%) and a high false negative rate (25% to 50%) (Flores, et al., 2010; Murillo, Almonte, Pereira, Ferrer, Gamboa, Jer&#xF3;nimo &amp; Lazcano-Ponce, 2008; Murillo, Herrero, Sierra &amp; Forman, 2016). New emerging technologies, such as HPV testing, have demonstrated a greater sensitivity, and can identify high-grade cervical cancer earlier than Pap smears.   The purpose of this literature review was to analyze and compare the cost-effectiveness of Pap smear alone versus Pap smear combined with HPV testing as part of a standardized cervical cancer screening program in Latin America. A total of 30 articles and cost-effectiveness analyses were included in this literature review. The cost of Pap smear alone at first sight seems to be lower than that of HPV testing, but when the cost of false negatives is taken into account, the total costs associated with the Pap smear exceed those of other tests with fewer false negatives.  The use of the Pap smear and HPV testing combination ends up being less expensive for its potential to identify 98% of cervical cancer cases, which represents 64% more cases than the Pap test alone (Flores, et al., 2010; Goldie &amp; Gaffikin, 2005; Granados-Garc&#xED;a, Flores, P&#xE9;rez,  Rudolph, Lazcano-Ponce &amp; Salmer&#xF3;n,  2014; Mandelblatt, Lawrence, &amp; Gaffikin, 2002). Most of the reviewed cost-effective analyses indicate that including HPV testing into an already existing cervical cancer screening program could be a highly cost-effective screening alternative for most of the national health delivery institutions. These results may help policy-makers implement HPV testing as part of the cervical cancer screening programs in Latin America (Flores, et al., 2010).</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Exploration of real-time summarization (RTS) methodologies and applications to esports events on Twitter. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time summarization techniques at esports event detection, highlight summarization, and timeline generation.  A two-step system of event-prediction and summarization is proposed. First, using Twitter as the data source, events in an esports game are predicted through machine-learning and classification to determine event occurrences. Four major classification features and five standard classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines) are evaluated to identify an optimal event-detection model. Second, natural-language text processing functions such as term-frequency and TF.IDF are evaluated for effective event summarization and to confirm successful event-detection. The CART (classification and regression tree) model is selected as the most optimal model for event-detection, predicting in-game esports events with 70% accuracy. This study demonstrates the application of Twitter as a data source in detecting real-time esports events.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Health Impact Assessment of the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program in Durham, North Carolina</dc:title>

          <dc:description>There is a growing body of research connecting the built environment, such as housing and transportation, to health outcomes. Although there are obvious connections between some of these topics, such as the way indoor and outdoor air quality may affect respiratory health, there are also less established pathways between policy decisions and the health of a population. A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is one way to determine the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, project, or program before implementation in order to recommend changes that will protect and promote health. HIAs can be an especially useful tool to use when a new policy, project, or program may have substantial impacts on a vulnerable population, such as tenants of public housing. Many housing authorities throughout the United States are beginning to implement the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Program, a federal program aimed at improving America&#x2019;s stock of public housing by converting current public housing units to project-based Section 8 assistance. Through the RAD Program, public housing authorities can position themselves to tap into private sources of funding for real estate, including bank loans, bond proceeds, and tax-credit equity, that can be used to renovate or build new units. The RAD Program removes the current funding restrictions faced by public housing authorities. The RAD Program has been expanding rapidly over the last several years; however, very little research has been done to determine the impacts this program will have on current public housing residents. The Durham Housing Authority is planning to convert its entire portfolio of public housing units to project-based Section 8 assistance under the RAD Program and is interested in identifying ways this conversion may impact tenants, both positively and negatively. Therefore, the purpose of this HIA was to determine how the RAD Program will impact the health of Durham Housing Authority residents and to recommend ways to protect and promote health for this population.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>There is a growing body of research connecting the built environment, such as housing and transportation, to health outcomes. Although there are obvious connections between some of these topics, such as the way indoor and outdoor air quality may affect respiratory health, there are also less established pathways between policy decisions and the health of a population. A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is one way to determine the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, project, or program before implementation in order to recommend changes that will protect and promote health. HIAs can be an especially useful tool to use when a new policy, project, or program may have substantial impacts on a vulnerable population, such as tenants of public housing. Many housing authorities throughout the United States are beginning to implement the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Program, a federal program aimed at improving America&#x2019;s stock of public housing by converting current public housing units to project-based Section 8 assistance. Through the RAD Program, public housing authorities can position themselves to tap into private sources of funding for real estate, including bank loans, bond proceeds, and tax-credit equity, that can be used to renovate or build new units. The RAD Program removes the current funding restrictions faced by public housing authorities. The RAD Program has been expanding rapidly over the last several years; however, very little research has been done to determine the impacts this program will have on current public housing residents. The Durham Housing Authority is planning to convert its entire portfolio of public housing units to project-based Section 8 assistance under the RAD Program and is interested in identifying ways this conversion may impact tenants, both positively and negatively. Therefore, the purpose of this HIA was to determine how the RAD Program will impact the health of Durham Housing Authority residents and to recommend ways to protect and promote health for this population.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Exploring Common Determinants of Caries and Overweight/Obesity in Early Childhood: The 30,000-foot View</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Objectives: Dental caries and overweight/obesity (OWOB) are two of the most common chronic diseases in early childhood. In this study, we sought to determine disease burden and potential common risk factor associations with caries, OWOB, and their comorbidity among preschool-age children. We employed GIS-based methods to examine the geographical differences within the context of social and environmental determinants.Methods: The sample comprised 2,698 preschool-age children enrolled and participating in ZOE 2.0, a community-based study of early childhood oral health in NC Head Start. Self-administered questionnaires were given to caregivers to collect information on parent and child sociodemographic characteristics, and child dietary and health-related behaviors. Anthropometric measurements (i.e., BMI percentiles) and clinical oral health information (i.e., dental caries experience) were collected by calibrated oral health examiners. Analyses included descriptive and bivariate methods, including X2, non-parametric trend tests or ANOVA and spatial hot spot analyses based on Getis-Ord Gi* and Local Moran&#x2019;s I.Results: Two-thirds of children had caries experience, OWOB, or both, and parental education was the strongest predictor of these outcomes (P&amp;lt;0.0005). Parents&#x2019; oral health status (P&amp;lt;0.0005) and individual-level behaviors were also significantly associated with caries and comorbidity. Geocoding revealed significant, non-random geographical spatial clustering of &#x2018;hot spots&#x2019; and &#x2018;cold spots&#x2019; among our analytical sample, that corresponded to census tract-level population estimates of social determinants of health in NC.Conclusions: The identification of &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; outliers in hot spots and &#x201C;dual burden&#x201D; outliers in cold spots can inform next steps in terms of potential programs and further research, including targeted community-based interventions and qualitative investigations. More research is needed on census tract-level to understand smaller-scale community variation.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Effective planning must take a holistic perspective, a wide view of how systems interact. However, this approach can preclude an understanding of individual perspectives and lived experiences. Participatory research methods pioneered outside of the field of planning have been designed to document and address community needs and priorities at a localized level. Among these methods is photo elicitation, a mode of qualitative and visual data collection that involves having participants take photographs that portray a particular concern, and then using the images and a starting point for discussion around how to address those concerns. While photo elicitation and other CBPR methods are becoming increasingly common in fields such as sociology and public health, they are rare in the field of urban planning, despite their applicability and potential value.This paper evaluates the utility and feasibility of using photo elicitation as a tool for community planning, based on a case study of a photo project in Durham, North Carolina. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the method&#x2019;s strengths and limitations in the context of community-based planning and a set of recommendations for how participatory research methods can be incorporated in future planning efforts.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Regional transportation planning organizations known as metropolitan planning organizations are required by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other legislation to address environmental justice burdens and benefits to low income and minority populations. It is important to analyze and address inequities that manifest at the scale of the metropolitan region to fully understand and work toward improving equity outcomes for vulnerable populations. Current Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) plans tend to do a poor job contextualizing equity analysis, clearly identifying equity as a goal for policy and project prioritization, choosing appropriate equity measures to evaluate and monitor over time, and matching revealed disparities to appropriate policies that will counter existing or predicted future inequity. This project first examines common pitfalls that MPOs encounter in their equity analyses and then looks at the most recent research to suggest several strategies to improve these analyses, with a closer look at two case studies. Recent research has shown that appropriate analysis is best done with context sensitive measures, in an indexed form, using population-weighting, rather than threshold, methods for a more granular level of analysis. Finally, the report details how the two MPOs reviewed in the case studies can incorporate these recommendations in future analyses.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>From Gas Station to Gastro Pub: The Potential for Petroleum Brownfield Redevelopment through the North Carolina Brownfields Program</dc:title>

          <dc:description>In this master&#x2019;s project, I provide an overview of brownfields programs in the U.S. and State of North Carolina, analyze existing trends in successful petroleum brownfield (e.g., gas station) redevelopment to date in North Carolina, examine variables that could reasonably predict successful redevelopment, and provide recommendations to build upon these successes through additional policy mechanisms, financial interventions, and engagement strategies. This master&#x2019;s project sheds light on the potential socioeconomic factors that could be positioned and utilized to influence interest in the North Carolina Brownfields Program and to, ideally, reach a mutually-beneficial agreement (with real estate developers, and successfully realize catalytic revitalization of petroleum brownfields (e.g., gas stations) across the state. In this master&#x2019;s project, I attempt to determine the environmental, political, or social factors, if any, that could reliably predict the signing of a Brownfield Agreement (BFA) in North Carolina (e.g., measure of success). My hypothesis was that several social or economic factors (e.g., higher-income, higher-educated populations with higher household value) should predict the probability of having a signed BFA within a certain geography (e.g., denser-populated, urban areas). To achieve this goal, I employed a mixed-method study. I used quantitative and qualitative methods to broadly comprehend key trends, policy framework, funding mechanisms, and market demands for brownfield remediation and petroleum brownfields redevelopment (e.g., gas stations) in the U.S. and, more specifically, North Carolina. I reviewed academic, legal, policy, and periodical literature (e.g., qualitative methods) to develop a broad understanding of the U.S. EPA, its Brownfields Program, petroleum brownfield redevelopment, and its role in both public and private real estate development. After running multiple logistic regressions and other statistical tests, I found the model to be insignificant. Although some individual variables were significant and could be increasing the likelihood of signed BFAs, I found that the model was not wholly predictive of the likelihood of successful brownfield redevelopment in North Carolina. Future research should continue to examine variables which could influence brownfield redevelopment and how these could be leveraged in policy frameworks and funding mechanisms. Relatedly, future research should study these social, political, and environmental variables at the parcel level to observe any trends in land use, development patterns, or industry clusters.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>While search assistance tools can help users with their search in various ways, would they always be effective for every type of search task? This study explored the different performance between two kinds of search assistance tools on exploratory tasks and comparative tasks. A user study was conducted on an experimental web search interface with the search assistance widget displaying on the right-hand side. Each participant was asked to do exploratory and comparative tasks on each search assistance tool. We collected and analyzed data from participants&#x2019; web logs, pre-test and post-task questionnaires, and the semi-structured interviews by the end of the study sessions. The findings suggest the effectiveness of each type of search task is different between the two search assistance tools; the dimension assistance is more helpful in comparative tasks whereas the link-suggesting assistance is more favored by exploratory tasks.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Websleuths are private citizens who spend their spare time using publicly available information usually found online in pursuit of finding the identity of previously unidentified bodies (UIBs). Typically, they seek to find matches between UIB and missing persons profiles found at online databases administered by government agencies and interested groups. However, in many cases the data listed on these databases are missing or incorrect. For this study, I interviewed seven websleuths who have successfully identified UIBs. The purpose of this study is to examine the information seeking behavior of this previously unstudied group as well as to understand how they successfully navigate unreliable information systems for an important purpose. The study results indicate that these cases are solved through dogged persistence and unique heuristics developed as a result of years of experience.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper presents an institutional ethnography analysis of the information worlds of art museum curators and registrars to determine what information sources were used by art museum staff in specific work tasks. This study was conducted in four art museums in North Carolina; the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC, the Ackland Art Museum in Chapel Hill, NC, the Nasher Art Museum in Durham, NC, and the Weatherspoon Art Museum in Greensboro, NC. Six curators and four registrars took part in the study, which consisted of interviews and information horizon maps. The results demonstrate a wide use of both digital and print sources used in work tasks, with an emphasis on utilizing document surrogates in lieu of the physical art object. However, difficulties in accessing information about art objects in other collections was widely reported, making planning exhibitions and conducting research more time-intensive. Further study into museum websites and catalogs is encouraged.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In recent years, there has been growing interest in better understanding human actors in human information seeking behavior studies. Although a number of studies have been conducted to explore users&#x2019; individual differences in search behavior, there have been few studies taking both a theoretical and empirical approach to the relationship between users&#x2019; cognitive ability, task complexity and search interactions. The study presented in this paper evaluated the effect of task complexity and working memory in human information searching behavior. Twenty-four participants from a non-college-bound adolescents sample (ages 18-50+) performed two search tasks of varying levels of complexity and were administered measures of working memory. ANOVA tests revealed three important trends: (1) task complexity had a significant main effect on users&#x2019; perceptions about the task (i.e., temporal demand and level of satisfaction with time spent on the task), (2) working memory capacity had a significant main effect on users&#x2019; search behavior (i.e., queries, clicks, time until 1st click and time between search activities), and (3) a significant interaction effect was found for several search interaction measures (i.e., queries, clicks and time between search activities) and perceived level of temporal demand. Specifically, participants with high working memory capacity carried out more search activities at a faster pace and experienced less temporal workload. Taken together, these results suggest that task complexity and working memory capacity can have effects on users&#x2019; search behavior as well as their perceptions about the search experience.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper serves as an accompanying report to a mapping dataset created in ArcGIS online. This dataset builds on the existing Smart Location Database provided by the EPA. The Smart Location Database lists over 80 attributes for every census block group in the United States. Replicating the methods used by the EPA to measure automobile accessibility, this project calculates bicycle accessibility to jobs and workers in the city of Atlanta, GA. In the case of Atlanta, accessibility is driven by infrastructure more strongly than by the number of jobs or workers in a given region. As planning and policy decisions have far reaching impacts, the incorporation of bicycle accessibility into the existing Smart Location Database bolsters informed decision-making.The dataset is publicly available at:   https://arcg.is/1WeGOm</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was created to reverse the effects of redlining in African-American and low income communities. During the open comment period of a bank merger process, there is a stipulation in the law that allows for communities to negotiate with banks. This paper is an assessment of the involvement of reinvestment coalitions in the creation of community benefits agreements with banks and how they partner with community organizations to navigate this process.  This paper contains two case studies of recent CBAs. The paper begins with a historical background of financial institutions and the housing policies that led to the creation of the Community Reinvestment Act. Following this background, the two case studies presented are of CBAs with Cathay Bank and Huntington Bank. From these case studies, the following lessons emerged:&#x2022;Importance of Reinvestment Coalitions&#x2022;Collective Visioning Process&#x2022;Relationship Building for the Future&#x2022;Accountability &amp; Ongoing ParticipationFollowing these lessons is a discussion of how other tools are needed to further community development. The paper concludes with recommendations for other tools that include the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program and Equity with a Twist social capital product, and the ways that reinvestment coalitions can be involved in assisting community organizations to take advantage of these opportunities.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>After a recovery from the 2008 crisis, residential real estate prices in Prague started to rise significantly in 2015--more than 10% in both 2016 and 2017. The Prague Institute of Planning and Development would like to better understand the mechanisms responsible for these price increases. The hypothesis is there is a more important fundamental problem on the supply side causing this property price hike rather than on the demand side. Among experts, it is widely accepted that the building-permitting processes are complicated and byzantine in the Czech Republic that create high uncertainty via long waiting periods. Based on literature it is expected that this complicated regulation might negatively affect price levels of new residential. These assumptions will be tested on currently accessible data and also explore whether the length of building permitting process varies across locations or time.The results of this paper will be used also as one of the inputs for Prague&#x2019;s brownfield redevelopment strategy that was initiated in January 2018 and is being coordinated by the Strategy and Development Office at the Prague Institute of Planning and Development.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>DKT Nigeria is a nonprofit organization working to accelerate the uptake of a new injectable contraceptive, Sayana Press. DKT Nigeria integrates five innovative business activities (Social Marketing, Revenue Generation, Cross-Subsidization, Product Reengineering, and Optimized HR) across its marketing, finance, and operating strategies to disseminate Sayana Press.  This case study uses causal loop diagramming to synthesize data around the five innovative business activities in order to 1) Describe DKT Nigeria&#x2019;s experience in executing its strategies for Sayana Press, and 2) Recommend additional data collection to further extend understanding of how to support the capacity of disruptive innovation for modern contraception uptake in Nigeria. The organization&#x2019;s experience with Optimized HR emerged as a key finding because of its relevance to the ability target non-consumption of modern contraception and capacity for market disruption. Recommendations for additional data collection and clarification are suggested as next steps to continue assessing and supporting the capacity for DKT Nigeria&#x2019;s disruptive innovation for Sayana Press uptake.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Purpose: To compare dental treatment costs for three pharmacologic behavior guidance modalities&#x2014;dental office-based moderate sedation (SED), hospital-based general anesthesia (GA-H), and dental office-based general anesthesia (GA-OFF).Methods: Data were collected for healthy children ages 2-6 who had full mouth rehabilitation using GA-H at the UNC Children&#x2019;s Hospital. Patients served as their own controls to compare costs across the three modalities. Rendered treatments were quantified using Relative Value Units (RVUs). Costs included opportunity costs and administrative data. We relied upon Ordinary Least Squares analyses to examine the relationship between total costs and RVUs.Results: Of 200 consecutive hospital records, 65 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 4.4 (range 2-6; 41 ASA I, 24 ASA II). Dental treatment using GA-H averaged 1 hour 58 minutes (range 1:02-4:16) with a mean of 12 (range 6-20) teeth treated.  GA-H costs were 4.1 times greater than GA-OFF costs (range 1.1-4.9), and 4.5 times SED costs (range 0.9-7.1); GA-OFF costs were 1.1 times SED costs (range 0.7-1.6).Conclusions: Treatment completed (RVUs) was correlated highest with costs for SED and least for GA-H.  If more than four SED appointments are needed, GA-OFF may provide cost-savings; however, at no point does GA-H offer cost-savings.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Engagement between traditional and private equity stakeholders in emerging global health care markets</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Rising incomes and epidemiological transitions in emerging global health care markets (EGHCM) have contributed to increased demand for health services that surpass public sector capacity. Resource gaps have created new health care opportunities, and the private for-profit sector is rapidly increasing its level of activity in selected markets. Following the path of private health care delivery, private equity (PE) firms are targeting investments that increase private health system capacity, such as improving health facility infrastructure and the workforce. These investments and activities are often met with resistance by traditional global health stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to explore engagement between traditional, private for-profit and PE stakeholders as a means of promoting intersections of goals and strategies. The EGHCM landscape is viewed through three themes: (1) emerging health market trends; (2) indicators of preparedness for for-profit health care delivery/PE investment; and (3) investment strategy themes. A literature review utilized multiple sources including PubMed, EBSCOhost Global Health databases and miscellaneous and gray results. This review resulted in 230 database sources. India is used as a case example of the emerging health care landscape. To assess stakeholder engagement, interviews were conducted with informants from traditional and for-profit/PE backgrounds. The EGHCM landscape and expert insights lay a foundation for a map of engagement and recommendations to enable improved interaction and alignment between stakeholders.The for-profit private sector and influence of PE has played an increasingly significant role in EGHCM. It is crucial to have traditional stakeholders and newer actors engage in a meaningful manner to align health care strategies. Achieving better engagement provides a necessary pathway for collectively working towards shared goals for improved health outcomes and impact.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Association Between Information Source and Use of Modern Contraceptive Methods: Analysis by Gender in Colombia 2015-2016</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: In Colombia, one of every five women younger than 19 years old has been pregnant. Despite governmental efforts to increase healthy sexual behaviors, related outcomes are not as good as expected. Before the 2015-16 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) there was no information about use of modern contraceptive methods in men. This study aims to assess the relationship between the place where information about contraception is received and use of modern methods, and whether this relationship varies by gender.Methods: This study analyzed secondary data from the 2015-2016 Colombian DHS. People who were actively trying to get pregnant, were sterile, or had never had sex were excluded. A weighted multivariate logistic regression assessed the relationship between information source and use of modern contraceptive methods by gender.Results: Ceteris paribus, men were more likely to report using modern contraception methods than women (OR=2.79, 95% CI 2.54 &#x2013; 3.07). The most frequent information source for men and women were educational institutions (57.67% and 56.67%, respectively); however, the predicted probabilities of using modern contraceptive methods was higher for both when information was received in healthcare facilities compared to family, educational institutions, friends, and other sources, although only statistically different for women.Conclusion: Although sexual healthcare services have historically targeted women, use of modern contraceptive methods is significantly lower among women compared to men. Even though educational institutions were a frequent source of information about contraception, their effectiveness in promoting use of modern contraceptive methods is not as high as that of healthcare facilities. A policy that combines efforts from both information sources could increase the probability of using modern methods in Colombian men and women.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Objective: Mapping the options and opportunities in the workforce development space to support the increasing number of companies that seek to engage with their communities in this way, leading to the implementation of impactful programs. Ultimately, the objective is that at-risk youth in the United States will experience improved long-term health outcomes due to increased employment, education, and income after participating in these programs.Methods: This study consisted of two components: 1) A literature review to identify the types of partnerships, both successful and unsuccessful, being used to deliver vocational training to disadvantaged youth aged 16-24 with the goal of increasing their employment opportunity and income. 2) Stakeholder interviews to further explain trends in the structure of successful programs. Interviews were conducted with eight program leaders and four policy experts.Results: There are five macro-level goals for workforce development programs implemented in the United States. Within that framework, programs must decide how to structure themselves based on six fundamental dimensions: intermediary, targeted groups, scale, focus, funding, and private sector participation. All program types face some of the same challenges and opportunities, but program strengths also vary based on the structural decisions they&#x2019;ve made. Key themes include: 1) Programs with the strongest private sector partnerships are proactive about changing employer mentalities. 2) Programs that achieve strong employer engagement do so by presenting them with a viable business case. However, few programs have dedicated adequate attention to funding sustainability. 3) Regardless of what type of intermediary is leading the program, engagement from both the educational system and business community is key. 4) While grant funding is critical to most programs, they should consider how it complicates their missions. 5) Few programs are incorporating any metrics related to health, which represents an area of opportunity for those seeking a holistic approach.Conclusion: There are many different ways successful workforce development programs serving at-risk youth can be structured, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. There are several important choices that must be made when developing a program, and each one has different trade-offs which will cause programs to be more or less geared towards certain participant groups.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A systematic review on the impact of reference pricing on drug expenditure and drug use, and its potential roles in U.S. health system</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Prescription drugs are major components of health care costs. Given rising pharmaceutical expenditures and the widespread use of reference pricing as a cost containment instrument abroad, I systematically reviewed the evidence evaluating reference pricing policies.  I performed a structured electronic search of peer-reviewed journals for studies published that reported on the effects of reference pricing policies on payer and patient expenditures, drug utilizations and healthcare service utilization.  My search produced 36 studies describing 22 reference-pricing policies from 15 countries. Reference-pricing policies led to decreases in payer and patient spending on prescription drugs by inducing a shift in drug use towards less expensive drugs. In addition, I found no evidence of adverse effects on health and an increased use of medical services, such as physician office visits and hospitalization, in the long term. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patient drug expenditures and patient health outcomes were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported. These results suggest that reference pricing may be an attractive policy strategy for the United States (U.S.) healthcare system. A value-based pricing model could be used for innovative drugs. A therapeutic reference pricing system could be implemented for the &#x201C;me-too&#x201D; drugs and generic drugs whereby a reference price would be set for new products of comparable clinical effectiveness. The mechanisms of introducing reference pricing in the U.S. healthcare system will add complexity to patient benefit plans, which may also undermine the benefits that the policy strategy offers.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Program Evaluation: A Joint Venture between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) at the Fayetteville Rehabilitation Clinic (FRC)</dc:title>

          <dc:description>BACKGROUND: Rehabilitative care services, like physical, speech, and occupational therapy (PT/SP/OT), are critical to sustaining military readiness and, at the same time, to Veteran health to prevent injury or further loss of mobility. In 2013, Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) and Fayetteville North Carolina Veteran Affairs Medical Center (FNCVAMC) submitted a Joint Incentive Funding (JIF) proposal to create a shared outpatient rehabilitation clinic, known as the Fayetteville Rehabilitation Clinic (FRC), with the intent of reducing purchased care expenditures, recapturing workload in the direct care system, improving appointment wait times, and enhancing the continuity of care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate from the federal government perspective the extent DoD and VA are achieving the JIF program objectives for Active Duty, military dependents, Retirees, and eligible Veterans seeking rehabilitative care services by increasing direct care capacity at the FRC.PARTICIPANTS: Womack AMC, Fayetteville VAMC, and FRC staff.APPROACH: The evaluation uses The Donabedian Model of Care &#x201C;structure-process-outcomes&#x201D; conceptual framework and non-experimental time series pre-test/post-test design to observe trends in access, quality, and value between FY13-FY18 year to date (YTD). Specifically, observations and trends related to purchased care expenditures, direct and purchased care encounters, and appointment wait times were analyzed for both Womack AMC and Fayetteville VAMC before and after the FRC opened in June 2017. MAIN RESULTS: Womack AMC and Fayetteville VAMC may reduce combined purchased care expenditures by approximately $4.5 million ($4.3 million and $166K respectively), which is on par with the JIF proposal&#x2019;s $2.4 million estimate. However, purchased care expenditures will always exist due to the DoD&#x2019;s readiness mission and the constraint that neither DoD nor VA can provide an exhausted list of specialized services and must subsequently seek care in the private sector. Despite having increased patient encounters, Womack AMC&#x2019;s appointment wait times across all beneficiary types (Active Duty, family members, Retirees) have remained steady between 11.7 to 12.4 days, while Fayetteville VAMC&#x2019;s appointment wait times vary greatly between new and established patients, but have declined since the implementation of the Veterans Choice Program in FY14. CONCLUSIONS: Providing joint DoD/VA rehabilitative care services within the direct care system contributes to the overall reduction in purchased care expenditures, workload referred to the private network, and appointment wait times, while enhancing collaboration and provider skill sets for both parties by servicing a broader population of patients.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC EVIDENCE OF WEB AND MOBILE-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS TREATMENT: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: Web- and mobile-based technologies (WBM) are often assumed to be cost-effective because they reduce health care visits and eliminate access barriers. In addition, mental disorders make up a substantial proportion of the world&#x2019;s disease and economic burden. The aim of this report is to assess and summarize the literature related to economic evaluations of web- and mobile-based interventions for the severe mental illness population. Methods: Five databases were searched for economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to assess reporting quality and the Cochrane Collaboration&#x2019;s Risk of Bias tool to evaluate the risk of bias for the included economic evaluations. The PRISMA guidelines were followed.Results: Findings show that 70% of the WBM interventions strongly dominated were less costly and more effective than the comparator or control. Only one study conducted a WBM intervention that was dominated by the comparator because the intervention was costlier and less effective. However, quality of reporting and risk of bias within each study varied.Conclusions: The findings show that WBM for severe mental illnesses may be cost-effective compared to usual care treatment, and may result in substantial cost-savings to society. Regardless the setting, however, it is pertinent that future economic evaluations use high quality reporting techniques, eliminating the barriers for decision-makers to assess whether the evidence is generalizable and relevant to their local setting.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>High mental health stigma in Hispanic is an area of study that requires more attention. There are significant gaps in research on this subject. This is especially true among Hispanic adolescents who are still developing and are in an influential part of their life. Hispanic adolescents have higher rates of considering suicide, making suicide plans, and actually attempting suicide than white adolescents.  There are several reasons why individuals might not seek treatment from a provider. A serious reason is that many experience high mental health stigma. Fearing or experiencing negative labels associated with having a mental illness can lead to individuals refusing to seek treatment.1. Latinos are also less likely seek mental health services compared to other ethnicities or races. Interventions that can help lessen mental health stigma in adolescents may help in increasing treatment rates. The pilot program proposed is based on the SPEAK program by Bulanda et al. (2014). With the aid of the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation, this program will be adapted to Hispanic adolescents. The primary goal of this program is to reduce mental health stigma.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Provision of Medical Care in Local County and City Jails: A comparison of healthcare delivery in Virginia and West Virginia</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This report aims to inform policy makers, public health officials and jail administrators about how healthcare is structured, delivered and financed in local county and city jail facilities. Specifically, how medical care is provided in local jail facilities in Virginia and West Virginia.  This is an area where limited academic research has been conducted, making it difficult for policy makers and jail administrators to understand how healthcare should be best provided to inmates. Every year millions of Americans cycle through our local jail systems. In 2016 alone, there were over 10.6 million admissions to jails (Zeng, 2018). Most of these stays are temporary with jails turning over roughly half of their inmate population weekly (Zeng, 2018).  This presents unique challenges for local jail administrators as they work towards ensuring their core mission of protecting the safety of the public and the secure confinement of individuals under their jurisdiction (&#x201C;Federal Bureau of Prisons,&#x201D; n.d.) and (Blakley, 2010). Under the 8th amendment inmates have a constitutional right to healthcare and jail administrators are compelled to provide adequate care to all inmates under their jurisdiction (&#x201C;The Origin of Prisoner's Rights,&#x201D; 2016). Making this operational for a constantly shifting population is a challenge, especially when considering that jail inmates are often in poorer health than the general population (Marks, 2014). For this report, I reviewed the academic and grey literature in this area, compared how healthcare is delivered in Virginia and West Virginia (adjacent states with contrasting jail facility organization and publicly available jail healthcare data), evaluated medical cost data and reviewed private medical vendor contracts and RFPs to determine how care is currently delivered in these states.Private medical vendors can present a way for jail administrators to reduce healthcare delivery challenges, guarantee care and mitigate risk for both budgetary concerns and delivery of care concerns. They provide known healthcare costs allowing for more predictable budgeting, expand access to care with 24/7 healthcare coverage and provide access to additional service lines. In response to services offered by vendors, local governments are becoming more sophisticated in their RFPs. More recent RFPs included request for chronic care management programs, non-proprietary EMR systems, increased mental healthcare and behavioral health staff requirements, reimbursement for care from individual&#x2019;s personal healthcare insurance, compliance with new regulations and risk sharing payment options with vendors. Additional research is needed in this area, especially in areas such as healthcare delivery structure, cost and quality of care. Jail facilities, governments and healthcare providers should share information and data to advance delivery of care across the system. A more centralized or regional jail system may help to decrease cost variability in the future. Local governments should continue to enhance their RFPs and medical vendor contracts to increase service lines, provide better care to inmates and decrease their administrative burden.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Purpose:  As the U.S. population ages and older adults increasingly expect to &#x201C;age in place,&#x201D; the need for long-term care is expected to rise and the demand for home- and community-based supports is expected to rise. However, limitations in physical functioning are a major barrier to aging-in place for many older adults. Evidence suggests that assistive home modifications, including modifications to improve safety and mobility within the home, can help improve physical functioning among older adults. This study will aim to examine the association between home modifications and decline in physical functioning or risk of falls over time among older Americans.Methods: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, this study examines the association between obtaining at least one home modification and decline in function, incidence of falls, and likelihood of having a fall with injury over time. A total of 5,694 community-dwelling older adults were included in the study sample. Logistic regression was used to estimate individual-level characteristics associated with obtaining a home modification, and fixed-effects regressions were used to estimate the association between having a home modification and limitations in performing activities of daily living (ADLs), number of falls, and likelihood of having a fall with injury.Results: People who were older, female, had worse self-reported health, and not renting their residence were more likely to obtain assistive home modifications. Home modifications were associated with having difficulty with more ADLs and more falls. Having safety-related modifications was associated with worse falls-related outcomes compared to mobility-related modifications.  Conclusions: This study suggests that older adults who obtain home modifications experience more decline in physical function and falls over time. This estimated association likely represents confounding between the timing of declines in functional status and subsequent home modifications to prevent further decline, rather than a true negative effect of home modifications on health. Further research and more detailed data will be needed to determine the long-term effects of home modifications on functional status, falls, and other outcomes that may impair the ability of older adults to age in place. The results of this analysis also indicate that individuals who obtain home modifications are in worse overall health, suggesting that they may benefit from other interventions and supports.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Nearly a quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries treated in a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) experience a hospital transfer within three months of admission to the facility.  These readmissions are costly, pervasive and often avoidable.  Telemedicine represents one solution to this problem, however utilization of the innovation, both across the industry and within facilities that have installed the innovation, remains low.Understanding common barriers and &#x201C;organizational readiness&#x201D; for implementing within this setting is necessary in order to optimize the chance of successful adoption and integration.  However, few theory-based studies exist explicitly evaluating organizational readiness in this setting. This study seeks to bridge that gap.  In this study we adapted an existing conceptual model of organizational readiness to create a readiness assessment that was then deployed at three facilities, analyzing the assessment's predictive validity by comparison to actual telehealth utilization data.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Objective: Examine the online industry for kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant-based substance used by Americans as an opioid alternative, and provide context to the market amidst regulatory attempts by the Food and Drug Administration and numerous state legislatures.  Methods: Using search results collected from the three most widely used search engines, 663 websites were identified selling kratom products to US consumers. The top 100 most visited online vendors were selected and the content of their website and social media profiles were coded for topics including location, payment and shipping options, age verification, health warnings and disclaimers, grassroots advocacy regarding upcoming state and federal regulations, and response to the recent kratom-linked Salmonella outbreak.  Results:  25% of vendors made claims that kratom provided relief from opioid withdrawal. 81% of vendors featured a disclaimer that kratom is addictive, with 54% stating that the product is not FDA approved. Only 5% of vendors utilized effective age verification through confirming age on delivery or use of a third party online database. Enforcement of state and locality bans on the vendor's part varied by location; 65% vendors did not sell to Indiana whereas only 27% prohibited sales to Rhode Island. Conclusions:  The kratom internet vendor industry (KIV) was found to have low adherence to US state-level restrictions on the products&#x2019; purchase. There is a high prevalence of health claims featured on vendor webpages that are discouraged by the Food and Drug Administration.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Moving Towards Medicare for All: Lessons from International Single-Payer Systems for the United States</dc:title>
          <dc:date>2018-05-01T04:00:00Z</dc:date>

          <dc:description>The United States is the only rich democratic country that does not have a universal healthcare system. In other nations, all (or nearly all) individuals receive health care directly from government programs or are covered by public insurance programs or heavily regulated private insurance. Even with the ACA, about 30 million Americans remain uninsured. In addition, the US spends more on healthcare than any other nation and has poor population health outcomes (Etehad, 2017). With the introduction of the Expanded &amp; Improved Medicare for All Act (H.R. 676) in the House of Representatives and the Medicare for All bill (S.1804) in the Senate in 2017, Democrats have laid the foundations for a potential path to a single-payer system in the US. In 2018, the Center for American Progress released its plan, Medicare Extra For All. It differs from current single-payer legislation by expanding Medicare Advantage but making the purchase of coverage from the US government optional. This plan would also maintain employer and private insurance, and require patient cost-sharing (CAP, 2018). Despite current proposals&#x2019; poor prospects for passage right now, the debate over a single-payer system is likely to intensify in the run-up to the 2020 election. Support for Medicare for All is growing among Congressional Democrats. S. 1804 has 16 co-sponsors and H.R. 676 has 120, respectively. Public support, too, is growing. In a poll by the Pew Research Center in June 2017, 60% of the public believes that the federal government is responsible for ensuring that every American is provided with health care coverage, and 33% now favor a single-payer approach; up 12 percentage points since 2014 (Kiley, 2017). In a similar poll, the Kaiser Family Foundation (2017) reported a modest increase in support for a single-payer health plan from 50% to 53% between 2016 and 2017. An April, 2018 poll from the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation showed similar results but indicated that nearly 75% of Democrats and 54% of Independents now support a single-payer system (Guskin, 2018). Considering the rising prominence of Medicare for All and the potential implications of 2020, it is possible to imagine that the US could begin the process of moving towards a single-payer system in coming years. If a single-payer system becomes a serious option, it will be important to grapple with design choices in operationalizing a Medicare for All system. As US reformers contemplate these choices, they can learn much from other nations&#x2019; experiences with single-payer arrangements. The goal of this study is to consider lessons from the experiences of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Taiwan in operating their single-payer systems. These systems were chosen in order to explore how a single-payer arrangement works in a variety of settings. Their successes and failures give us the opportunity to learn about the challenges of operating a single-payer system which could give reformers insight into how a Medicare For All system could be designed. Lessons on the adjustment of revenue streams, the evolution of cost controls, efforts in delivery reform and quality improvement, and the role of private insurance are critical to considering the design of our own single-payer system. By highlighting the tradeoffs made in other nation&#x2019;s arrangements, lessons will be identified in order to make recommendations for a single-payer system in the US.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The objective of this paper is to compare the costs and benefits of funding North Carolina&#x2019;s adult Medicaid dental benefits. First, a literature review was conducted on the scope of adult Medicaid dental benefits and dental-related emergency department(ED) visits. Second, the costs of dental care in the ED was compared to the cost of care at a private dental office. A decision tree was used to model North Carolina&#x2019;s Medicaid cohort&#x2019;s utilization of dental benefits. The primary outcome of interest was the change in costs associated with an ED visit for dental-related conditions when dental benefits are funded and not funded. The results can inform North Carolina General Assembly&#x2019;s decision about whether to continue to fund adults&#x2019; Medicaid dental benefits. The results can further inform the shortcomings in current dental care access across North Carolina.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Recovery plans developed in the wake of Hurricane Matthew document widespread damage to drinking water and wastewater systems in eastern North Carolina. Despite the strong interest in creating more resilient systems after the storm, local Hazard Mitigation Plans (HMPs) developed before Hurricane Matthew provided little insight into the drinking water and wastewater system components at risk from flooding and how this risk could affect community vulnerability. This report includes a tool for evaluating water and wastewater system resilience in HMPs and provides recommendations for future plan updates.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: The first 5 years of a child&#x2019;s life are important for the development of motor, social, emotional, cognitive and communication skills. Children from low-income backgrounds often perform worse in language, reading and math when compared to their peers from less disadvantaged backgrounds. This often leads to an educational gap that persists throughout their entire school experience. Objective: To determine the educational and health benefits of early education intervention programs in preschool settings designed for low-income children from birth to age 5. Methods: A systematic literature search using Pubmed and Cochrane databases was conducted for studies published through April 8, 2017 that assessed early education intervention programs for children from low-income environments. Results: A total of 11 articles were included in the review. These 11 articles contained 5 primary studies that utilized early education interventions. Three studies presented results from a longitudinal project at years 5, 15 and 1915-17. Two studies presented results from a similar longitudinal study, the first at time periods from 6 &#x2013; 21 years and the second results at year 3013,14. Three studies directly assessed the effectiveness of Head Start programs18-20. Two studies presented a cost-benefit analysis of two separate early education interventions and the last study provided a summary of findings on educational and cognitive outcomes. Children enrolled in early intervention programs scored better on measured achievements in reading and math at school entry and completed more total years of education (13.46 years for intervention group, N =409 vs 12.31 years for control group, N = 507; college degree or higher, odds ratio OR 4.6, P &amp;lt; 0.05). They also scored higher on intelligence scales (IQ mean 103 for intervention group, N = 57 vs IQ mean 92 for the non-intervention group N = 54) (p value or confidence interval not reported). As adults, they were more likely to report their health as very good or excellent when compared to those who did not receive early education interventions, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant (69% vs 59%, p=0.29); neither group was very likely to report symptoms consistent with mental health diagnoses (9.6% intervention, N = 52 and 6.1% non-intervention, N = 49) (OR 1.63, p = 0.52).  Conclusions: For children from low income backgrounds, participation in early education interventions demonstrates improved school outcomes such as better standardized test scores, higher rates of grade promotion and more completed educational years. It also shows improved cognitive ability as demonstrated by higher IQ scores. In adulthood, there may be improvements in self-reported health but sample sizes were relatively small and results imprecise. Limitations: Few primary studies were identified (5). External factors that are unable to be controlled, such as family commitment to education and the quality of primary education teachers, could have led to bias in the results.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This descriptive study returned to the 22 participant institutions of the ASIANetwork / Luce Asian Art Consultancy program (2005&#x2013;2008) to question the narrative of Japanese woodblock prints through the organization and accessibility of their collections. As this study was concerned with implicit ontologies and not officially articulated meanings, all data was collected through content analysis of the manifest content of digital object records and collection organization.Following the analysis of 22 collections and 30 individual records, this study found that the narrative remains silent for 12 of the 22 institutions &#x2013; their collections had no digital presence. For the other 10 institutions, existing records were riddled with inconsistent, incorrect, and westocentrically-framed information. Though the scope of this project was narrow, this study can provide a model for questioning constructions of value, cultural exclusion, and the unintended narratives that unfold through the organization and accessibility of art collections.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Over the past few decades, a sizeable body of library and information science literature has pointed to the inadequacies of traditional cataloging and classification systems for describing material related to marginalized communities. At the same time, alternative metadata systems have proliferated in online environments and social tagging has become almost ubiquitous. Focused specifically on the retrieval of LGBTQ+-related recreational reading materials, this study used an online survey to assess the utility of traditional library systems in comparison with the utility of the user-moderated folksonomy employed in the Archive of Our Own (AO3) fanwork repository. Results indicated that respondents, who were generally comfortable in both the library and Archive environments, preferred using AO3 to access LGBTQ+ material and perceived the tagging system to be of greater value in search processes than typical subject access mechanisms. Several possible avenues for improving current systems emerge in the conclusion of the paper.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper aims to discover what librarians thought about Open Access Textbooks: namely what criteria they felt was pertinent to help users make an informed decision about their resource. Affordability and access to education materials is ideal in a world which aims to provide certain human rights, i.e. education. Prior to this research, no research existed pertaining to librarian&#x2019;s opinions about essential metadata. Thus, librarians were shown a rubric and asked to evaluate each criterion ranging from title information to user friendliness on the web. It was discovered, that much of this information was valuable in determining which criteria were most useful to a user.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>&#x201C;Why Would She Want to Read About Such Horrible Things?&#x201D;: The Appeal of War as a Reading Interest for Girls</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Reading appeal research has historically identified war as a topic of reading interest that correlates strongly with gender. Boys are traditionally much more likely than girls to read books involving war, and many girls prefer to avoid the topic. At the same time, research has consistently found smaller but significant numbers of girls who choose to read in this subject area. Using qualitative analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this study explored the appeal factors at play for five 11- and 12-year-old children who identify as girls (four in whole, one in part) who enjoy reading about war.Traditional reading appeal factors that were sought by these readers included action-packed storylines, an attention-grabbing writing style, fast or intensifying pacing, courageous characters, and a dramatic, suspenseful tone. Learning about historical events played an important role for readers of historical fiction, while fantasy fans were drawn to the presence of strong female characters working alongside males in an adventurous storyline. Gender issues pervaded the discussion, revealing feelings of powerlessness and inequality. Several participants reported benefits that aligned with outcomes associated with bibliotherapy as well as closer connections to men in their lives. The results of this study can support librarians in providing gender-transformative readers&#x2019; advisory services and assist other researchers in understanding gender dynamics in the middle grade years.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Impacts of Brownfield Redevelopment on Neighborhood Change: A Case Study of Durham North Carolina</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Initiatives by state and federal government agencies have sought to incentivize brownfield redevelopment in order to revitalize communities. Brownfield redevelopment has been shown to increase property values of surrounding properties, reduce environmental and health risks, provide amenities for disadvantaged communities, and catalyze sustainable development in distressed areas. In spite of these benefits, community members have expressed concerns about displacement of long term residents that result following brownfield redevelopment, many of whom are low-income and from minority populations.  Durham, North Carolina is one of the fastest growing cities in the state of North Carolina. Vacant brownfield sites that remain from the city&#x2019;s once thriving manufacturing industry have provided development opportunities throughout Durham. The Project investigated whether brownfield redevelopment increases property values for surrounding properties, and whether brownfield redevelopment has contributed to neighborhood change in the city of Durham.The Project analyzed property tax assessments and census block group demographic indicators from the years 2000, 2010, and 2016 surrounding 16 redeveloped brownfield sites and 9 identified brownfield sites, which were used as the control group. Based on existing literature on brownfield redevelopment, the study hypothesized that property values and demographic indicators would be altered as brownfield sites are redeveloped. Using an areal apportionment distance based analysis, the study found that property values within 0.125 miles and 0.25 miles of redeveloped brownfield sites increased. Furthermore, the study found that changes in demographic indicators surrounding redeveloped brownfield sites between 2000 and 2016, such as median household income and bachelor&#x2019;s degree attainment, showed statistical significance.Limitations to the study included a uniform population concentration around census block groups for the areal apportionment distance based analysis, which assumes uniform distributions in a census block group rather than considering actual spatial orientation or residents, and the Economic Crisis of 2008 which impacted indicators such as household income and poverty rates outside of the scope of the study. Furthermore, clustering of redeveloped brownfield sites in close proximity to identified brownfield sites may have confounded indicator quantities. In spite of these shortcomings, the Project provided an integral step in investigating neighborhood change as a result of brownfield redevelopment in southern, historically industrial cities such as Durham, North Carolina and how it impacts marginalized populations.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to assess beliefs on the effects of telepsychiatry on the process of care and outcomes for patients, whether current data are suited to assessing the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program, and providing next steps for the program&#x2019;s evaluation. MethodsThrough conversations with stakeholders, literature review and analysis of NC-STeP presentations, information was drawn to build a process flow diagram. The process flow diagram was used to create a framework for assessing the program in the future. Results The results show that while NC-STeP claims to have improved patient measures like length of stay and involuntary commitments, there is a gap in data to study the efficacy and cost savings of the program. ConclusionWith a refined process flow diagram and improved data, we can use simulation modeling techniques like queuing to understand the costs and benefits of NC-STeP. Telehealth interventions are only growing in the modern approach to urban-rural disparities, making assessment increasingly important.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Few studies have examined the digital curation practices of audiovisual materials from the perspective of the digital object lifecycle. With a plethora of existing video content and more being produced at a steady rate, it is important that repositories have a plan for the long-term digital preservation of their video assets. Of particular interest is audiovisual preservation outside of academic repositories. In this case study, the digital curation strategies of two non-academic repositories handling digital video assets were analyzed in relation to the digital object lifecycle. Findings from these cases provide insight into real-world practice and suggest that digital preservation planning in these environments requires more attention.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper evaluated the usability of two VR displays (head mounted display and a mobile phone VR holder) by using six metrics: ease of use, engagement, emotion, comprehension, enjoyment, and comfortableness. The paper also evaluated different focusing techniques for 360 videos and provided a recommendation for future work. A total of 20 participants (10 participants for each subject) participated in this study, and all of the participants were recruited from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The quantitative result was evaluated by the six metrics and the qualitative data from the interview responses were used to help interpret the results. The results showed there was no significant difference between two devices when it comes to watching 360 videos in general. However, there was significance in individual measurements like comprehension and enjoyment level, which were affected by tasks and devices.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This paper evaluates UNC-Chapel Hill&#x2019;s One ACT and One ACT for Greeks trainings.  These trainings empower undergraduate peer educators to teach fellow students bystander skills to intervene in interpersonal violence situations. This paper uses random effects and differences in differences models to evaluate changes in confidence to intervene as a bystander, reported likelihood to intervene as a bystander, and missed opportunities to intervene as a bystander for 1,422 training participants before and after the training for program years 2013-2017.  The results show that after participating in One ACT and One ACT for Greeks trainings respondents report significant improvements in bystander confidence, reported likelihood to intervene, and missed bystander intervention behaviors pre-test to post-test.  There are not significant differences in these outcomes for One ACT versus One ACT for Greeks respondents.  This paper also explores how these outcomes vary by race/ethnicity. Finally, this paper summarizes programmatic and policy recommendations based on these results.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Unequal access to care and inadequate health care utilization are the main determinants of cancer care disparities. I aimed to identify differences in the effect of disparities in stage at diagnosis among patients with a cancer in which screening is widely recommended (colorectal cancer CRC) and one in which it is not (esophageal cancer).I performed a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database during the period 2004-2015, including adult patients (&#x2265;18 years old) diagnosed with esophageal or CRC. I used multivariable generalized logistic regression to identify potential differences in the effect of disparities in stage at diagnosis.My resulting analytical sample included a total of 96,524 esophageal cancer patients and 361,187 CRC patients. Black patients were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV only in CRC (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.30, 1.37). Similarly, longer travel distances and lower educational attainment were only associated with increased odds of stage IV CRC (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.17, 1.23 and 1.11, 95%CI 1.07, 1.15, respectively). While both Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured patients were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV esophageal cancer (OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.21, 1.47 and 1.99, 95%CI 1.72, 2.31) and stage IV CRC (OR 1.94, 95%CI 1.86, 2.02 and 2.33 95%CI 2.21, 2.46,) than were patients with private insurance, the effect was larger among CRC patients. From 2004 to 2015, the rates of stage IV esophageal cancer fell from 42.0% to 38.2%, while the rates of stage IV CRC increased from 36.9% to 40.8% (p&amp;lt;0.0001).In conclusion, this analysis of a national database suggests that racial and socioeconomic disparities are more pronounced in CRC than in esophageal cancer. Equity in access to screening and cancer care should be prioritized to reduce health disparities.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Moral Distress as a Characteristic of Physician Training: Understanding and Ameliorating a Harmful Phenomenon</dc:title>

          <dc:description>When health care providers experience moral distress, it influences not only their wellness, but that of their patients. Although moral distress in health care is believed to be universal, the majority of literature on the topic describes the experiences of nurses. Moral distress among physician trainees is poorly understood. In this study, I report the findings of a systematic review of studies of moral distress experienced by physician trainees. I reviewed three key questions: (1) What are the root causes of moral distress (clinical situations, internal constraints, and external constraints) in physician trainees? (2) Is the experience of moral distress influenced by a physician trainee&#x2019;s gender, subspecialty, or level of training? (3) How do physician trainees cope with their moral distress? I screened 1492 articles for eligibility; 38 articles met criteria for full-text review. The final qualitative analysis included eight studies. Five studies employed qualitative methods and three studies used quantitative methods. I could not perform a quantitative synthesis of the 8 appraised articles. The most commonly identified clinical situations leading to moral distress were &#x201C;powerlessness due to position in the hierarchy,&#x201D; &#x201C;witnessing unprofessional/unethical/substandard conduct or scenarios,&#x201D; and &#x201C;caring for critically ill patients at the end-of-life.&#x201D; The most common form of adaptive coping reported was open discussions among staff involved with specific cases. The most common form of maladaptive coping reported was depersonalization. Few studies explored the relationship between moral distress and demographic characteristics. Of the five qualitative studies, the majority were of moderate quality. All three quantitative studies were of low or very low quality. High quality research that enables us to understand the best ways to identify, respond to, and prevent moral distress among physician trainees will support their wellbeing and may be helpful for curriculum development.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Health care-associated venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE) leads to significant costs, morbidity, and mortality. Health care systems can prevent these patient safety events using prophylactic methods and systems of care. Medical students could help identify patients requiring HA-VTE prophylaxis on the wards. This paper expounds a research study design for a patient safety educational intervention involving medical students in this role.Methods: We will give third-year medical students on inpatient medicine rotations a card to carry in their white coats to help remind them of VTE risk stratification, prophylaxis choice, and words to use with superiors when safety issues arise. This will be incorporated into a series of lectures given during the rotation, covering topics such as VTE prophylaxis, patient safety, systems thinking, and navigating hierarchies. Medical students will bring their knowledge and their cards onto the wards, enabling them to raise patient safety concerns regarding VTE prophylaxis to their teams. Students will then submit descriptions of the &#x201C;near miss&#x201D; events. We will also assess changes among medical students in attitude and self-reported knowledge through the Attitudes to Patient Safety Questionnaire.Discussion: The literature that ties medical student patient safety educational interventions to outcomes involving patient benefit is lacking. This study involves a simple design in an attempt to measure patient-related outcomes and student attitudes and self-reported knowledge. The study is feasible based on discussions and a trial with medical students. Limitations to the study include lacking connection to a patient health outcome along with under-emphasis of potential harms of VTE prophylaxis.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>The Mexico City Policy prohibits United States aid to foreign non-governmental organizations from spending any of their funds on abortion services, education, or referral.  The United States has repeatedly enacted and repealed this policy along partisan lines, perhaps at times without regard for its possible health and economic effects.  I examined the role of the Mexico City Policy on the Maternal Mortality Ratio, a marker of maternal health that, in 2000, the World Health Organization pledged to reduce.  This study suggests that the Mexico City Policy may play a role in affecting the maternal mortality ratio differently across developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.  This study serves as a preliminary analysis for exploration of this policy on maternal mortality.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Early identification of children/adolescent with gender dysphoria results in early referral to mental health professionals, referrals to endocrinology, and the formation of a multidisciplinary team to support the child and their family. This cascade of events leads to improvement in health outcomes. At present, no guidelines recommend when physicians should begin asking their patients about sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) questions. In addition, no guidelines exist on how to approach asking these questions and the method of delivery of these questions. Aim: This study aims to give guidance to physicians about when to start asking SOGI questions, which method to use, how to frame and approach these questions, and how to introduce them in the most patient-centered way. Methods: This study used an anonymous paper and pencil questionnaire to survey a sample of pediatric patients in the UNC Endocrine's Pediatric and Adolescent Gender Clinic and in the UNC Children&#x2019;s Primary Care Clinic. This study had three primary outcomes: how to approach asking SOGI questions, participants&#x2019; preferences about SOGI questioning, and the best wording to use when asking such questions.  Results: Twenty-two pediatric patients consented to participating in the survey during the study period.  The average age of participants was 14.53 (+/-1.63). The study participants were mostly assigned the sex at birth of female (68%) and white (43%). A majority of participants identified their current gender as either female (41%) or male (41%) and their sexual identity as straight (59%) based on the multiple choice question. In total, 36% of participants identified as a gender minority and 55% identified as a sexual orientation minority based on the multiple choice question. Participants&#x2019; preferences about SOGI questions included wanting to be asked about gender identity (71%) and sexual orientation (67%) in the 13-16 years old time frame. Participants wanted their physician to be the one to ask SOGI questions (88%). Participants preferred the multiple choice method for both gender identity (71%) and sexual orientation (59%) questions. None of the preference variables were statistically significantly associated with how participants identified their gender or sexual orientation. &#x201C;On paper without parent present&#x201D; was the approach for delivering SOGI questions that received the most top ranks (56%). Conclusion: This study shows that pediatric patients would like their doctor to begin asking SOGI questions between the ages of 13 and 16 years without their parent/guardian present in the room. These questions should be delivered on paper or electronically. The best method to ask these questions whether it is multiple choice, using the Trevor Spectrum, or adopting another method, requires further research.  Although we have preliminary data about pediatric patients&#x2019; preferences for SOGI questions, the results emphasize the need for future larger scale studies. This would allow us to gain a more robust sample size that could be used to develop more concrete conclusions.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>A growing body of literature shows that although medical students start their journey to becoming a physician with similar self-reported mental health outcomes as those of their non-medical peers, they finish their training in poorer mental health.  Research on the topic of medical student mental health and wellbeing has found higher rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality among medical students than in the general population, although exact estimates vary by study.  A high quality systematic review with meta-analysis of the data on the prevalence of these disorders in medical schools nationwide would help the medical education community more fully understand the scope of the problem, and design interventions appropriately.  This paper intended to conduct such a review, but limitations in the literature &#x2013; especially the paucity of data on anxiety and suicidality - make such synthesis and analysis difficult, if not impossible.  This paper presents the findings of the literature review, comments on the gaps and limitations of the evidence, and poses recommendations aimed at improving the quality of the research surrounding medical student mental health.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Increasing Incidence of Appendiceal Cancer: Hidden Complications of Non-Operative Management of Acute Appendicitis</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Introduction: There has been a recent interest in the pursuit of non-operative management (NOM) of acute appendicitis in both pediatric and adult populations. One potential harm of NOM is overlooking cases of appendiceal cancer, a rare and often aggressive malignancy due to the frequency of late stage at diagnosis. Previous studies have reported an increasing incidence of appendiceal neoplasms in the population. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the incidence of primary appendiceal neoplasm among patients who presented with signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis at the University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital (UNC-MH) from 2011 to 2015. Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study of patients at UNC-MH who were treated with appendectomy for acute appendicitis. We evaluated the incidence of primary appendiceal cancer over time in this population and completed multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine factors that are associated with appendiceal cancer diagnosis. Results: Of the adult patients at UNC-MH presenting with clinically suspicious acute appendicitis, the incidence of appendiceal neoplasm was 2.8% (6/213) in 2011, 0.9% (2/209) in 2012, 3.0% (6/199) in 2013, 2.4% (4/170) in 2014, and 2.3% (5/216) in 2015. The incidence of appendiceal neoplasm over 5 years was 2.3% (23/1007) in this patient population. When considering only patients without appendiceal perforation on pathology, the incidence of appendiceal neoplasm over 5 years was 1.9% (16/832). Using a multivariate logistic regression, age (OR 1.03), number of days of abdominal pain (OR 1.16), self-reported fever (OR 2.08), appendiceal width (OR 1.95), and appendiceal wall thickness (OR 1.30) are associated with a primary appendiceal neoplasm diagnosis in patients that present with clinical signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis. Conclusions: We recommend that an operative approach to acute appendicitis should remain the standard of care, as operative management may not only be diagnostic but potentially therapeutic.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Multimodal Pain Protocol After Head and Neck Surgery in the Context of the Current Opioid Crisis</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: The United States is in the midst of a public health crisis of prescription opioid addiction, abuse and overdose. Use of narcotic medication in the post-surgical setting may contribute to the problem. Multimodal analgesic plans have the potential to decrease narcotic requirements in patients after surgery; however, there is little prospective data to show efficacy in Head and Neck (H&amp;N) surgery patients. Methods: An IRB approved, quality improvement initiative was undertaken to implement a multimodal analgesic protocol for all H&amp;N surgery patients at a tertiary referral center. The protocol was implemented November 2017 and post-protocol data from January 2018 to May 2018 were compared to pre-protocol data from May 2017 to October 2017. Data were abstracted from the electronic health records as well as through pre-operative and post-operative surveys. Average pain scores and opioid use in Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) before and after protocol implementation were compared.  Results: One-hundred-and-five post-protocol patients were compared to 167 pre-protocol patients. The adjusted median MME in the first 24 hours after surgery decreased significantly from 93.7mg to 58.6mg (p=0.026) with protocol implementation. When averaged over the length of stay (MME/HD), there was no significant change between the pre and post protocol cohort (57.9mg vs 46.8mg, p=0.211) The average pain score immediately after surgery was 3.6 and on the day of discharge was 2.7; neither measure changed with protocol implementation. Conclusion: Our multimodal analgesia plan reduced narcotic use immediately after surgery but not over the course of hospitalization. There was no difference in average reported pain scores. This study shows that implementation of a multimodal narcotic-sparing analgesia plan after H&amp;N surgery is feasible. Future studies will need to further refine the optimal analgesia plan, optimize pain regimens for various patient characteristics and assess the long-term efficacy, safety and cost of such regimens.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: Skin cancer is a major public health burden.  While treatable, early diagnosis usually portends a better prognosis.  Screening is one preventive measure, although the United States Preventive Services Task Force has deemed there to be &#x201C;insufficient evidence&#x201D; for recommendation.  The American Academy of Dermatology has sponsored free, public skin screenings since 1985, but there is minimal data supporting these efforts.  The utility of community screening events in general is debated in the literature.Objective: To determine whether free, public skin cancer screenings are effective for secondary prevention of skin cancer through an analysis of follow-up rates of screening events hosted by the Polka Dot Mama Melanoma Foundation.  To explore the challenges of implementing and measuring effectiveness of a community screening event.Methods: I conducted an observational study using survey data, along with a literature review on the value of community-oriented screening events.Results: Most screening participants were white, female, and 51 to 65 years old.  More than half have had at least one blistering sunburn before age 20 years old and approximately half have used indoor tanning equipment.  Over half of participants surveyed by telephone reported demonstrating sun-protective behaviors since their screening.  Approximately one-third of participants had never seen a dermatologist prior to the screening.  Diagnostic confirmation of four total skin cancers and two precancerous AKs appeared to result from these screening events.Conclusion: Community screenings are primarily helpful insofar as their success can be measured.  It is important to study challenges associated with community screenings for the evaluation and success of future community screening events.  The general sentiment toward skin cancer screenings is mixed, so future studies must focus on whether or not free skin screenings have a positive influence on the community and save lives.</dc:description>

More than half have had at least one blistering sunburn before age 20 years old and approximately half have used indoor tanning equipment.  Over half of participants surveyed by telephone reported demonstrating sun-protective behaviors since their screening.  Approximately one-third of participants had never seen a dermatologist prior to the screening.  Diagnostic confirmation of four total skin cancers and two precancerous AKs appeared to result from these screening events.Conclusion: Community screenings are primarily helpful insofar as their success can be measured.  It is important to study challenges associated with community screenings for the evaluation and success of future community screening events.  The general sentiment toward skin cancer screenings is mixed, so future studies must focus on whether or not free skin screenings have a positive influence on the community and save lives.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: Many public health programs fail because of an inability to implement tested intervention in diverse, complex settings. The emerging field of implementation science is engaged in developing strategies for successful implementation, but current training is narrow and researcher&#x2010;focused. To enable public health practitioners to become &#x201C;chief health strategists&#x201D; as envisioned by Public Health 3.0, practitioners must be trained in implementation and in the allied fields of systems and design thinking, quality improvement, and innovative evaluation methods. UNC&#x2010;Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health created an interdisciplinary set of courses in applied implementation science for MPH students. I describe the conceptual approach, pedagogy, courses, and initial results/learning utilized at Gillings to assist other schools contemplating similar programs, and emphasize the acute need for expanded training opportunities in implementation science practice to prepare public health leaders of the twenty-first century.Methods: Gillings' conceptual approach recognized the vital relationship between implementation research and practice. I have conducted a review of currently available training programs in implementation science to understand their scope and objectives and to assess whether any of these would be suitable benchmarks. Gillings used a design&#x2010;focused implementation framework to develop competencies from which were created four linked courses drawing from engineering, management, and the social sciences and emphasizing application through case studies. Course content was validated by mapping to published implementation science competencies.Results: To date, there is no other program that provides comprehensive interdisciplinary skills in applied implementation at the master&#x2019;s level. As of spring semester 2018, Gillings has offered a total of eleven sections of the four courses, attracting a total enrollment of 142, of whom 127 have been master's-level students in the school of public health. Using Kirkpatrick's Model, I found positive student reaction, learning, and behavior. Many students have completed applied implementation science&#x2010;focused practicums, master's papers, and special studies. Student interest in the courses is strong and growing. Conclusions: A systematic design approach can ensure that core interdisciplinary competencies of applied implementation science can be successfully incorporated into a MPH curriculum. Students find the training useful and have demonstrated the capability to master this material and incorporate it into their practicums and master's papers. Such training is increasingly essential to enable effective public health leadership in the twenty-first century.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The Effect of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol on Lung Resection Surgical Outcomes at the University of North Carolina Hospitals</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Introduction: The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary peri-operative care model that has been shown to reduce complications and hospital length of stay (LOS), improve cardiopulmonary function, and lead to earlier return of bowel function. While some thoracic ERAS studies have been inconclusive, others have shown that ERAS improves patient outcomes after lung resections and provides more cost- effective care. We aimed to investigate the effect of ERAS, in comparison to conventional care, on lung resection outcomes at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients undergoing lung resections (wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, and bilobectomy) during the pre-ERAS (April 2014- September 2015) and post-ERAS (January 2016-May 2017) periods were identified from the UNC thoracic surgery database. Resections performed during the wash-in period (October- December 2015) were excluded. Relevant demographic, pre-operative, anesthesia, and surgical variables were collected. Pre- and post-ERAS cohorts were compared in terms of hospital LOS, post-operative complications, 30-day readmission and mortality.Results: We identified 264 patients, half of which were exposed to ERAS. Pre- and post- ERAS groups were similar with respect to age, race, and comorbidities. There was no significant difference in hospital LOS, complications, or 30-day readmission between groups. There were only two cases of 30-day post-operative mortality in the post-ERAS group. Of the 163 patients in both groups who had hospital LOS greater than 3 days, 45 (28%) had pulmonary complications, half of which were prolonged air leaks for greater than 5 days.Conclusions: Median hospital LOS, complications, and 30-day readmission did not differ significantly between the pre- and post-ERAS groups. Thoracic ERAS protocols should include interventions to reduce air leak and consider discharging patients with chest tubes placed to a Heimlich valve. ERAS has been shown to improve patient satisfaction, and this warrants further studies.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has improved the life expectancy of adults living with HIV. As more people with HIV develop geriatric syndromes, new healthcare models may be necessary. This research aims to understand provider readiness to address the needs of older adults living with HIV and opinions about potential care models. Methods: I distributed a cross-sectional questionnaire using the North Carolina AIDS Training and Education Center listserve. This study analyzes data only from providers with a license to prescribe and who care for patients with HIV. The survey asked about (1) provider interest in additional help with certain geriatric conditions, (2) provider priorities regarding preventive medicine recommendations, and (3) provider opinions about potential care models. All data were self-reported. I conducted univariate and bivariate analyses using Stata SE 15.Results: Analysis included responses from 27 participants. All participants worked in North Carolina and saw older patients (age &#x2265; 50). Because the ability to prescribe was an inclusion criterion, physicians were the most common respondents. Participants were most interested in help with multiple comorbid conditions (Median: 85, IQR: 65-100), polypharmacy (at least 5 medications) (Median: 83, IQR: 51-100), cognitive impairment (Median: 80, IQR: 68.5-96), and mood disorders (Median: 80, IQR: 67-92). Respondents were most likely to rank screening for blood pressure (58%), diabetes (46%), and depression (46%) as the USPSTF recommendations they regarded as most important. The most recognized structural changes were developing formal guidelines (68%), creating regular training sessions in geriatric topics (60%), and adding allied health professionals for in-home or in-clinic assessments (60%).Discussion: Current infectious disease providers are already considering important geriatrics-specific interventions, but they also recognize a need for additional help in diagnosing and managing geriatric syndromes. Future efforts to address the aging HIV population should focus on developing formal guidelines, creating regular training sessions for infectious diseases providers, and considering the role of allied health care workers.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Objectives: Gender roles and cultural norms affect many aspects of women&#x2019;s life including their health. This study examines the association between women&#x2019;s autonomy over their health and their access to obstetric healthcare services in Egypt. The hypothesis is that women with positive autonomy indicators are more likely to use obstetric health services which include antenatal care, place of delivery, and postnatal care. Methods: The study included currently married women ages 15 to 49 years old from the 2014 Egypt Demographic Health Survey data. The analysis included bivariate regression and three multiple regression models for each service utilization indicator. Results: Multiple regression models showed that autonomy indicators retained some of their significance even after adjusting for age, education, work, residency, wealth, and birth order. Conclusions: A woman&#x2019;s autonomy over her health affects her access to obstetric health service.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>AbstractBackground: In response to increasing healthcare costs in the United States, the Institute for HealthcareImprovement released the triple aim goals to inspire the creation of programs that would improve quality of care, overall health, and reduce costs simultaneously. Care-management programs are one such initiative that many sites are using to address patient needs. More recently, student-led care management initiatives have been introduced; however, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of these programs for improving patient outcomes.Objective: The Duke Hot Spotting Initiative (DHSI) is a student-led program started in 2015 aimed at addressing health disparities and high health care costs through a relationship-based care management model. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the effect of the DHSI initiative on specific patient health and utilization outcomes.Methods: This is retrospective review of the past three phases of the DHSI program in Durham, North Carolina. Eligible DHSI patients were those enrolled in preexisting care-management programs at Duke Outpatient Clinic. Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood pressure readings were compared from the end of the 6-month pre-intervention period to the end of the 6-month intervention period and use as surrogates for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension respectively. Emergency department (ED) utilization rates and no-show rates were also compared over this time period.Findings: Twenty-nine participants were included in this analysis. Mean hemoglobin A1c values decreased from 9.0 to 8.3 (p = 0.249) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 142 to 137 mmHg (p = 0.494) ED utilization rates decreased by 20% (p = 0.970) while no-show rates increased by 20% (p = 0.239).Conclusions: These results demonstrate that student-led navigation under the supervision of a care manager has had a non-statistical yet clinically significant improvement in measures of HbA1c, SBP, and ED utilization rates. The enrollment of patients from previous care-management programs may diminish the full benefit that students have on patient outcomes. This analysis shows that such a model of care- management led by students is a promising strategy. Future studies could measure outcomes in a larger patient sample and also assess qualitative outcomes such as well-being and achievement of patient- specific health goals.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Outcomes among Octogenarians and Nonagenarians in a Contemporary Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Do Not Differ Based on Age Alone</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: Cardiac Intensive Care Units (CICUs) are understudied, yet are facing a growing demand for resources and an aging, increasingly complex patient population. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of a very elderly (age &#x2265;80 years) CICU population in the United States has never before been described relative to a younger population. A better understanding of this patient population could improve the quality of care for patients of all ages with critical cardiovascular illness.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively-collected database of consecutive CICU patients admitted to our institution. This included 670 patients from Dec 2012 to Mar 2014 who were then stratified into 2 groups based upon age: &amp;lt;80 and &#x2265;80 years. Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected, along with resource use. Multiple regression was used to analyze length of stay and mortality during the CICU stay and index hospital admission.Results: There were significantly more Caucasians in the very elderly cohort (75% vs. 54%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and rates of interventions were generally similar by age. Very elderly patients were significantly less likely to be discharged to home (63% vs 85%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Despite significantly higher illness severity scores among patients aged 80 and older, there were no significant adjusted age-based differences in length of stay nor morbidity. Conclusion: We found that very elderly CICU patients did not differ significantly in terms of cardiovascular risk profile, resource utilization, or short-term mortality, compared to a younger cohort of CICU patients. Our findings indicate that age over 80 years alone should not be a determining factor when predicting outcomes or making triage and treatment decisions in this population. However, our findings need to be replicated beyond a single center to make confident conclusions about the wider American CICU population.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Importance: Female adolescents and young adults in the United States have high rates of unintended pregnancy and STI acquisition. Objective: Determine whether female adolescents and young adults who use long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are less likely to use a hormonal contraceptive or copper IUD concurrently with a condom, also known as dual method use. As a result, they have a higher sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence than those who use other short acting reversible contraceptives (SARCs).Data Source: Searches of PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant studies published from January 1, 1988 through April 5, 2018.Study Selection: English-language studies conducted in female adolescent and/or young adults comparing rates of dual method use and/or STI incidence between LARC and SARC users.   Data Extraction and Syntheses: One investigator reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. Studies were unable to be pooled given the degree of clinical and methodological heterogeneity.Main Outcome and Measures: Dual method use and STI incidence.Results: The review included 5 studies &#x2013; 4 prospective cohort studies and 1 cluster randomized trial. Strength of evidence for both outcomes was low given high risk of bias, lack of power, and indirectness of evidence. A large cohort study (N=1048) with moderate risk of bias and a small cohort study (N=399) with critical risk of bias found decreased dual method use among LARC users (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83; RR 0.48 95% CI 0.28 to 0.82, respectively). A cluster randomized trial (N=1500) with low risk of bias and a small cohort study (N=210) with critical risk of bias found no significant difference in dual method use (RR 0.98 95% CI 0.75 to 1.29; RR 0.99 95% CI 0.78 to 1.26, respectively). There was no difference in STI incidence between female adolescent and young adult users of LARCs and SARCs.  Conclusion: More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen the body of literature on the relationship of LARC uptake on dual method use and STI acquisition. Providers should continue to emphasize the need for both protection against pregnancy and STIs in adolescent and young women seeking contraception.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: As standard practice, labor and delivery providers determine blood loss after a vaginal delivery via subjective visual estimation. This method is known to be inaccurate, which can delay the diagnosis and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. To combat this, several patient safety and quality care groups have recommended the quantification of cumulative blood loss for every vaginal delivery as part of a comprehensive maternal hemorrhage protocol. University of North Carolina Hospitals in Chapel Hill, NC has discussed a pilot for a new quantification of blood loss (QBL) strategy as part of an updated obstetric hemorrhage protocol. At the time of this writing, they have yet to incorporate QBL into clinical practice in the labor and delivery unit. Objectives: To gather input from key stakeholders within the labor and delivery unit to determine the feasibility and likelihood of adopting a quantification of blood loss strategy as standard practice for vaginal deliveries at UNC Hospitals. Also, to identify the barriers of and facilitators to implementing such a protocol at UNC. Methods: I conducted 7 key stakeholder interviews with individuals who play key roles in the delivery of obstetric care at UNC Hospitals. Respondents included staff nurses, resident physicians, faculty/attending physicians, and health care leadership, all of whom contribute to clinical care in the labor and delivery unit. I then analyzed transcripts of each interview to find common themes within the participants&#x2019; answers.Findings: Five out of 6 (83.33%) stakeholders had negative views of visual estimation (VEBL) as standard practice for determining blood loss after a vaginal delivery. Only 2/7 (28.57%) believed that VEBL was sufficient for patient care. Not one stakeholder (0/7) thought VEBL was easy for providers. All providers (5/5) responding to a question about current QBL use reported infrequent quantification of blood loss in UNC&#x2019;s labor and delivery. Some barriers to implementation of routine QBL reported by stakeholders included time and education of providers on new techniques. Four providers were knowledgeable about a proposed update to the UNC OB hemorrhage protocol that would include routine QBL as a new guideline.  Conclusion: Leaders have convened an OB hemorrhage task force that is currently working to introduce an update to the UNC obstetric hemorrhage protocol. Changes to the clinical guidance include a strategy for QBL with routine use of calibrated collector bags and gravimetric measurement for high-risk blood loss. The stakeholder interviews show positive attitudes towards implementing change, so long as it is evidence-based and beneficial to the patients. Given buy-in from proper parties, a transition to routine QBL is likely feasible at UNC Hospitals&#x2019; labor and delivery unit.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Objective: To determine the association between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and luteal phase deficiency.Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective time-to-conceive cohort study performed at the University of North Carolina. Women aged 30-44 years without a history of infertility completed daily menstrual diaries. Exposures of interest included early follicular phase serum levels of antim&#xFC;llerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and estradiol (serum samples collected at enrollment). The primary outcome was luteal phase deficiency as defined by luteal bleeding (&#x2265; 1 day of spotting) or a short luteal phase length (&#x2264; 11 days). Covariates of interest included age, race, previous miscarriages, previous pregnancies, and hormonal contraception use.  GEE models were used to estimate the association between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and luteal phase deficiency.Results: Overall, 755 women provided information on 2,171 menstrual cycles and serum for measurement of at least one biomarker of ovarian reserve. There were 2,096 cycles from 754 women in the luteal phase bleeding cohort, of which 40% experienced luteal phase bleeding. After adjusting for age, race, previous miscarriages, and previous pregnancies, diminished ovarian reserve was not statistically significantly associated with luteal phase bleeding. Low early follicular phase FSH levels increased the odds of luteal phase bleeding (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.25, 2.71), as did high early follicular phase estradiol levels (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.26, 2.01). A total of 608 cycles from 286 women were in the luteal phase length cohort, of which 13% had a short luteal phase. After adjusting for age, there was no statistically significant association between diminished ovarian reserve and a short luteal phase. The risk of a short luteal phase decreased with increasing inhibin B (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45, 0.81). Conclusions: Diminished ovarian reserve is not associated with luteal phase deficiency, as defined by luteal phase bleeding or a short luteal phase, in women of older reproductive age.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A descriptive analysis of the effects of widespread armed conflict on antibiotic resistance rates</dc:title>

          <dc:description>This paper posits a theoretical framework by which armed conflict may selectively pressure bacterial to become more resistant and identifies measurements by which to longitudinally measure the level of conflict and resultant state fragility within nations. The primary aims of this work were to determine (1) whether there is sufficient literature to examine whether the introduction and propagation of statewide conflict and resultant government fragility correlates with the rate of antibiotic resistance within a country, (2) whether such a correlation exists, and (3) whether measurements of state peace or stability are predictive measures of resistance patterns. A secondary aim of this paper was to present the current state of the research regarding antibiotic resistant rates in countries afflicted by large-scale conflict. Using the Global Peace Index (GPI) and Fragile State Index (FSI), Libya, Mali, and Syria were identified as the optimal contexts with which to test the hypothesis. Because no national data were reported for any of the states during the study period (2007-2017), all data used in this analysis were identified through a systematic review of the literature. Data from each country were visualized in three ways: by study year and pathogen classification, by bacterial-antibiotic or antibiotic class pairings highlighted in the WHO&#x2019;s 2014 Report &#x201C;Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance&#x201D;, and by resistance to antibiotics in the Reserve Group of the WHO&#x2019;s List of Essential Medications. Unfortunately, the data available in the published literature were of poor amount, quality, substance, and detail both prior to and following the outbreak of conflict. It was thus not possible to thoroughly examine the effect, if any, of conflict on resistance or the predictive value of measurements of peace and state fragility. Concerning rates of resistance were identified with multiple antibiotics, including many listed in the Reserve Group by the WHO. Perhaps most alarmingly, there were multiple antibiotics in the Reserve Group and otherwise with no data on resistance. More research in this area is needed.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>In the literature about Russian LGBTQ communities, an examination of how LGBTQ-identifying foreigners &#x2014; particularly Americans &#x2014; navigate the unique relationship between Russia and the LGBTQ community is missing. The goal of this qualitative study was to better understand how this population made planned for their time in Russia, found LGBTQ-friendly spaces, and made decisions about &#x201C;coming out.&#x201D; The participants in this study used their general knowledge in Slavic studies &#x2014; rather than directed, active information-seeking to form assumptions and plans about how they would present and &#x201C;come out&#x201D; in Russia. Many times, this meant they planned to remain &#x201C;in the closet&#x201D;; however, sometimes &#x2014; through cultural clues &#x2014; they could make an educated guess about whether or not coming out to a particular person would be a threat to their physical safety. Finally, participants who made interpersonal connections reported a higher success rate with finding LGBT-friendly spaces, such as gay bars.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Academic archives and special collections are acquiring a growing number of collections that contained mixed-format, mixed-material, or mixed-media items. This paper seeks to understand both how and why academic archives are processing, arranging, and describing audiovisual materials within these mixed-materials collections. Through interviews with nine archivists at large, academic archives and an examination of both existing finding aids and processing manuals, this research examines the disparity between theory and practice of the processing of mixed-material collections and the subsequent discovery of the audiovisual material by users of online finding aids.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Importance Food assistance programs have been associated with obesity in adults. However, the association between Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and childhood obesity (CO) is unclear. Understanding how SNAP may be associated with CO is essential for population health, as CO is associated with short and long-term morbidity and mortality. Objective Systematically review the evidence on SNAP use and association with CO in the U.S.Data Sources: PUBMED, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov (to April 2018).  Study Selection This review included English cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses conducted in the US. Data Extraction &amp; Synthesis Investigator reviewed abstracts, full-text articles, and risk of bias. Main outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was childhood overweight and obesity, assessed with BMI percentiles based on CDC definition. No secondary outcomes were assessed. Results 121 studies were screened, and 13 (29,856 participants) were included. Most studies controlled for child&#x2019;s age, gender, race/ethnicity, and family income. Six studies reported that SNAP participation was associated with BMI and CO, with two studies showing an association with increased BMI and/or likelihood of CO, three showing an association with decreased BMI or likelihood of CO, and one study showing both (Subgroup analysis found positive relationship in cities with high-food prices and negative relationship in those with low prices). Seven studies reported no overall association. Limitations Incomplete reporting of data limited evaluation of evidence. Conclusions and Relevance There is inconsistent evidence about the association between use of SNAP and CO. While results of this systematic review were mixed, it is unlikely that SNAP participation is associated with increased BMI, or increased rates or probability of CO in the U.S.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>BACKGROUND: Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is a progressive neurodegenerative optic neuropathy. Its progression is monitored by documenting morphological changes to the optic nerve head, inner retinal layers, and quantifying the visual field over time. Visual field testing is done using table-top instruments that cannot be used for home self monitoring and are not practical forpopulation-based screening. A tablet-based application, Melbourne Rapid Fields (MRF), was developed recently on the iPad platform to facilitate visual field testing outside the traditional clinical setting, but has not been tested in low-income nations.OBJECTIVE: To test usability of the MRF in a low-resource setting, to compare its results, and to assess the correlation and agreement with those of the Humphrey Field Analyzer 24-2 SITA standard (HFA), considered as clinical standard for testing visual field.METHODS: Thirty-two subjects with and those without glaucoma attending their clinical appointment at the UNC Kittner Eye Center (n= 13) and Tema Eye Center in Ghana (n= 19) were recruited between June and July 2018. All participants underwent visual fieldtesting with the MRF and HFA. They were then administered an Ease of Use Questionnaire to determine perceptions of the new MRF testing. Global (mean deviation, MD; pattern standard deviation, PSD), reliability indices (false positive rate, FPR; false negative rate, FNR; and fixation loss) and testing duration of the two methods were compared. The results were also assessed for correlation and agreement.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in the final analysis, 11 from UNC Kittner Eye Center (age: 68 &#xB1; 8 years old, range: 49-76) and 18 from Tema Eye Center (age: 42 &#xB1; 12 years old, range: 18-62). Overall, 48% of participants had glaucoma and 52% were healthy patients. MRF MD was significantly higher than HFA MD at UNC (&amp;lt; 0.01); no difference in MD was observed between the two devices in Tema (p = 0.89). PFR and FNR were comparable between the two methods at both study sites (all p &gt; 0.05). MD and PSD from the two devices were strongly (r = 0.71, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and moderately (r = 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated, respectively. Agreement analysis revealed that MRF tended to generate significantly higher MD (bias: 1.8 &#xB1; 0.41 dB, p = 0.03) and PSD (bias: 1.5 dB &#xB1; 0.34 dB; p = 0.03) with wide limits of agreements. Subgroup analysis comparing MRF and HFA results in Ghana and UNC separately demonstrated similar mean MD in TEMA (p=0.89), but significantly different at UNC (p&amp;lt;0.01). The MRF was well-tolerated by patients at all sites.CONCLUSIONS: Although, the MRF and HFA global indices correlated strongly for MD and moderately for PSD, the agreement analysis indicated that MRF tended to underestimate MD and PSD values than HFA. In both agreement analysis, the mean differences were significant, suggesting a poor agreement between the two devices. Further studies should investigate this discrepancy and refine the MRF application to maximize results. However, MRF shows great potential for use in a low-income setting.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: The United States has a high unintended pregnancy rate. Many public health and health care efforts attempt to increase contraceptive access for U.S. women to prevent unintended pregnancy. However, many barriers to contraceptive access exist. A systematic review was performed to examine published literature about contraceptive barriers for underserved, reproductive-age women in the United States. The objective of this study is to build upon published literature to examine barriers to contraception for women specifically in North Carolina.Methods: I identified contraception providers using the NC Medical Board&#x2019;s list of practicing OBGYN physicians. I contacted providers by telephone and performed telephone interviews about contraception barriers, according to an interview guide. I transcribed and performed thematic analysis of survey data to identify contraceptive barriers. Results: I contacted 35 providers and 3 providers participated (response rate 8.6%), including 2 OBYGN physicians and 1 nurse practitioner. Thematic analysis identified an array of barriers to contraception, including patient financial and logistical barriers (financial cost to patients, insurance status, type of insurance, transportation, language), health system and structural barriers (reimbursement policies, insurance authorization, requirement of multiple clinic visits for IUD/implant insertion, administrative demands on patients and practices, and schedule of health care appointments/services and time constraints), knowledge gap barriers (patient misconceptions and misinformation, provider knowledge/comfort), culture and ideology barriers (patient cultural/religious beliefs, family/friend influence, partner influence, relationship between provider/educator and patient, patient age, personal competing demands), and medical barriers (contraceptive side effects, medical comorbidities).Discussion: Based on provider perspective, there are many barriers to contraception access for women in North Carolina. Examination of barriers and gaps in contraceptive access provides insight for North Carolina women&#x2019;s health initiatives and health care policy.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>A Model for Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Prehospital ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients: A Systematic Review</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Acute myocardial infarction is treated regularly with emergency coronary intervention, but this treatment comes with the risk of reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a treatment that has the potential to reduce the impact of reperfusion injury, but it is unclear what effect it has on patients diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when used before cardiac intervention. This systematic review was performed to identify and evaluate studies that assess whether RIC improves mortality, reduces myocardial injury, and leads to better clinical outcomes when used in patients at risk for reperfusion injury. Searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov through April 2018 for clinical trials comparing RIC and standard care before patients with STEMI receive ether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic intervention. Outcomes considered in this review include all-cause mortality, infarct size, ST-segment resolution, cardiac biomarker trends, left ventricular ejection fraction, and myocardial salvage index. One investigator selected qualifying trials, extracted data, and assessed the strength of evidence.Eleven studies (2,981 participants) were included in this review and most were found to demonstrate a low risk of bias. Evidence was found to be of moderate strength for four outcomes (all-cause mortality, infarct size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and myocardial salvage index), low strength for one outcome (ST-segment resolution), and very low strength for one outcome (cardiac biomarker trends). All-cause mortality was the only outcome for which the evidence showed no difference between RIC and standard care. Significant decreases in infarct size, when measured directly through imaging, was moderate, ranging from 2% to 6.5%, but varied widely when infarct size was measured using ST-segment resolution and cardiac biomarker trends as proxies. Myocardial salvage index was consistently shown to be improved in RIC patients but varied in magnitude from 8.7% to 50% higher median index scores. Most studies found higher left ventricular ejection fractions with magnitudes ranging from 2.6% to 10%. The evidence synthesized here shows that RIC improves intermediate cardiac outcomes but has not been shown to improve all-cause mortality.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Effect of Respiratory Viral Panel Testing on Antibiotic Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in Adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies.</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background: Antibiotic stewardship efforts often support the use of viral diagnostics to distinguish viral from bacterial in respiratory infections. However, the utility of respiratory viral panels to identify a broad spectrum of viral pathogens and reduce unnecessary antibiotic consumption is unclear. This review systematically examined studies of these molecular diagnostics to evaluate the current evidence for their use in stewardship efforts.Methods: I conducted a search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClincalTrials.gov. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies that examined the effect of respiratory viral panels (concurrently examining &gt;3 viral pathogens) for adults on changes in antibiotic prescribing habits, antimicrobial resistance patterns, or economic outcomes.Results: I included eight studies, six randomized controlled trials and two prospective cohort studies. Studies were mostly low to moderate quality. Four studies showed some small changes in antibiotic use, but effects were inconsistent and not sustained. Four studies failed to show any reductions in inappropriate antibiotic utilization at all. No studies reported data on changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns and only two reported cost data.Conclusions: Insufficient evidence exists to recommend respiratory viral panel testing as a tool to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure and combat antimicrobial resistance. A large multi-center randomized controlled trial with blinding and concurrent cost and resistance analysis would be required. However, future stewardship research efforts should focus on the decision-making inputs providers use and study diagnostics that more closely match these inputs.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Background: People with HIV (PWHIV) have improved survival due to the advent of antiretroviral therapy. Consequently, PWHIV experience higher rates of many non-AIDS defining malignancies (NADM). Previous studies have shown worsened cancer-specific survival in PWHIV, partly due to advanced cancer stage at diagnosis. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate screening disparities for NADM among PWHIV.Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1996 through April 10, 2018 to identify any study related to screening disparities for NADM in PWHIV. Eligibility criteria included any study performed in a high-income country that compared screening for NADM by HIV status. After review of titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality, results were included studies were synthesized.Results: Of 697 articles identified through searches, 9 studies met full inclusion criteria; 3 addressed breast cancer screening, 4 addressed colorectal cancer screening, and 2 addressed prostate cancer screening. Five studies demonstrated that PWHIV were less likely to receive indicated cancer screenings compared with the general population while 3 showed that screening proportions were higher in PWHIV; 1 showed that screening proportions were comparable. In a majority of the studies, PWHIV with regular access to healthcare were more likely to undergo cancer screening. The studies also demonstrated that patients with poor insurance status, access to healthcare, education, income-level were less likely to receive cancer screening.Conclusions: The available evidence does not uniformly confirm that PWHIV are less likely to receive cancer screening. Social determinants of health were associated with receipt of appropriate cancer screening, suggesting that these barriers need to be addressed to improve cancer screening in PWHIV.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Are Race Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Similar Across Socioeconomic Strata? A Systematic Review</dc:title>

          <dc:description>PURPOSE: Racial differences in CVD risk factors are well documented. Socioeconomic determinants of health have been used as an explanation for the differences in CVD outcomes between African Americans and Caucasians, however the interaction of socioeconomic factors and race is not well understood. To further explore this relationship, this review aimed to assess whether racial disparities in CVD risk among African-Americans and Caucasians differ based on their socioeconomic status.METHODS: Systematic review of the literature was conducted with the main MeSH terms &#x201C;race&#x201D;, &#x201C;socioeconomic status&#x201D;, &#x201C;cardiovascular disease&#x201D;, &#x201C;risk&#x201D; and &#x201C;adult&#x201D;. Results were reviewed for eligibility per PECOTS criteria which where formulated to answer the key question. Risk factors were compared across racial categories. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively, in tabular and narrative format.RESULTS: Four studies were included. Three of the studies were conducted in the United States, and they examined how the relationship between SES and race influenced CVD risk in African-Americans when compared to Caucasians. Four studies found that African Americans were at higher odds of several CVD risk factors, including hypertension (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.72 &#x2013; 2.09). African-Americans had greater odds of multiple CVD risk factors across varying socioeconomic strata. Two studies found that racial differences in health were more pronounced at higher levels of socioeconomic status than at the lowest levels for some CVD risk factors. Compared to Caucasians, African-Americans earning $100,000 or more are more likely to experience greater racial disparity in obesity (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.91 &#x2013; 3.09) than African-Americans earning less than $35,000 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.24 &#x2013; 1.69).CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the effect of socioeconomic status on CVD risk among African Americans and Caucasians. African-Americans generally have greater prevalence of CVD risk factors than Caucasians in similar socioeconomic strata. Some groups of African-Americans experienced higher CVD risk with increasing socioeconomic status. The results suggest that African-Americans experience fewer CVD-related benefits from increasing levels of educational attainment and income than do their Caucasian counterparts.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Association Between Medical Financial Burden and Subsequent Health Care Utilization</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Medical financial burden has been linked to unfavorable lifestyle changes, diminished access to care, poor psychological well-being, and greater morbidity and mortality. The association between medical financial burden and subsequent health care utilization is still unclear but has implications for affected patients and the health care system.Methods: Among adults in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Panel 19, the associations between medical financial burden in 2014 and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, medical office visits, and prescription drug usage in 2015, were assessed. Analyses accounted for complex survey design and incorporated regression models to adjust for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics as well as previous year utilization.Results: Based on a sample of 9,561 participants, an estimated 23.5% (95% CI 21.8% to 25.4%) of US adults experienced medical financial burden, which occurred more frequently among those with lower education and income levels, psychological distress, and higher numbers of chronic medical conditions. After adjusting for baseline characteristics and previous year utilization, significantly higher proportions of adults with medical financial burden, compared to the proportion of those without, visited the emergency department (17.2% vs 13.6%, p=0.002) and were hospitalized (9.8% vs 6.9%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Those with medical financial burden also filled more prescription medications (17.51 vs 16.18, p=0.048) but had similar numbers of medical office visits (7.21 vs 7.24, p=0.930), compared to those without the issue. Conclusion: Medical financial burden is associated with increased subsequent health care utilization, which may exert additional financial strain on affected patients and stress capacity constraints in the emergency department system. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for this association and if the increase in health care utilization is preventable.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Low parent health literacy is associated with poor child health outcomes and preventive care behaviors. The relationship between health literacy and childhood immunization status is under-explored. The objective of this retrospective study was to examine the relationship between caregiver health literacy and childhood immunization status in a cohort of children enrolled in the Greenlight study. The association of caregiver health literacy, as measured by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy, with childhood immunization status at 24 months of age was modeled using logistic regression, controlling for common covariates of underimmunization in early childhood. After accounting for lost to follow-up, health literacy was not associated with a combined 6-vaccine series (aOR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.57, 2.30) nor with receipt of 2 doses seasonal influenza immunization at 24 months of age (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI 0.80, 3.11). Given the study&#x2019;s limitations, more rigorous study is needed to provide more conclusive evidence about the relationship between health literacy and childhood immunization uptake, including to specific vaccinations like seasonal influenza.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: It is known that there is an association between higher body mass index (BMI) and lower extremity osteoarthritis (OA), but the presence of this degenerative disease in the shoulder remains relatively unknown. Adipokines, cytokines at increased concentrations in higher body mass index (BMI) individuals play a role in cartilage degeneration providing a plausible link between BMI and glenohumeral OA. We examined the association between BMI and the prevalence of glenohumeral OA and arthroplasty.Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared 596,874 age and gender matched patients across six BMI cohorts from a private payer database (Humana). The prevalence of glenohumeral OA was determined in each cohort, as was the standardized arthroplasty rates. Odds ratios were calculated for both OA and standardized arthroplasty rates by comparing thereference cohort, BMI &amp;lt; 19, cohort to the other five BMI cohorts.Results: Individuals in the five cohorts above the BMI &amp;lt; 19 level were all at increased odds of developing glenohumeral OA compared to those in the BMI &amp;lt; 19 cohort (OR range: 1.21 &#x2013;1.92). Those in the three cohorts above BMI 30 were also at increased odds of undergoing arthroplasty (OR range: 1.19 &#x2013; 1.52) compared with the reference standard. Conclusions: Patients with higher BMI are at increased odds of developing glenohumeral OA, despite the conventional belief that such an association is limited to hip and knee joints. Additionally, the previously unreported finding of an increased rate of arthroplasty performed on obese patients represents a novel source of a disproportionately high surgical burden among thissegment of the population.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Introduction: Millions of Americans depend on a loosely organized and variable safety net health care institutions and providers, which is described as fragile, strained for resources, and vulnerable to shifting social, political, and economic forces. A call to action has been made by many to increase and improve efforts to monitor the structure, capacity, and stability of the safety net. Efforts to do so have been short lived, fragmented, and inconsistent. This task falls within the responsibilities of public health agencies.Objective: This scoping review aims to identify focused assessments of health care safety net capacity in order to inventory and qualitatively map the indicators and metrics used to assess capacity, and the methodologies or primary sources used to obtain relevant data. Its findings inform recommendations for public health officials, researchers and other stakeholders interested in assessing safety net capacity, or furthering research on this topic.Methods: A search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted to identify English-language articles published between 2000 and 2018. Digital Commons and select government websites were searched to identify relevant unpublished literature. Eligible studies included descriptive reports and focused inquiries assessing the safety net including its capacity; and cohort, cross-sectional, and before-after studies that assessed measures of capacity as independent or dependent variables. Data was extracted from the selected articles to include the indicators used to assess capacity, the metrics used, and the data collection methodologies. The indicators used in the selected studies were grouped into categories to produce a consistent nomenclature, and a potential framework for future assessments of capacity.iiResults: Thirty-one articles were included. Three were comprehensive assessments of community safety nets; the rest were focused on specific facilities, providers, or services within the safety net. Indicators of capacity used were grouped into 12 categories: Workforce, Infrastructure, Range of Services, Specialist Availability, Primary Care Availability, Medicaid Participation and Indigent Care, Health Information Technology Capacity, Enabling Services, Organizational Capacity, Sentinel Events, Disaster Preparedness, and General Capacity. A wide range of metrics were used to assess these indicators. Both primary and secondary data were frequently used, but they were infrequently used in conjunction. Surveys, key informant interviews, and site visits were the most frequently used strategies for collecting primary data. The Uniform Data System, Medicare/Medicaid claims data, administrative data, and the AMA Masterfile were the most frequently used sources of secondary data.Discussion and Conclusion: Efforts to monitor the safety net continue to be urgently needed. Examples of safety net capacity assessments are limited in number and scope, and are often difficult to locate. This report proposes recommendations for public health organizations, policy makers, and academics to better enable safety net capacity assessment and research through increased investment, improved data collection and reporting guidelines, inclusion of focused safety net assessment in Community Health Assessments, and the development of a national repository of similar documents.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Systematic Review of the Health Benefits of Vegetarian and Vegan Diets in the Management of Adults with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Introduction:  The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly increasing and recent estimates rank type 2 DM as the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. Although some evidence suggests that consuming a vegetarian diet may lead to better glycemic control and improved metabolic outcomes compared with a conventional hypocaloric diet among persons with type 2 DM, there is uncertainty regarding the magnitude of benefit and the specific outcomes that show benefit.  Medical costs associated with diabetes, overweight, heart disease, lipid disorders and hypertension are a significant cost to the healthcare system and employers.  The need for reductions in these illnesses is driven by both medical and economic concerns and requires a targeted approach in both the patient-care and workplace settings.Objective: To conduct a systematic review of clinical trials evaluating the benefit of vegan and vegetarian diets for improving glycemic control and other metabolic outcomes in type 2 DMMethods:  Data source: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and the Clinical Trails databases were searched for trials published in the English language in the last ten years through April 4, 2018. The following criteria were used for study inclusion: (1) studies enrolling adults (18 years or older); (2) vegan or vegetarian diet as the intervention; and (3) participants had a previous diagnosis of type 2 DM.  Main outcome measures were HbA1c, body weight and LDL levels. Critical appraisal and abstraction of relevant data from studies was performed by one author. Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria (785 total participants, mean age 53 years).  Vegan and vegetarian diets were shown to be associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c, body weight, and LDL levels.  Consumption of a vegan or vegetarian diet yielded a decrease in HbA1c  of -0.40% to -0.65% in the intervention arm of the four best studies.   These same studies had an HbA1c change in the control arm of -0.08% to 0.21%.   The difference between intervention and control groups mean change in HbA1c was reported with statistical significance in five studies with a range of -1.5% to -0.7 %.  In the three of the studies reporting on BMI, differences between groups in mean changes from baseline were all statistically significant and ranged from  -1.0 kg/m2 to -3.9 kg/m2.   In four of the studies reporting on weight change, differences between groups in mean changes from baseline were all statistically significant and ranged from -2.8 kg to -10.6 kg.  In four of the studies reporting on LDL, differences between groups in mean changes from baseline were all statistically significant and ranged from -7.2 mg/dL to -0.54 mg/dL.Conclusion:   This systematic review supports the evidence from clinical trials that vegan and vegetarian diets reduce HbA1c levels and results in weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.  The health benefits of introducing a vegan or vegetarian diet program, at home or in a corporate setting, can lead to improving the management of type 2 DM in adults, and reducing morbidity and mortality of type 2 DM.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Model for &#x201C;Positive Gentrification&#x201D; Without Displacement</dc:title>

          <dc:description>By critically evaluating the &#x2018;double-edged sword&#x2019; (potential positive and negative impacts) of the controversial issue of gentrification, this paper provides insight and practical guidance for other communities regarding methods and tools to creatively and collaboratively address one of the many problems that public health faces. These multifactorial adaptive issues must be addressed in order for Public Health to fulfill its mission of &#x201C;assuring the conditions in which people can be healthy&#x201D; and happy, its vision of &#x201C;&#x2019;healthy people, together in healthy communities,&#x2019; and fulfill its primary ethical mandate, that is to be personally and professionally &#x2018;responsible&#x2019; for the health of her community.&#x201D;The paper progresses as follows:First, I define the issue of positive and negative &#x201C;gentrification&#x201D; from a Public Health perspective, emphasizing the critical sub-issue of displacement and the inherent opportunity for both harm and health.Second, using this definition of gentrification, I outline the relevant literature- emphasizing and comparing and contrasting communities&#x2019; experiences- and provide a critical review of the implications of their findings.Third, based on the implications of gentrification on Public Health, share the conceptualization, and development of a model for addressing this wicked issue. A pilot study to determine the in-vivo, real-world application of the model in the city of Durham, NC is proposed and outlined.Finally, a brief discussion of the city-specific modifications to the processes and tools in the base model that may be necessary is discussed.The paper emphasizes relationships, politics, and leadership throughout. From inception to completion, leadership- and in particular, objective, inclusive, bridge-building and change management leadership- will be key. The proposed model for gentrification, along with how this topic is related to public health, is delineated. This model could be used in a variety of contexts and with a public health lens, could be used for improving the social determinants of health and the impact of the life course model so that equivalent opportunities are presented to community members to then make their own choices based on common community assets. This approach is guided by Public Health values and goals, the Public Health Code of Ethics, the Healthy People Year 2020 Health Objectives for the Nation, Health in all Policies, A Culture of Health, and ultimately Collective Impact and healthy communities.This paper grows the important evidence-based thought and action process around the social determinants/contributors to health and argues that the available research on gentrification justifies the addition of this topic to the constellation of &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; issues that require a public health systems approach for amelioration.Furthermore, a practical starting point and initial steps regarding how to address the impact of gentrification in Durham from a public health perspective are offered. This includes creating a concept of positive gentrification, detailing what leadership roles must be fulfilled in order to achieve positive gentrification, and finally recommendations for, North Carolina as a pilot initiative. Durham has recently undergone the gentrification process and has the capacity to achieve positive health outcomes. This paper is intended to provide ideal steps for any city, but particularly for Durham to consider in order to proactively and creatively address all areas of concern and take advantage of all opportunities that the gentrification process will intrinsically and inevitably present.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>As part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) Three Zero Environmental Initiative, the University proposes to convert an existing underground detention facility at Baity Hill at Mason Farm Student Housing Complex into a rainwater cistern. The property is currently irrigated using metered potable water from the water main running parallel with Mason Farm Road. The University would like to use the detention facility as the primary water source for irrigation. A hydrologic analysis has been conducted to determine how much runoff is reaching the existing underground detention facility.  Using ten years&#x2019; worth of irrigation demand data provided by UNC-CH and North Carolina State University Biological &amp; Agricultural Engineering&#x2019;s (NCSU-BAE) Rainwater Harvester tool, 75% (+/- 7%) of the annual irrigation demand could be met by the rainwater cistern. Two options for a secondary source for irrigation were considered: the existing potable water line and an abandoned non-potable reclaimed water line that would need to be extended to the property. The net present value cost to irrigate the property over 15 years could decrease roughly 40% compared to current operations.This report discusses the feasibility of converting the underground detention facility into a rainwater cistern and available options for secondary sources. Detailed descriptions of the project site, the overarching objectives of the Three Zeros Initiative behind this proposal. pertinent calculations, details, and cost-benefit analyses can be found in the sections, tables, and appendices to follow.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>ystematic Review: Influenza Infections/Vaccinations and the Risk of Developing Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease</dc:title>

          <dc:description>Background:Since Glenner and Wong&#x2019;s amyloid hypothesis, in which accumulations of amyloid proteins cause Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease (AD), was first proposed in 1984, the questions about why amyloid proteins accumulate in the first place remain. One hypothesis, known as the infection/infectious hypothesis, postulates that bacterial, viral, or fungal infections in the brain cause chronic inflammation which results in accumulation of amyloid proteins. Although the association between HSV-1 and AD has been extensively studied, evidence of association between AD and other pathogens remains inconclusive. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the literature examining the association between influenza virus/vaccine and AD. Methods:The authors searched four databases (PUBMED, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and EBSCO) to find articles that examined association between influenza virus/vaccine and AD. Two reviewers examined each article for its adherence to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the third reviewer settled any ties. The quality of included studies was assessed using guidelines developed by The Duke Evidence-based Practice Center, based on guidance from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).Results:Three studies met full eligibility criteria; none showed a statistically significant association between influenza infection/vaccine and the risk of AD. Studies assessed heterogeneous exposures. One (N=3865) showed a non-statistically significant reduction in AD risk in subjects who received influenza vaccine. The second (N=19463) did not show any association between previous influenza infection and the risk of AD. The third found no association between in utero influenza exposure and the risk of AD.Conclusions:The three included studies did not find any association between influenza infection/vaccine and the risk of AD. However, studies were heterogeneous in terms of population, exposure and outcome measurements, which limits the ability to make a conclusion. There remains a lack of large robust studies that study this association. Therefore, future studies that examine this relationship should include prospective design with large cohorts and use exposure and outcome measurements that minimize bias.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Many people who were previously incarcerated or gang-involved often have visible and offensive tattoos which can eventually be regretted due to personal, social, or professional reasons. Despite changes to personal beliefs and desires to stay away from a prior life of crime or deviance, tattoos persist as a constant reminder of the past and hinder remediation efforts. Laser surgery is the mainstay of tattoo removal, but expense usually proves too high a barrier to widespread use. In order to address the specific needs of this population, tattoo removal programs offer a means to eliminate financial barriers by providing the service at reduced or no cost. No programs of this sort currently exist in what is known as the Triangle of North Carolina (anchored by the town of Chapel Hill and the cities of Raleigh and Durham). Thus, a novel tattoo removal program, Square One, is in development as a method to address unmet community needs. The goals of Square One are to help those trying to start on a new life path. Square One aims to help keep individuals away from criminal behavior and social marginalization by removing outward marks of a past life. In doing so, Square One may be a valuable tool to reduce recidivism, improve reintegration into society, and make positive changes in the lives of motivated individuals in the community. This paper provides an initial implementation and evaluation plan for the Square One program.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>African American (AA) adolescents have the highest rates of obesity in the United States. AA males have the highest cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden of any ethnic subgroup; yet paradoxically, they have higher or equal rates of youth sports participation compared to their peers. As a prevention effort against obesity and CVD, pediatric lifestyle behavior counseling is delivered during outpatient clinic visits. However, whether clinic-based counseling creates sustainable positive behavior change is not clear. A partial-systematic review of the literature on coach-facilitated behavior change in the context of youth sports demonstrated promising results for creating sustainable lifestyle change in children. A primary study revealed that coach-lead nutritional behavior change in youth athletes has the potential to create sustainable health behavior change. Greater than eighty percent of children participate play sports. Therefore, a behavior intervention in this context may demonstrate sustainable and positive health effect for AA male youth and all children.</dc:description>
