See https://internal.lib.unc.edu/wikis/staff/index.php/TRLN_Discovery_(online_catalog)[documentation on staff wiki] for general info/definitions and links to further info.

== TRLN Discovery data model

"Argot" -- the intermediary data language we're using

Documentation/specification is at: https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/tree/master/argot

*Files in that directory include:*

* argot.xlsx - main spreadsheet with Argot field definitions and source data-to-Argot mapping rules
* _fields.csv - quick look at fields tab from argot.xlsx
* _mappings.csv - quick look at mappings tab from argot.xlsx


Data mapping examples, very MARC-centric at this point are in: https://github.com/trln/data-documentation/tree/master/argot/spec_docs
